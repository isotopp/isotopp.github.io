      <title>Software Supply Chain Issues</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/10/18/software-supply-chain-issues.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The GitHub Security Lab has a long hard look at &amp;ldquo;Apache Commons Text&amp;rdquo; in March this year.
That resulted in &lt;a href=&#34;https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2022-018_Apache_Commons_Text/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CVE-2022-42889&lt;/a&gt;

.
The exploit goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;StringSubstitutor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;interpolator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;StringSubstitutor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;createInterpolator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;interpolator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;${script:javascript:java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec(&amp;#39;touch /tmp/foo&amp;#39;)}&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next to &lt;code&gt;${script:...}&lt;/code&gt; there are apparently also a &lt;code&gt;${url:...}&lt;/code&gt; and `${dns} as other unsuitable substitutions, and they nest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was fixed in October 2022, after being reminded by GHSL in May and August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was introduced in October 2018, in Version 1.5, and only discovered in March this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;whats-wrong-with-this&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#whats-wrong-with-this&#34;&gt;
	What&amp;rsquo;s wrong with this?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security impact of this new feature is obvious, when discussed.
Yet, it was integrated in October 2018, and that apparently did not raise any red flags in a security or merge review.
Also, none of the users of the library found anything weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The package has &lt;a href=&#34;https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/userguide.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;

.
String substitution is described in the manpage for that class, &lt;a href=&#34;https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/apidocs/org/apache/commons/text/StringSubstitutor.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;StringSubstituror&lt;/a&gt;

.
The &amp;ldquo;fix&amp;rdquo; for the CVS was to disable some substitutors.
This is described in &lt;a href=&#34;https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/apidocs/org/apache/commons/text/lookup/StringLookupFactory.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;StringLookupFactory&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took almost 3.5 years for somebody to look at this and find that to be a security risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reporting the risk, it took Apache 2 reminders and way more than the standard 90 days to react and publish a mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nonfunctional feature and security impact review for code merges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;slow reaction to security issues (CVSS 3.x score: 9.8)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the security process of the Apache organisation has huge room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;is-that-a-good-mitigation&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#is-that-a-good-mitigation&#34;&gt;
	Is that a good mitigation?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You decide. Among the interpolations that are still enabled by default are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/apidocs/org/apache/commons/text/lookup/StringLookupFactory.html#fileStringLookup--&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;fileStringLookup&lt;/a&gt;

, which replaces the &lt;code&gt;${file:UTF-8:/filename}&lt;/code&gt; with the content of a file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/apidocs/org/apache/commons/text/lookup/StringLookupFactory.html#propertiesStringLookup--&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;propertiesStringLookup&lt;/a&gt;

, which replaces a value for a key in a properties file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/apidocs/org/apache/commons/text/lookup/StringLookupFactory.html#environmentVariableStringLookup--&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;environmentVariableStringLookup&lt;/a&gt;

, which replaces &lt;code&gt;${env:USER}&lt;/code&gt; with the content of an environment variable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All have the potential, if controlled by an attacker, to read and leak data, and maybe secrets.
That is not remote code execution, but probably still arbitrary file read and secrets leak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a string interpolation under control of a user is risky at best, but the default configuration is still far from secure, even if the fix improves things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;not-the-first-time&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#not-the-first-time&#34;&gt;
	Not the first time
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This situation seems to be a repeat of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;log4j exploit&lt;/a&gt;

 from the year before.
In the log4j case, the initial find was presented on a conference and dismissed as unimportant.
It only escalated after the exploit was used in the wild against Minecraft servers and their associated Discords, and then it quickly escalated to the full scope we observed last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handling this was imperfect as well, with a series of fixes trying to mitigate the problem, and failing to do so in the first round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So both projects/packages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accepted contribution of text interpolation without understanding the implications that thing would have&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bungled the security response process, in various ways (slow response, or no response at all)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This points to non-functional processes inside the collection of Apache projects.
They are either not executed, or they are not effective, when executed.
The meta-question is if the collection of Apache projecs are aware of that, and how they are trying to address this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;are-there-more-packages-that-have-this-issue&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#are-there-more-packages-that-have-this-issue&#34;&gt;
	Are there more packages that have this issue?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a developer or organisation that makes software, you sometimes take on external dependencies.
You are still being asked to be able to answer questions about the whole product, so you need a way to form an opinion about the state of the dependencies and their dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That starts with an inventory, and some useful scoping.
And the mostly liveness, quality and maturity of processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;one-evaluation-approach&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#one-evaluation-approach&#34;&gt;
	One evaluation approach
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One quick evaluation approach is documented &lt;a href=&#34;https://askcloudarchitech.com/posts/tutorials/open-source-security-dependency-review/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;

.
I&amp;rsquo;d reorder things a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Is it necessary&amp;rdquo;-Phase: Do we need that dependency?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Is it popular&amp;rdquo;-Phase: Who else is using this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Is it maintained&amp;rdquo;-Phase: Do we see commits? Do we understand the code and the commits?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Is Security considered&amp;rdquo;-Phase: Check their security response process and the execution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Is it supported&amp;rdquo;-Phase: Go check out their presence on various media.
How do you reach them?
Are they approachable or more on the Hugo/Cyrus spectrum of interaction?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;another-evaluation-approach&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#another-evaluation-approach&#34;&gt;
	Another evaluation approach
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another approach is documented &lt;a href=&#34;https://opensource.com/life/14/1/evaluate-sustainability-open-source-project&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is similar, and asks you to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;check contributions, and contributors. Read a bit of code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at the release history. Are the regular releases? A schedule?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user community. Are they talking to people? How?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Longevity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The general ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d add some kind of metric around process execution.
Check merge reviews, execution of security process and again, approachability and response times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;another-commercial-approach&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#another-commercial-approach&#34;&gt;
	Another, commercial approach
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some vendors are starting to approach this, for example &lt;a href=&#34;https://socket.dev/npm/package/@webassemblyjs/ast/overview/1.11.1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, this seems to be a largely unsolved problem.
Criteria are uneven across various attempts, projects and ecosystems.
Some languages or projects seem to have problems even with creating an inventory of dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Groups and Places</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/10/12/groups-and-places.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Oct 2022 06:07:08 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/10/12/groups-and-places.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a distributed, asynchronous environment, there is a need for distributed, asynchronous interaction.
This interaction is often written, but &amp;ldquo;writing&amp;rdquo; these days is actually a media-rich process that includes much more than letters.
It also needs to be able to build some structure, and some gateway to level up to more synchronous and even richer communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s have a chat about chats, and what properties they have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/10/groups-places-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Historically, chat was lines of text, without much structure. Even today, many geeks often propose IRC when chat solutions are being discussed in a corporate context. That is a very myopic way of thinking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first chat network I have been using was IRC &amp;ndash; Internet Relay Chat.
This has been in the late 80ies or early 90ies, so today I have had an interactive online presence on the upside of 25 years or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I got to use IQC, Jabber, Skype, Hangouts, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Slack and RocketChat, among many others.
I also got exposed to a number of collaborative document processing systems with chat-like properties:
the now defunct Google Wave (alias Apache Wave, now also mostly defunct), and its heir Google Docs, and a bunch of newer collaborative brainstorming tools from the School of Miro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these applications and chat systems are different, but they can be evaluated along a number of dimensions to understand chat systems better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/10/groups-places-02.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of my chat desktop from 2016. There are many like it, but this is mine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;location-and-discoverability&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#location-and-discoverability&#34;&gt;
	Location and Discoverability
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important functions any chat system has to have is enabling the right people to find each other.
There are two large classes of chat systems here: One uses groups, and the other uses places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups are just that: collections of people that talk to each other.
You write a message and sent it.
It is then visible to all members of the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with groups is that they are almost impossible to find.
They are invitation only.
A member of the group must have knowledge of you looking for the group, and then invite you to it.
In some messengers this will also form a new group, destroying the messaging history of the older group, in order to protect the privacy of the conversation happening before the new member joined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/10/groups-places-03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Discord chat system allows you to form small scale groups with fixed membership, even without having a &amp;ldquo;Discord Server&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better system uses Places (often called Rooms or Channels) instead of Groups.
A place is discoverable, you can &amp;ldquo;find&amp;rdquo; it, &amp;ldquo;go&amp;rdquo; to it, and &amp;ldquo;join&amp;rdquo; without being explicitly invited (permission and moderation systems often exist).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Places tend to proliferate, mechanism to group, order, tag and search them often exist.
In Discord, for example, Channels can be grouped into Categories, which are then grouped into &amp;ldquo;Servers&amp;rdquo;, the server having an owner, and often a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/10/groups-places-04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Discord chat system, showing the &amp;ldquo;heiseonline&amp;rdquo; discord server, with a channel named &lt;code&gt;#tierbilder&lt;/code&gt; (Animal Pictures) selected. Below that, a Category for &lt;code&gt;Sprachkanäle&lt;/code&gt; (Voice Channels) is seen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having Places instead of Groups is crucial for any communication system.
It gives you the capability to write instructions that send people somewhere, and enables people to find and go somewhere, gives them agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebooks Messenger and Facebook at Work&amp;rsquo;s greatest flaw is their Messenger, which does not have this feature.
It relies on Groups, and tries to mitigate that by coupling groups to Facebook &amp;ldquo;Groups&amp;rdquo; (discussion boards), auto-inviting people into the Facebook Group associated chat group.
This combines worst practices of several systems into one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Places can be persistent, they can exist without anyone being in them.
Places can also have one or multiple owners, which is the root of that Places&amp;rsquo; permission system and the source of all moderator power for that Place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;presence&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#presence&#34;&gt;
	Presence
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working asynchronously means that you will not be present in a chat at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a feature: It allows you to focus, and think straight, cutting deeply into problems.
It also allows you to be in another timezone than your communication partners and still contribute meaningfully to a collaborative effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It poses the problem of your communication partners not knowing your current communication status, and availability.
If they are blocked, they might need you, and it would help them to have some expectation of your response times, availability and context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All modern chat systems have a presence mechanism, a semi-automatic status tagline, and the more thoughtfully engineered ones also know your timezone and show it to your peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/10/groups-places-05.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Slack chat system allows users to set a status in the form of an Emoji and a tagline. These are automatically cleared after some preset time, if desired. Slack also understands time zones, and will show you out-of-office times of communication partners, when necessary. Clicking on a user will also reveal their location and local time. On the right hand side, a number of status bubble examples are shown.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presence management in chat system often goes hand in hand with logging.
Messages sent to you in your absence are logged, and shown to you on reconnect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all a giant step forward from IRC, which did not manage presence well, and also did not allow sending messages to disconnected users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In IRC, being offline means not being present: people fall off the channel and what is being said with them being not there is lost to them.
That is of course a nuisance, and so people have been using programs such as screen to run an IRC client even when they have been disconnected from their computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IRC&amp;rsquo;s mechanism for presence (here: attention) is somewhat hidden &amp;ndash; the &lt;code&gt;/away&lt;/code&gt; command.
But not only is the mechanism hidden (it is another command that needs to be learned and used), but the status is somewhat hidden as well.
You can&amp;rsquo;t see if somebody is &lt;code&gt;/away&lt;/code&gt; unless you look at them with a &lt;code&gt;/whois&lt;/code&gt;.
Or you learn about the fact that they are &lt;code&gt;/away&lt;/code&gt; only after the fact, when you say something to them and get an auto-response with their &lt;code&gt;/away&lt;/code&gt; message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people do not like this, and so they use another mechanism and change their nicknames when they are not there &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Isotopp&amp;rdquo; becomes &amp;ldquo;Isotopp|AFK&amp;rdquo; or similar.
This is less structured than &lt;code&gt;/away&lt;/code&gt;, and so some people suffix their names, some prefix them and others completely change their nicknames - &amp;ldquo;Isotopp&amp;rdquo; becomes &amp;ldquo;Awaytopp&amp;rdquo;.
The lack of facility, discoverable interface and standardization creates variant practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;logging-and-multi-device&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#logging-and-multi-device&#34;&gt;
	Logging and Multi-Device
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All modern chat clients have proper presence, even if not always as rich as in Slack.
Most also have unified logging.
That is, even absent users can receive messages and will see them when coming back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most users in 2022 have multiple devices, and multiple clients.
Most users want the entire messaging history, in order, and with all backlog, available on all their devices, so that they can switch between devices without losing context.
This usually includes new devices, to facilitate moving to new laptops or cellphones, without losing history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This often clashes with old standards, badly designed security mechanisms and other implementation details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/10/groups-places-06.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Google Talk log, with OTR encryption, viewed in a different Jabber client. The history is truncated, and OTR encrypted messages are not available in readable form in this client.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One extreme point for synchronisation is the Discord chat system, where not only history and messages are kept in sync across all clients, but even preferences are unified:
Setting the desktop client to dark mode will also set dark mode on the cellphone application, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another, opposite extreme point is Jabber, which has no common rule for disposition of messages, and by default will send messages only to one client, using either a preference system, the last active client, or &amp;ldquo;all known clients to the server at the point in time the message was sent&amp;rdquo;. A lot depends on server and clients used here, creating an unreliable and hard to control user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

	Deliverables - File and Image Sharing
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a corporate context, we use the communication mechanism as a vehicle to create and share documents, and have a discussion about the documents we work on collaboratively.
Mail was doing this in the past, with Quotes and with Attachments, but that is a very cumbersome, lossy and hard to discover mechanism.
Most companies have moved the collaboration process off mail, to a large extent, and towards chat and collaborative document systems such as Google Docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google had taken this one step further with structured chat.
The pioneer application for that has been the short-lived Google Wave:
Wave allowed a group of people to create things in a kind of chat bubble, only that this bubble could not just hold a line of text, but also other media including rich documents, images, bots or other things that interfaced with the Wave API.
Other users could comment on an item in a hierarchic comments-on-comment tree like in a discussion system, or directly edit the original item, incorporating their changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes were recorded and were undoable and replayable.
This allowed users to view the end result of a Wave, or review the process of building that result after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/10/groups-places-07.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Wave being used to collaboratively work on a shared document. The Wave contains the final document, but also the process that led to the end result.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way, Wave could have been a salvation from the hell of corporate email:
Waves produce results, documents or agreements.
They also record the history of how that result had been reached, and they allow people joining the process late to catch up and review what has happened before on their own terms.
No more full quotes, 13 levels deep, and no more dozens of copies of the same Word file, all slightly different, and with diverging side remarks from people somewhere in the organisation, which never made it back into the main document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wave failed, though, and for multiple reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the bigger reasons is that Wave was all mechanism and no purpose &amp;ndash; it could to many things, and offered all of them without stating what Wave itself or the various functions are there for.
One could use Wave to manage a world building and game session in a role playing game, as well as replace corporate email, or use it as a rather clunky and over-engineered word processor.
So Wave needed explanation and contextualisation - and above all, a purpose, but none was given.
Wave died, because it confused users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/10/groups-places-08.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A collaboratively edited document. Multiple watchers are shown as icons at the top of the screen. A chat window is open. Cursors and collaborators edits would be visible simultaneously editing the document in many places while it has been initially created.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wave&amp;rsquo;s legacy lives on, though.
Much of the functionality of Wave is present in Google Docs, including the side chat, collaborative editing, history recording and replay and many other functions.
Unlike Wave, Google&amp;rsquo;s shared document editing puts the purpose first, and the collaboration in the background.
This is matching people&amp;rsquo;s expectations much better, and is less overwhelming.
It does to have to be taught, or manually given purpose.
Instead, the purpose is built in, and immediately obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern chat systems are kind of the opposite:
They put their purpose (communication) first, and the documents ride in the back.
This happens either through URLs or through file transfer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All modern chat systems have a working file transfer, which is also aware of media types.
That means, not only can you drag and drop files into a 1:1 chat or a channel, but also images or animations, as well as audio files.
They are understood, and shown inline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with other mechanisms, such as threads, they enable unique workflows that go way past the unstructured ASCII-limited text of IRC.
For example, in many workplaces designers use the image capabilities of Slack, together with Slack threads, to share images, mockups and other things and then criticize or approve designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also where not only IRC, but also Jabber falls down.
Proper file sharing, inline media content and threading are things that may exist somewhere, in some Jabber extension, but are not generally interoperable or enabled without much configuration across a set of clients.
They might as well not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;we-were-lucky&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#we-were-lucky&#34;&gt;
	We were lucky
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the place I work at, we were lucky.
By the time Covid pushed people to work from home, we already had replaced mail almost completely.
I was down from thousands of mail messages per day on almost one hundred mailing lists to less than a dozen messages, and no mailing lists at all anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have moved to &lt;strong&gt;Facebook at Work&lt;/strong&gt; for non-realtime group communication.
Teams were using their Facebook groups to communicate announcements and progress to other teams, and have discussions with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internally and for support we moved to &lt;strong&gt;Slack&lt;/strong&gt;.
This was pushed with considerable force from below, after corporate initially being very fond of Facebook messenger, mostly because it was free and included in Facebook at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately FB messenger is utterly broken in many ways, and unsuited for any structured work communication without basically rewriting it from scratch.
There are many facets to its fractal brokenness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has groups, but no places.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Groups have limited attendance, and the limit is too small (the old &lt;code&gt;#live&lt;/code&gt; Jabber channel was mandatory for all people pushing deployments, and could not be reproduced in FB Messenger).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It ate data. Mentioning a filename &lt;code&gt;main.pl&lt;/code&gt; would inescapably turn this into a polish hostname &lt;a href=&#34;https://main.pl&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;main.pl&lt;/a&gt;

. More often than not, Messenger would detect a malware phishing attempt and prevent you from sending the message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It ate data. Mentioning URLs with array parameters (&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://example.com/bla?a=1&amp;amp;a=2&amp;amp;a=3%22&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://example.com/bla?a=1&amp;a=2&amp;a=3&#34;&lt;/a&gt;

) would make it parse the URL, representing the keys in a hash, and dropping the repeated keys, breaking the URL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It could not handle files, code formatting and many other things well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It could not do threads, which are a necessity in high volume support channels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, corp was forced to also purchase Slack on top of FB at Work, to prevent a more or less open revolt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had been using &lt;strong&gt;Google Drive and Google Office&lt;/strong&gt;, as well, across the company, and the collaborative features in it were well understood and used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heterogeneity of all of this posed to be not a problem, somewhat surprisingly.
In fact, in many cases, the mix-and-match approach enabled us to be flexible, and work around many tools limitations, and also to expand and integrate other things easily.
Other applications (e.g. Miro, but also many others) have since been added for many users, who have other, more specialized needs and requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also used to use BlueJeans, before the pandemic, and mostly from meeting room installations with dedicated hardware.
During Covid, Zoom became popular, and offered a richer and much better set of clients, especially on mobile devices (Laptops, Tablets, Cellphones), so we switched vendors here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key learnings are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We already had tooling for Remote First, but had hardly any need to use them properly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We were hardly using Email with all its glorious brokenness anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By happy accident, the core tools (FB at Work, Slack) had Places, not Groups, as a core metaphor, and people structured their work around these places.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborative document editing and a rich, structured chat complement each other well. But since Facebook and Google both are unable to make such a thing, we have yet another vendor integrated. This turned out to be an actual advantage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our key deficits have not been discussed at length here, but are related:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Office documents have very bad discoverability and Google Office has no places.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corollary: A process is needed and needs to be manually executed to move content from the collaborative phase to the publication phase, elsewhere.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By public decree in our place this is going to be Confluence, which has problems of its own, and also poses a document conversion problem (from Google to Confluence internal format, keeping structure).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code Collaboration is not part of other collaboration at all, and lives in a third, and entirely disconnected space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/10/10/pan-narrans-and-better-meetings.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 10 Oct 2022 12:13:14 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/10/10/pan-narrans-and-better-meetings.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you are looking for a better &lt;em&gt;Remote First&lt;/em&gt; culture, you are looking for better meetings.
If you go for better meetings, you will also have fewer of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/362504-the-anthropologists-got-it-wrong-when-they-named-our-species&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/10/pan-narrans-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The anthropologists got it wrong when they named our species Homo sapiens (&amp;lsquo;wise man&amp;rsquo;). In any case it&amp;rsquo;s an arrogant and bigheaded thing to say, wisdom being one of our least evident features. In reality, we are Pan narrans, the storytelling chimpanzee.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going for a written culture helps, going for storytelling will help even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;storytelling&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#storytelling&#34;&gt;
	Storytelling
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost 15 years ago, I wrote about an experience with the roleplaying game &lt;em&gt;Primetime Adventures&lt;/em&gt;.
If you are reading German, &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2008/10/05/drsrm-2008-primetime-adventures.html&#34;&gt;check it out&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things to take away from Primetime Adventures is that &amp;ldquo;on screen&amp;rdquo; nothing happens without reason, all interactions serve the story.
And the story is always about conflict:
Anything from misunderstandings to misaligned goals, from disagreement about a mission to disagreement about fundamental values, from friendly competition to outright fighting over starved resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end it does not matter, but screen time is always about the current conflict, because to the Storytelling Chimpanzee this is what it&amp;rsquo;s about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, at the core, also true about meetings.
If they are not about conflict, they are not worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does not have to be conflict about the people in the meeting.
The meeting does not have to resolve the conflict (but should progress it somewhow).
But in every meeting there is some kind of conflict in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember: Not all conflict is drama, in fact, most is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;understanding-conflict&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#understanding-conflict&#34;&gt;
	Understanding conflict
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when you go for meetings, prepare an Agenda.
If you are invited to a meeting without an Agenda, decline it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is a good Agenda?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make an agenda and make it self-contained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should itemize the things you would like to talk about.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each item should have a short summary (&amp;ldquo;What happened so far&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Last week on …&amp;rdquo;) or link to one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should invite the people you need to talk to about the thing, the stakeholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then send the agenda around well in advance, maybe share a link to a shared document.
Allow people to change, amend, and comment the agenda.
Force them to interact with the document in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your goal, ultimately, is to either not have a meeting, because all agree.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or have a meeting, but only about the things you disagree about.
Or people have questions about things, which can only be resolved interactively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So invite people to actually comment.
Invite long form, have them write in the text.
Sidenotes are horrible to read, and basically are good for &lt;strong&gt;+1&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/strong&gt; only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invite people to agree with you, in the document, or to specify where the disagreement is exactly.
Disagreement can take many forms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can be insecurity (&amp;ldquo;The plan looks good in principle, but I fear that…&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can be misalignment (&amp;ldquo;You want to do …, but we actually need … on our side.&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can be resource shortage (&amp;ldquo;You want … from us, but that would require us to …, and we can&amp;rsquo;t do that in this Quarter.&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can be many other things. It always signals a need to communicate more, about a specific thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;commenting-on-agendas-kills-meetings&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#commenting-on-agendas-kills-meetings&#34;&gt;
	Commenting on Agendas kills meetings
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the Agenda and the Agenda Prep to collect agreement.
If there is no disagreement, it&amp;rsquo;s fine to not have the meeting, because the reason to have one just vanished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is disagreement, you now know where, and how, and what specifically is the perceived or real problem.
You can spend interactive time exactly on these things, and go over possible reconciliations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is all in a shared document, y&amp;rsquo;all can amend the discussion with additional writing and sidenotes as needed.
This is automatically also the meeting notes, so make sure they contain whatever the outcomes are y&amp;rsquo;all collectively agreed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark up deliverables, deadlines and people responsible.
Set a deadline with a followup meeting (which you can then try to kill in advance, too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;kickoffs-cannot-be-killed&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#kickoffs-cannot-be-killed&#34;&gt;
	Kickoffs cannot be killed
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One exception are kickoff meetings.
They exist to present the project, and project goals, to set the framework and to make sure you are talking to the right people, and &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the right people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They exist also for socializing, specifically to enable people to make the necessary connections.
You will be working together, you need to know each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So make it short, to the point, and make sure people can connect with each other directly afterwards, on their own.
This is important, because kickoffs cannot be killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reporting-meetings-can-focus-on-interesting-stuff&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#reporting-meetings-can-focus-on-interesting-stuff&#34;&gt;
	Reporting meetings can focus on interesting stuff
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding conflict, isolating interesting topics to talk about, also applies to reporting meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reporting meetings always read a lot of slides with a lot of numbers.
Everybody zones out.
&amp;ldquo;Last weeks SLOs for … were met completely, and we improved …&amp;rdquo;
Nobody is interested, skip that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all can look at the green in the report in advance.
Instead use the reporting meeting to speak about interesting things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be the &lt;em&gt;story&lt;/em&gt; of an outage, and what we learned.
It can be about the &lt;em&gt;story&lt;/em&gt; of an improvement, and how it will prevent a certain class of failure.
Or tell the &lt;em&gt;story&lt;/em&gt; of how you work, how you improve work, or how you work differently than other companies do, if that is useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing &lt;em&gt;stories&lt;/em&gt; about practice is much more interesting that reading numbers from a slide that is all green anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or skip the meeting.
If the numbers are all fine and there are no learnings, no interaction is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;making-it-interesting-making-it-valuable&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#making-it-interesting-making-it-valuable&#34;&gt;
	Making it interesting, making it valuable
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, finding out, in advance, what the meeting should be about, always means finding the conflict, determining its nature, and the stakes.
Uneven information, misaligned goals, differences about implementation or scope, resource allocation, whatever.
Knowing this, maybe even preparing alternatives, and then either developing or discovering them interactively, or deciding on them collectively helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also automatically prepares the meeting minutes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Agenda collects agreement, and preparing the meeting from the residual conflict in the Agenda then makes it simple to have minutes.
We have shared documents in 2022, so there is an easy way to make sure all voices are recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;providing-value&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#providing-value&#34;&gt;
	Providing value
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shared documents are also a burden:
They are hard to discover, maintain and organize.
I am increasingly a supporter of the idea that Google Docs should auto-delete after 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want deliverables, put them elsewhere, anywhere.
Heck, even Confluence would be a better location than a Google Drive.
In any case, you can create a consolidated version of the current state in a proper document, and then collect or link the path that led to it and attach it as documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t take meeting notes and call them deliverables, though.
That won&amp;rsquo;t work.
It never did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a discussion with interactive and written elements, is also a documentation evolution process, in which we collectively work on a deliverable: the architecture, documentation and implementation of a process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a proper store, and not in shared documents, much less in volatile spoken discussion without any record or recording.
We work to distill information, to shape an idea, and to bring it into the world, in a proper deliverable and in code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because that is what a company is about:
Making agreements on how we work together on a common thing (and building infrastructure to make this easier).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we have meeting agendas to collect agreement, and to sharpen disagreement, we have interactive meetings to find and ultimately document conflict resolutions, and we then put these back into the deliverable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the heart of asynchronous distributed collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if somebody asks you:
&amp;ldquo;What did your org learn to do differently in the last 3 years?&amp;rdquo;
and the answer is unlike the above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did you do instead? How did your org evolve?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;addenda&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#addenda&#34;&gt;
	Addenda
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This started out as a Twitter thread.
There have been reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Florian Haas pointed to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://xahteiwi.eu/resources/presentations/devopsdays-berlin-2022/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;really good writeup&lt;/a&gt;

 about writing of his.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He also mentions: &amp;ldquo;Re project kickoffs, never do them without preparing a 5-paragraph brief. Better still, circulate it ahead of the kickoff.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>MySQL: Local and distributed storage</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/09/27/mysql-local-and-distributed-storage.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2022 12:13:14 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/09/27/mysql-local-and-distributed-storage.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Where I work, we are using MySQL in a scale-out configuration to handle our database needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means, you write to a primary server, but reads generally go to a replica database further down in a replication tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of additional requirements that should not concern you as a developer make it a little bit more elaborate than a simple &amp;ldquo;primary and a number of replicas&amp;rdquo; configuration.
But the gist of all that is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is always a read-copy of the database very close to your application, latency wise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are always sufficient copies of the data around so that we can afford to run our databases on unraided local storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature of our databases is such, that we drown all data reads with sufficient memory, where ever that is possible.
Our databases are Memory Engines, when it comes to reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I joke about that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You, too, can be a successful database performance consultant:
Say “Buy more memory!” and “There is an index missing” as needed.
Add “That’s going to be expensive”, if you work for SAP or Oracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is true: Reads are really bad for databases.
Here is what a database workload looks like when the database does not fit into memory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/09/local-storage-01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Graph based on data recorded with &lt;code&gt;blktrace&lt;/code&gt;, analyzed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oakgatetech.com/applications/analytics&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Workload Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;

 from Oakgate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workload shown here is too large to have its working set inside the InnoDB Buffer Pool provided.
We do see a constant stream of reads over time, to the tune of several MB/s and up to ~1000 IO Operations per Second (IOPS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had this database more memory, the reads would instead hit cached blocks in memory and would eventually be served from RAM.
We would see read requests at the database layer, but they would be satisfied from the database&amp;rsquo;s Buffer Pool and not hit the disk.
Only the write load remains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;but-arent-writes-worse-then&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#but-arent-writes-worse-then&#34;&gt;
	But aren&amp;rsquo;t writes worse, then?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is an interesting question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can drown reads with cache, but we can&amp;rsquo;t drown writes much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They eventually have to go to the disk, and in order to be ACID compliant, we need to delay the COMMIT until the write has hit a persistent storage layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on our persistence requirements, we demand that the write&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hits a machine-local persistent storage (a disk, a NVME or a battery backed cache unit (BBU)),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hits at least a second machine or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hits a second machine in another availability zone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing the requirements introduces more latency, and brings down our maximum write rate due to increased wait time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But uncached reads are worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/09/local-storage-02.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Writes can build deep queues, but for reads that is hardly happening. This is a key observation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we send writes to storage, we can do that asynchronously:
We fire off the write, and while we delay the commit and wait for the write to complete, we can do other things.
That is possible, because these other writes are – to a large extent – independent of the outcome of previous writes, as long as ordering guarantees are being held up.
Writes are a stream that continuously flows and that can be queued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reads are not, at multiple levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Databases read data from indexes, and indexes are mostly data structures such as balanced trees, with a large fan-out.
If you have more data than fits into memory and sensible indexes, the index is approximately four layers deep.
You will need around four media accesses to get from the root to the desired data, assuming no caching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why approximately four layers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a tree, the depth of the tree is the logarithm of the number of records to the base of the fan-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a billion records and a fan-out of 200 at each level, you get a tree depth of 3.91.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fewer records will make it a bit more shallow: Depth 2.60 for a million records at a width of 200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A smaller fan-out will make it a bit deeper:
a million records with a fan-out of 20 instead of 200 will give you a depth of 4.61
(Remember, we are working with pages of 16 KB size, so a fan-out of only 20 is incredibly small).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, all balanced trees in our databases will be approximately 4 layers deep, because log(n)/log(fan-out) is practically a constant valued around 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, even for large data we can completely cache the inner tree, so this comes down to 4 disk read requests and one actual disk read.
But: In such a lookup, each disk read is completely dependent on the outcome of the previous disk read.
The reads are all serialized by disk accesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, again, underlines the importance of memory in database operation.
&amp;ldquo;Buy more memory, then invest into more memory&amp;rdquo; is an extremely sensible piece of advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we actually do not just read data from a single table.
Often we join two tables.
In a loop join, we join two tables with SQL of the form&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;somecolumn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;someothercolumn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;JOIN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;aid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;aid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;some&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;conditions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will grab rows from &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, hopefully using an index (see above for index reads), and then take the rows from &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; as they are generated. It will use the &lt;code&gt;a.aid&lt;/code&gt; values emitted and apply them to look up &lt;code&gt;b.aid&lt;/code&gt; rows in table &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, we can&amp;rsquo;t know which rows in &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; we are interested in before we haven&amp;rsquo;t completed the reads on &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;.
Read accesses on &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; are dependent on the outcome and hence completion of our (indexed) reads on &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is not a good way to build deep queues:
Work stalls until the previous reads are done – unless we provide sufficient memory for the reads to not happen in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-do-reads-and-writes-look-like-in-reality&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-do-reads-and-writes-look-like-in-reality&#34;&gt;
	What do reads and writes look like in reality?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meet our availability databases.
They are holding hotel room availability information.
This database is running on bare metal, 16C/32T, 128 GB memory and two SSD on a controller with a battery backed cache unit (BBU).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/09/local-storage-03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The box is serving mostly reads, 4746 in the last second, and as a replica sees writes only from upstream.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The box is currently holding a few TB of data, serving around between 6000 and 12000 queries per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement mix looks like Java: around 50% of the statements are &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt;, the large percentage of &lt;code&gt;SET&lt;/code&gt; statements is indicative of the JDBC driver and the rest is DML and transaction management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/09/local-storage-04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The box is currently running at a load of 9, but it is early morning, and we have a load peak in the evening. At a load of 12, it has sufficient capacity to carry on, if we lose an AZ and have to fold the failing data centers load into the surviving machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of hardware with this kind of workload will become uncomfortably jittery at a load of 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/09/local-storage-05.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also observe variable read load of around 1000-ish IOPS, spiking into the 4000&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works well. How well?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/09/local-storage-06.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observe read and write latencies on a µs scale, that is 10^-6, millionth seconds.i
2000 µs are 2ms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read latencies are layered curtains with peaks at 0.2 ms, 0.26 ms, 0.33 ms, 0.45 ms and 0.58 ms.
We could draw a large gauss curve over the entire thing, peaking at 0.33 ms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write latencies are&amp;hellip; nonexistent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we zoom in, we can see that disk writes seem to happen at a latency of 40 µs, 0.04 ms.
That&amp;rsquo;s to the tune of a PCIe bus transfer – a 256 Byte bus transfer takes around 100 ns, 40 µs are good for about 12-ish KB worth of bus time, and for comparison, 16 KB is the size of a MySQL data page written out.
The numbers check out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the time it takes to transfer 16 KB of data from a MySQL Buffer Pool in RAM to the 4 GB worth BBU cache on the HP SmartArray controller card, which counts as locally persistent.
The ARM CPU on the controller will then take all these writes, sort them, batch them and write them out to the SSD in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All together that works very well:
This blade costs around 150 Euro per month, per machine, over a reservation interval of 5 years.
It stores 1 TB of logical data in 1 TB of physical disk space.
And it performs at amazingly low and stable latency numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not redundant at the machine level – we are using other, database level technologies to achieve that.
Using replication, we make copies of the data on this machine on other machines and in other data centers.
This allows us to utilize redundancy for capacity, but also for availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does so at a cost that also allows us to completely eliminate additional cache layers such as memcached – also eliminating the entire class of cache incoherency bugs that came with memcached usage, until 2012, when we removed memcached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;changing-the-equation&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#changing-the-equation&#34;&gt;
	Changing the Equation
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introducing distributed storage into the equation changes the properties of the underlying storage fundamentally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your storage is no longer machine local, and for reasons that are transcending the scope of this post, it is also always replicated – usually with a replication factory of n=3.
That is, 1 TB of data in the database becomes 3 TB of data on disk, 1 TB on each of three different machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traversing the datacenter in our on-premises data center takes around 60 µs, plus the time to write data to locally persistent storage makes it 100 µs, 0.1ms, for each hop.
Multiple copies and coordination add up, and the end result is a write time distribution with a maximum of 0.9 ms for the storage tested here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read latencies have the same shape, but are somewhat lower – we need one copy of the data to read it, not all of them, so we come out at around 0.6ms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/09/local-storage-07.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Latency diagrams for read and write latencies of our Ceph storage are r=0.6 ms, w=0.9 ms. This is amazingly low for Ceph – a Ceph cluster in 2015 would have been around 5.0 ms.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running a database with a comparable profile on top of this storage changes database behavior a lot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/09/local-storage-08.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read latencies compared: Above, the graph from the local machine, below a comparable workload on Ceph volumes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have reads, and read latencies are approximately twice as high as on a local SSD.
We have discussed how reads don&amp;rsquo;t queue well, as the results of later reads are often dependent on the results of previous reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means we have lowered the read capacity of an instance by 2, for the same number of connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could, in increasing order of engineering and monetary cost&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add memory to quench the reads in an increased buffer pool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add boxes to the pool, at the cost of additional instances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add connections and query the database with multiple parallel tasks, trying to engineer our workload to be more parallel shaped&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this hierarchy under test, the second thing happened:
we scaled up the number of instances in order to deal with the query load under worsened read latency.
And we should try the first thing:
use instances with more memory to make the disk accesses go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the writes, the picture changed completely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/09/local-storage-09.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Write latencies compared: Above, the graph from the local storage machine, below a comparable workload on Ceph volumes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writes now take 0.9 ms instead of 0.04 ms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, while the write latency histogram is nicely Gauss-shaped, it does have a considerable base width:
The 0.9 ms is actually the base of a curve that goes from 0.6 ms to 1.6 ms on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writes queue nicely, and the storage here is performing extremely well under parallel load in benchmarks.
So many parallel writes should work well:
Each write takes 0.9-ish ms, but you can do many of them in flight at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, transactional workloads do not have that shape.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/11/08/mysql-parallel-replication.html&#34;&gt;Parallel replication&lt;/a&gt;

 is subject to a number of constraints regarding reordering, and also subject to limitations that result from implementation details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/09/local-storage-10.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Replication delay over time: Despite parallel replication being active, the instance cannot keep up with the write load. Only careful write modulation keeps the replica from delaying even more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is not even a high write load: The statement mix shown here did not even touch the 1000 inserts/s barrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/09/local-storage-11.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the storage statistics are absolutely devastating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/09/local-storage-12.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see somewhat over 1000 reads and 1000 writes per second on the volume, which are good considering the latencies we see above, but devoid of parallism.
The I/O we see is good for an aggregate I/O of 22 MB/s, and results in complete saturation of the Disk I/O.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no easy way around this, except deep changes to the application to make it write differently.
But we do not really want to spend application business unit developer time on &amp;ldquo;code around the intricacies of the storage solution we chose&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;solve business problems&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recommendation to use local storage in the virtualized environment still stands, as it performs better and does not provide storage-level redundancy for which we have no use, given that replication provides capacity &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; redundancy at the database level.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MySQL: Data for Testing</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/09/26/mysql-data-for-testing.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2022 12:13:14 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/09/26/mysql-data-for-testing.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Where I work, there is an ongoing discussion about test data generation.
At the moment we do not replace or change any production data for use in the test environments, and we don&amp;rsquo;t generate test data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is safe and legal, because production data is tokenized.
That is, PII and PCI data is being replaced by placeholder tokens which can be used by applications to access the actual protected data through specially protected access services.
Only a very limited circle of people is dealing with data in behind the protected services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using production data in test databases is also fast, because we copy data in parallel, at line speed, or we make redirect-on-write (&amp;ldquo;copy-on-write&amp;rdquo; in the age of SSD) writeable snapshots available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume for a moment we want to change that and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mask data from production when we copy it to test databases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reduce the amount of data used in test databases, while maintaining referential integrity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;generate test data sets of any size instead of using production data, keeping referential integrity and also some baseline statistical properties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;masking-data&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#masking-data&#34;&gt;
	Masking Data
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume we make a copy of a production database into a test setup.
We then prepare that copy by changing every data item we want to mask, for example by replacing it with &lt;code&gt;sha(&amp;quot;secret&amp;quot; + original value)&lt;/code&gt;, or some other replacement token.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why are we using a hash function or some moral equivalent for this?
We want to keep referential integrity, of course.
So each occurence of &lt;code&gt;Kristian Köhntopp&lt;/code&gt; will be replaced by &lt;code&gt;9697c8770a3def7475069f3be8b6f2a8e4c7ebf4&lt;/code&gt;, a predictable and stable value, instead of a random number &lt;code&gt;17&lt;/code&gt; on the first occurence, and another random number, &lt;code&gt;25342&lt;/code&gt;, on the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of database work, it means that after copying the data, we are running an &lt;code&gt;update&lt;/code&gt; on every row, creating a binlog entry for each change.
If the column we change is indexed, the indexes that contain the column need to be updated.
If the column we change is a primary key, the physical location of the record in the table also changes, because InnoDB clusters data on primary key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, while copying data is fast, masking data has a much, much higher cost and can nowhere run at line speed, on any hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;reducing-the-amount-of-data&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#reducing-the-amount-of-data&#34;&gt;
	Reducing the amount of data
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in the company history, around 15 years ago, a colleague worked on creating smaller test databases by selecting a subset of production data, while keeping referential integrity intact.
He failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many others tried later, we have had projects trying this around every 3 to 5 years.
They also failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each attempt always selects either an empty database or all of the data from production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s try a simple model:
We have users, we have hotels, and they are in a n:m relationship, the stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/09/test-data-01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Kris&amp;rdquo; stays in a Hotel, the &amp;ldquo;Casa&amp;rdquo;.
We select Kris into the test data set from production, and also the &amp;ldquo;Casa&amp;rdquo;.
Other people stayed at the Casa, so they also are imported into the test set, but they also stayed at other hotels, so these hotels are also imported, and so forth, back between two tables.
After 3 reflections, 6 transitions, we have selected the entire production database into the test set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our production data is interconnected, and retaining referential integrity of the production data will mean that selecting one will ultimately select all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limiting the timeframe can help:
we select only data from the past week or something.
But that has other implications, for example on the data distribution.
Also, our production data is heavily skewed in time when it comes to operations on availability – a lot of bookings happen in the last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;generating-test-data&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#generating-test-data&#34;&gt;
	Generating test data
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generating garbage data is fast, but still slower than making a copy.
That is because copying data from a production machine can copy binary files with prebuilt existing indexes, whereas generating garbage data is equivalent to importing a &lt;code&gt;mysqldump&lt;/code&gt;.
The data needs to be parsed, and worse, all indexes need to be built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we can copy data at hundreds of MB per second, up into the GB/s range, importing data happens at single digit MB/s up to low tens of MB/s.
A lot depends on the availability of RAM, and on the speed of the disk, also on the number of indexes and if the input data is sorted by primary key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generating non-garbage data is also hard, and slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to have the list of referential integrity constraints either defined or inferred from a schema.
At work, our schema is large, much larger than a single database or service – users in the user service (test user service, with test user data) need to be referenced in the reservations service (test reservations service with test bookings), referring to hotels in the test availability and test hotel store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means either creating and maintaining a consistent second universe, or creating this, across services, from scratch, for each test.
One is a drag on productivity (maintaining consistent universes is a lot of work), the other is slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistency is not the only requirement, though.
Consistency is fine if you want to test validation code (but my test names are not utf8, they are from the hex digit subset of ASCII!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you want to talk performance, additional requirements appear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data size&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your production data is 2 TB in size, but your test set is 200 GB, it is not linearly 10x faster.
The relationship is non-linear: On a given piece of hardware, production data may be IO-limited because the working set does not fit into memory, whereas the test data can fit WSS into memory.
Production data will produce disk reads proportionally to the load, test data will run from memory and after warmup has no read I/O – a completely different performance model applies.
Performance tests on the test data have zero predictive value for production performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Distribution.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production data and production data access is subject to data access patterns that are largely unknown and undocumented, and are also changing.
Some users are whales that travel 100x more than norms.
Other users are frequent travellers, and travel 10x more than norms.
Some amount of users are one-offs and appear only once in the data set.
What is the relation between these sets, and what is the effect they have on data access?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-database-benchmark-i-lost&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#a-database-benchmark-i-lost&#34;&gt;
	A database benchmark I lost
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The german computer magazine c&amp;rsquo;t in 2006 had an application benchmark described in web request accesses to a DVD rental store.
The contestants were supposed to write a DVD rental store using any technology they wished, defined in the required output and the URL request they would be exposed to in testing.
MySQL, for which I worked as a consultant, wanted to participate, and for that I put the templates provided into a web shop using MySQL, and tuned shop and database accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got nowhere the top 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is because I used a real web shop with real assumptions about user behavior, including caches and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test data used was generated, and the requests were equally distributed:
Each DVD in the simulated DVD store was equally likely to be rented and each user rented the same amount of DVDs.
Any cache you put into the store would overflow, and go into threshing, or would have to have sufficient memory to keep the entire store in cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real DVD rental stores have a top 100 of popular titles, and a long tail. Caching helps.
In the test, caching destroyed performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;another-database-benchmark-i-lost&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#another-database-benchmark-i-lost&#34;&gt;
	Another database benchmark I lost
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another german computer magazine had another database benchmark, which basically hammered the system under test with a very high load.
Unfortunately, here the load was not evenly distributed, but a few keys were being exercised very often, whereas a lot of keys were never requested.
Effectively the load generator has a large number of threads, and each thread was exercising &amp;ldquo;their&amp;rdquo; key in the database &amp;ndash; thread 1 to id 1 in the table, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exercised a certain number of hot keys, and waited very fast on a few locks, but did not actually simulate accurately any throughput limits.
If you exercised the system with more production-like load, it would have had around 100x more total throughput.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;tldr&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#tldr&#34;&gt;
	TL;DR
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Producing masked or simulated data for testing is around 100x more expensive computationally than copying production data.
If production data is already tokenized, the win is also questionable, compared to the effort spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Producing valid test data is computationally expensive, especially in a microservices architecture in which referential integrity is to be maintained across service boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valid test data is not necessarily useful in testing, especially when it comes to performance testing.
Performance testing is specifically also dependent on data access patterns, working set sizes and arrival rate distributions that affect locking times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, the actual test environment is always production, and in my personal professional experience there is a lot more value in making testing in production safe than in producing accurate testing environments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MySQL: Sometimes it is not the database</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/09/19/sometimes-it-is-not-the-database.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2022 12:13:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/09/19/sometimes-it-is-not-the-database.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Query latencies in one data center are larger than elsewhere for one replication hierarchy, but only in the high percentiles.
This impacts production and traffic is being failed away from that data center to protect production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the P50 and P90 look okay, but the P99 and the P99.9 do not, the database(s) operate normally, and only some queries are running slow.
The initial guess was &amp;ldquo;for some queries the plan has flipped, but only in that data center.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at the database size and the schema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-tiny-database&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#a-tiny-database&#34;&gt;
	A tiny database
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The schema in question holds metadata for a change data capture process, and that is not a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; du -sh *
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;0    coredumps
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;5.6G    data
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;704M    log
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;0    tmp
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; du -sh data/theschema
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;93M    data/theschema
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;and in memory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/09/not-the-database-01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The mysqld process has a RES (resident set size) of only 5.9GB, even if the database is allowed to grow to a VIRT (virtual memory size) of 71.8 G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is running on a bare metal blade for the moment, and these do not come smaller than this.
In a virtual machine, it can be as small as a 1/4 blade – but database instances have a fixed overhead and going much smaller hardly makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, this is running off memory, and would be doing so even if hosted on an iPhone.
There can&amp;rsquo;t be disk scans, even if there were bad queries.
And even with memory scans a thing this tiny won&amp;rsquo;t exhaust CPU or scan for a long time in memory.
Something definitively smells funny around here.&lt;/p&gt;

The tables are optimized for fast data collection.
Data is not locked during read as to not slow collection, times are reported in PicoSeconds (1/10^12) as to avoid any DIV instructions on write and buffers are size-limited so if some action is spamming &lt;code&gt;P_S&lt;/code&gt;, data is lost, but the server does not slowed or losing memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently we divide by 10^9 to get average statement runtime, and we report any statement statistics since server start (or table truncate) that have been collected for any statement.
It turns out, the production user has been running only select statements, set statements and show warnings commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the averages look good, maxima are not:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We onboard this hierarchy to Vividcortex, a monitor that collects performance data from databases, and allows to see specific queries that execute slowly.
It can also help in determining possible improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vividcortex inventory for streaming. Normally Vividcortex does not run on all instances, but the primary and one pooled replica. We wanted a specific pooled replica in Frankfurt, though, so something with a 6000 number.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our normal Vividcortex onboarding installs probes on the primary and one pooled replica, because it is not necessary to overwhelm the collection interface with all queries from all production machines.
A sample will do fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, we want a replica in a specific location, though: only one data center behaves abnormally, so we would want one more machine within that location.
This required some bespoke puppet artistry, but it worked.
But, even then we do not get queries that are particularly interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/09/not-the-database-03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We get Query Count, and Average Latency.
But from the counts and the word average we can already see that this is not useful: we would have wanted to see high percentiles.
Also, the queries are all uninteresting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we believe most queries are fine, only some instances of queries that are mostly fine are taking unexpectedly long.
And we want to see those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can already see that the default view of VividCortex here is not helpful, and a quick exploration of the user interface quickly reveals that this tool is maybe not optimally useful for our specific hunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We go back to &lt;code&gt;P_S&lt;/code&gt; and handcraft our stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

	Huh? What? The structure of &lt;code&gt;P_S&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point it is maybe a good idea to stop and establish a few facts about &lt;code&gt;P_S&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;code&gt;P_S&lt;/code&gt; collects data about statement execution and server performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The server is instrumented for collection, and the data sources are called instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can ask an instrument to collect or not collect data for certain monitoring users, certain actors.
We can also ask the instruments ignore certain tables, schemas or other things, certain objects.
And again, the same, for certain threads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collected data is stored in preallocated ring-buffers, or added to certain aggregates.
All these things are consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Configuration happens through the setup tables above, which set up the data flow from instrument through the filtering dimensions to the consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Event data collection happens in event tables, inside a hierarchy, from transactions, to individual statements that make up a transaction, to execution phases of a statement, stages, to waits (mostly for IO or locks).
These things nest, but not necessarily on a 1:1 basis – a statement can contain waits, or other statements, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;streamingdb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;6001&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;performance_schema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;tables&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;like&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;event%current&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;events_transactions_current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;                  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;events_waits_current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;                         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;----------------------------------------------+
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;rows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each of these events, we have &lt;code&gt;_current&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;_history&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_history_long&lt;/code&gt; tables.
For example &lt;code&gt;events_statements_current&lt;/code&gt; contains one entry for each active connection, &lt;code&gt;events_statements_history&lt;/code&gt; the last few statements for each active connection, and &lt;code&gt;events_statements_history_long&lt;/code&gt; the last few thousand statements across all connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other collections, about other aspects of the server, and more generalized statement aggregations, the summaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;queries-and-query-digests&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#queries-and-query-digests&#34;&gt;
	Queries and Query Digests
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be able to aggregate statements, there is the concept of a statements &lt;code&gt;digest_text&lt;/code&gt;, and ultimately the &lt;code&gt;digest&lt;/code&gt;, a hash number generated from the digest text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So statements such as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;atable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;SeLeCt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;atable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;IN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;92929&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;29292&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;17654&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;363562&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;should be considered equivalent in an aggregate.
This is done by unparsing the statement from the parse tree, which gets rid of all the spacing and letter case differences in keywords.
During this, all constants and constant lists are replaced by &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&#39;?&#39;&lt;/code&gt; respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The digest text for the above two statements becomes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;atable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;and the digest from that can then be generated by running a hash function over the digest text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disadvantage is that a digest cannot be explained with the &lt;code&gt;EXPLAIN&lt;/code&gt; command, so we need to make sure to also keep a representative explainable version of the query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;getting-some-data&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#getting-some-data&#34;&gt;
	Getting some data
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case, &lt;code&gt;events_statements_summary_by_digest&lt;/code&gt; is exactly what we want.
So we truncate the collection, and wait a bit, then ask.
The results are impossible:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;performance_schema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;truncate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;events_statements_summary_by_digest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;query_sample_text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;SET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sql_mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;STRICT_ALL_TABLES,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION,STRICT_TRANS_TABLES&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we have completely internal configuration commands that sometimes take longer than 0.1ms to execute.
We have other instances of simple queries that sometimes take 14s to run, 1000x and more than the average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;and-then&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#and-then&#34;&gt;
	And then&amp;hellip;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, and that is as far as I got with my digging, when a colleague chimes in, pointing at  the machine dashboard for the machine I am on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/09/not-the-database-04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A sick network interface is for sure messing with system performance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the machines in the pooled replicas for this data center location is showing an elevated amount of network retransmits and the box probably needs some love from the data center operations engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We experiment a bit by removing and re-adding the box to the pool, and sure enough: As soon as the system under test is in the pool the latencies are no longer production worthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/09/not-the-database-05.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The image from the title bar: End user experience with and without the broken box in the replica pool. One bad box spoils the experience for all the users.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the root cause was not instances of one query executing badly, but all queries executing badly on one box of the pool, in one location.
Average query latencies, and even the P90 look good, but the P99 and the P99.9 go to hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The box is removed from the pool and a replacement has been scheduled.
The broken box will get a DCOE ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MySQL: Artifactory Conclusion</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/09/14/artifactory-conclusion.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2022 12:13:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/09/14/artifactory-conclusion.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago I was being drawn into the debug of artdb, the Replication hierarchy used by our Artifactory instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tldr&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#tldr&#34;&gt;
	TL;DR
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artifactory overloaded the database.
This was incident-handled by optimizing a number of slow queries using some covering index trickery, and by upgrading the hardware substantially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the runway we bought, we found and partially fixed the following problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fixed:&lt;/em&gt; A number of very expensive reporting queries were sped up 16x to 20x using covering indexes, from 180s runtime to 8s-12s runtime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fixed:&lt;/em&gt; We optimized our database and data size by completing the data lifecycle for several repo types, deleting old images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fixed:&lt;/em&gt; Hardware upgrade lowered load even more, and sped up the queries even more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fixed:&lt;/em&gt; Further investigation identified a synchronisation cron job which overloaded the database in 40m intervals. The cron job was throttled and is now on a backlog for refactoring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fixed:&lt;/em&gt; The long running queries were identified in the Artifactory source code, which allowed us and jFrog support to identify that a) the Artifactory internal cache for these queries was bypassed and b) this happens when certain JMX monitoring options are enabled, per application host hitting the database instance. The monitoring was temporarily disabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fixed:&lt;/em&gt; For each image download, Artifactory writes statistics updates, which can lead to lock contention on hot images. We identified a configuration that could turn this off, and later found that these updates can be happening batched in the background.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unfixed:&lt;/em&gt; Artifactory does not understand the concept of Replicas and database scale-out at all, it can only do database scale-up, and that has absolute limits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The database workload for Artifactory is now well below critical levels and has on the current, upgraded hardware runway for estimated 4x growth.
Beyond that, vertical scaling is going to be hard without changes to the architecture of Artifactory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artifactory is a third party piece of software that stores binary objects in one of several BLOB storages and serves them up to people who need binaries in whatever way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several choices of BLOB storages for it, we are using S3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several choices of data delivery formats for Artifactory, we are using many of them, with &amp;ldquo;Docker Repository&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Maven Repository&amp;rdquo; being the most prominent use-cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artifactory is using a database as a metadata storage, and again, there are several possible choices.
We are using MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/09/artifactory-01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Binary Delivery Formats and Protocols supported by Artifactory (&lt;a href=&#34;https://jfrog.com/artifactory/%29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://jfrog.com/artifactory/)&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;overloaded-database&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#overloaded-database&#34;&gt;
	Overloaded Database
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original complaint was &amp;ldquo;Artifactory is down&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The database is overloaded&amp;rdquo;.
Investigation of that shows that this was very much true:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary of the replication hierarchy was a blade from 2017 with 12C/24T, and was showing load spiking into the 40-ies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/09/artifactory-02.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For a CPU-saturated MySQL on a 12C/24T, anything over 18-20 is probably not very stable and certainly not fun.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was looking at the load of the full replication hierarchy and found out multiple things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Artifactory does not understand the concepts of replication, multiple database handles or scale-out at the database level.
It only talks to the primary database, and can only scale vertically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Artifactory database is seeing a very large query load (&amp;gt; 20.000 QPS), which is comprised of a large number of reads and underneath still 1000s of writes per second.
Some of the reads are long running queries, with runtimes in the 180s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The long running queries have been sped up from 180s to 9s by applying covering indexes and some index order juggling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/08/25/mysql-boiling-jfrogs.html&#34;&gt;Boiling JFrogs&lt;/a&gt;

 for the full and detailed writeup of this phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;buying-runway&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#buying-runway&#34;&gt;
	Buying Runway
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solving the long runners, we found several other issues at the database level.
But first we threw more cores into the fire and scaled Artifactory vertically to buy more runway:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/09/artifactory-03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Blade 7 hardware type uses 2x $400 CPUs for 16C/32T. Blade 2A.1 hardware uses 2x $2100 CPUs for 32C/64T. At the same load, these more expensive CPUs are also clocked around 1 GHz faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we had this long running scan queries on memory-resident data, we were using a lot of CPU.
Even after the optimization, these were scans, but on less and better organized data with one level of indirection removed from each data access – so 16x to 20x faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, we had a base load of 12 on the Blade 7 with only 12C/24T.
Moving to the better equipped, but more expensive Blade 2A.1, we have 32C/64T, and at the same load, we gain around 1 GHz is clock speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/09/artifactory-04.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At a load of 12 on a Dual-4110, we have 6 cores busy per socket, running at 2400 MHz.
At a load of 12 on a Dual-6130, we have 6 cores out of many more busy, so we have budget for 3400 MHz clock, 1 GHz faster. The work completes faster, we have less concurrency and the load drops to 8, 4 cores per socket, and 3500 MHz until things stabilize.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern CPUs do not have the Power Budget and Thermal Budget to run all their cores at maximum clock speed all of the time.
The higher the load, the lower they need to clock in order to not melt or starve themselves of power.
Fortunately, being a web shop, we do not exercise the FPU a lot outside of the ML department, so &amp;ldquo;Normal&amp;rdquo; is the line that applies here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running the same workload on a higher level CPU keeps a lesser percentage of cores busy, which can then be clocked higher.
The workload is completed faster, and the level of concurrency is lower – you will actually see a lower Linux load on the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is also what happened in our case, we speed up the clock by slightly less than 1/3, and we get a load that is roughly 1/3 lower.
The replacement box, running the optimized queries, is humming along at a load of 5-10ish, which is okay for a machine of that class and size:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/09/artifactory-05.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Replacement machine is good for a load of ~40, but is running at 10 or less, so we are good. Further optimizations after 10-Sep show even more improvement, read on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stabilized things in a way that allowed further experimentation and exposed other problems that previously were invisible in all the fire and smoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-40-minute-pattern&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#a-40-minute-pattern&#34;&gt;
	A 40 Minute Pattern
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the various indicators reported by the database monitoring, we see a pronounced pattern that shows a 40 minute interval.
Something is pushing load into the database in waves, but we do not know what it is:
It is using the normal Artifactory production user and coming from one (but only one) of the Artifactory application boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/09/artifactory-06.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We see access patterns repeating at 40 minute intervals, and pushing various statistics up. The data indicates a read and write load (read heavy), from one Artifactory application machine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding the culprit took us quite some effort, because various other things interfered (among them Puppet re-enabling itself and undoing debug config changes).
In the end it turned out, it was us, all along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically: There is a cron job which reads data from service directory and from Artifactory, compares the two and then generates access permissions and other configuration in the Artifactory database for the application.
This enables you to access the artifacts you depend on, based on what is declared in SD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throttling this cron job immediately brought relief and relaxed the load even further, but slowed down the import of changes from SD into Artifactory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lessons learned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always use distinct users for distinct applications (one per application, per cron job and so on).
Even if these have the same rights and access the same tables, it will make identifying the software component that is responsible for a thing much easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While Artifactory cannot understand Replicas and only ever works with the primary database, our own components around this are not limited by that restriction.
This script could read from any replica and then write back only the necessary changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This script is surely generating a lot of load for what it does, and needs some love and refactoring.
It is now on somebody&amp;rsquo;s backlog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;bad-queries-from-nowhere&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#bad-queries-from-nowhere&#34;&gt;
	Bad Queries from Nowhere?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad queries we optimized in Part 1 are still there and looking at what they actually do, they do not look particularly useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/09/artifactory-07.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multiple instances of a reporting query running in parallel. Even optimized they seem to be wasteful. We want to know where they come from.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the queries themselves, we see this SQL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;SUM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;bin_length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;nodes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;node_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;lt;reponame&amp;gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a reporting query that calculates the cumulative size of all things in one repo in our Artifactory.
Now that it is fast we can see, it arrives in 15s intervals, and from each of our Artifactory application instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that the query string is being generated from the actual Artifactory binary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can in fact download the Artifactory Java sourcecode and throw it into IntelliJ, and then hunt for this.
We even find something, because the query string is thankfully embedded literally in a DAO class, and not generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make a long search and a number of support conversations short:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These queries can&amp;rsquo;t be fast, but they can be faster than originally thought, thanks to covering indexes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of that, there is a cache in Artifactory for this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clearly, as shown by the recurring 15s appearance of the queries, the cache does not work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turns out, it does work for Artifactory work, but if you turn on JMX monitoring, the JMX will circumvent the cache and get you fresh values at high cost, for each Artifactory application instance, from the only database that we have, at the Prometheus scraping interval of 15s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turning off monitoring for this component removed this source of workload.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is undocumented in Artifactory, and was also not immediately obvious to their support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The query shown above is just one instance of multiple queries with similar characteristics and cost.
To properly estimate the impact, multiply the effect by 3-4, and then by the number of application instances connected to the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;so-are-we-good-now&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#so-are-we-good-now&#34;&gt;
	So are we good now?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the database point of view, this is as good as it gets.
The database is not currently a stability item or scalability limit, the current config could even be scaled back to a cheap standard Blade.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MySQL: Straight lines</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/09/08/mysql-straight-lines.html</link>

      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/09/08/mysql-straight-lines.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A database is showing replication delay, and so are all the other instances of the same replication hierarchy, all of which reside in Openstack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/09/straight-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shortly before 21:30 the database begins to lag, until around 23:45, when it starts to catch up, slowly. After 00:30, we gain delay again, plateau and then around 01:45, we catch up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The database is moving deep into replication delay sometimes.
It does not do that on bare metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;ground-truth&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#ground-truth&#34;&gt;
	Ground Truth
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VM is a nice hardware blade simulation, 16C/32T, 128 GB of memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data is on persistent volume backed by Ceph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; df -Th /mysql/&amp;lt;hierarchyname&amp;gt;/

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;0       /mysql/&amp;lt;hierarchyname&amp;gt;/tmp
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This database does not fit into the buffer pools:
The working set is too large.
We see read traffic in a warmed up database, at a rate of several dozen MB/s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checking in on &lt;code&gt;information_schema.tables&lt;/code&gt;, the two largest tables of this database are around 200 GB in size, each.
They seem to be accessed in full, there is little or no exploitable locality of reference.
So in order to quench these reads, we would need to supply three times the memory, 384 GB.
Since we can&amp;rsquo;t, we need to handle the I/O instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at the I/O:
When you run iostat, use &lt;code&gt;iostat -x -k 10&lt;/code&gt;, and discard the first output.
It contains the data collected since system boot, a very large average interval.
We want a clean 10s sample instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paste:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;Device            r/s     w/s     rMB/s     wMB/s   rrqm/s   wrqm/s  %rrqm  %wrqm r_await w_await aqu-sz rareq-sz wareq-sz  svctm  %util

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We see the busy drive being sdc, the persistent volume.
We see increased service times (&lt;code&gt;r_await&lt;/code&gt;, unit ms), and queues (&lt;code&gt;aqu-sz&lt;/code&gt;, unit is &amp;ldquo;average number of requests in  queue, during the observation interval&amp;rdquo;, which is 10s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also see around 4300 read requests/s and 67 MB/s read traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some previous experience in other projects suggests that a crucial piece of information may be missing.
This replication chain is no longer on bare metal, but is running on Openstack.
All traffic to disk in Openstack is quota-ed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any I/O problem on Openstack is undebuggable, unless you know the Quota affecting you.
Indeed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have an allowance for a maximum of 200 MB/s and a maximum of 3000 IOPS.
Measured in the system we see an ok bandwidth of 67 MB/s, but the IOPS hit the roof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we zoom in on a phase of replication delay in the Single Instance Info Panelof our grafana, we get to the bottom of that straight away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replication delay interval:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/09/straight-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/09/straight-02.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we have replication delay, we see a straight line in the sum of dm-reads for 70-ish MB/s.
This is well below quota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the IOPS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/09/straight-03.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the sum of all dm-Reads, and we only are interested in the reads for our device.
But we do see a straight line, and that suggests some kind of limit or resource exhaustion.
Also, the line is at around 4000 read/s versus a Quota of 3000 IOPS.
Together that suggest we run into resource depletion in the IOPS dept here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that bad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/09/straight-04.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The observed statement latency for the production user goes up from a minimum 348 ms to a max of 37100 ms (37.1s).
That is approximately 100x worse than normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The observed statement latency is also jumping rapidly up and down.
System performance is not only bad, but also wildly unpredictable, with high frequency swings across a wide corridor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is often indicative of a token bucket quota mechanism getting into resonance with the evaluation cycle of the token bucket itself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load is running away and then then Quota eval check cycle comes and bites down hard on the system over quota, essentially halting it.
The system stops, because a database without I/O is doing nothing.
It then accumulates new performance tokens in the token bucket, and in the next cycle executes, immediately draining the token pool and running over Quota.
Then the cycle repeats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it is less noisy if the quota is applied with &lt;code&gt;consumer=backend&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All expectations the user may have on performance are broken and the system may as well be offline.
Also, the variance in performance may create input signal spikes dependent systems, affecting their performance if there is resonance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without being aware of Quota limits and checking for them this is nearly undebuggable, and sometimes you may be looking at secondary effects downstream from the affected system.
With proper metrics and knowledge of the Quota it is plain obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;be-wary-of-straight-lines-in-performance-graphs&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#be-wary-of-straight-lines-in-performance-graphs&#34;&gt;
	Be wary of straight lines in performance graphs
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load is spiky, straight lines do not exist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a general truth for our systems:
In general our load is spiky.
It has peaks and valleys, and there are no plateaus or straight lines (outside of Kafka and other Queues and the systems fed by them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, if you see a straight line, I see a resource being exhausted and limiting system performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the exhausted resource is IOPS quota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other cases in the past, a straight line in dirty buffer pool pages graph was signaling exhaustion of the redo log space, or similar performance choke points.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MySQL: YOLO mode</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/09/02/mysql-yolo-mode.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2022 12:13:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/09/02/mysql-yolo-mode.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;OH:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And now let&amp;rsquo;s quickly push 2 billion rows into this database VM.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is best done in YOLO mode.
This is a mode of operation for a database that minimizes disk writes in favor of batched bulk writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not ACID, so if anything goes wrong during the load, the instance is lost.
That is why it is called YOLO mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are supposed to do this on a spare replica and not the production primary.
If you are not having at least one more replica than needed in your MySQL deployment, I consider your setup defective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;disable-flush-on-commit&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#disable-flush-on-commit&#34;&gt;
	Disable flush on Commit
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;set global innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;This config variable&lt;/a&gt;

 gives up ACID commits:
On COMMIT, data is written to the file system buffer cache, but an &lt;em&gt;fdatasync(2)&lt;/em&gt; is not enforced.
Instead, data is synced once per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;disable-the-doublewrite-buffer&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#disable-the-doublewrite-buffer&#34;&gt;
	Disable the Doublewrite Buffer
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;set global innodb_doublewrite = OFF;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_doublewrite&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;This config variable&lt;/a&gt;

 disables the InnoDB DoubleWrite Buffer.
This buffer stores a temporary copy of the full page, which consists of multiple disk blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be permanently turned off on file systems that never overwrite data and do not do in-plance updates (btrfs, ZFS), but not on traditional filesystems (XFS, ext4).
It can be permanently turned off on systems where the page size is equal to the guaranteed atomic write block size of the hardware (ie 4 KB page size and Enterprise drives that guarantee atomic block writes of 4 KB blocks, even on power loss).
That is, normal setups need this enabled all of the time, or risk torn pages (partially new and partially old pages) on power loss during page write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;unlogged-instance&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#unlogged-instance&#34;&gt;
	Unlogged instance
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users of Oracle MYSQL 8.0.21 or newer can have &amp;ldquo;redo log turned off&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;doublewrite buffer turned off&amp;rdquo; with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-redo-log.html#innodb-disable-redo-logging&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;single command&lt;/a&gt;

:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;alter instance disable innodb redo_log;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This replaces the preceding two config changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The redo log will never be written in the first place, so the flush log setting is pointless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The doublewrite buffer is not written.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;turn-off-the-binlog&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#turn-off-the-binlog&#34;&gt;
	Turn off the Binlog
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MySQL will still write a binlog.
Especially, MySQL 8 always has the binlog on by default.
You may want to turn it off per session:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;set sql_log_bin = off;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will kill another source of disk writes and potential disk syncs during the load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;delay-secondary-index-generation&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#delay-secondary-index-generation&#34;&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Delay secondary index generation&amp;rdquo;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;mysqldump&lt;/code&gt; will still generate a statement that tries to disable secondary index generation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;alter table t disable keys;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This command is accepted, but it only works in MyISAM, which nobody should use any more in 2022.
You can&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;set autocommit = 0;
set unique_checks = 0;
set foreign_key_checks = 0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to YOLO the loading of InnoDB tables, but very large transactions can have their own challenges in MySQL.
So best you commit every 1.000 to 10.000 rows loaded.
Make sure no transaction is ever larger than 1 GB, it will break compressed binlogs, if enabled.
When using group replication, transaction sizes need to be controlled even tighter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-meaning-of-yolo&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-meaning-of-yolo&#34;&gt;
	The meaning of YOLO
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is called YOLO mode for a reason.
Undo all these things after the load completes.
Then check that they are undone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only do this on scratch instances, which you can afford to lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means, this should be a replica that you disconnect for a data load, and that on success you can use as a source for &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/clone-plugin.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CLONE&lt;/a&gt;

.
On failure, you must be able to afford scrapping it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are running MySQL and are ever short on replicas you are holding it wrong.
Don&amp;rsquo;t complain to me, fix your process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MySQL: Boiling JFrogs</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/08/25/mysql-boiling-jfrogs.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Aug 2022 11:13:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/08/25/mysql-boiling-jfrogs.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A work problem:
A commercial application, Artifactory, where we do not control the source or the schema has performance problems involving a certain long running query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data size and row counts are not outrageous, and the query itself and the schema are not broken.
But the data is very skewed and for certain values the query is very slow, as almost the entire table is selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We introduce an experimental covering index, and show a 16x improvement, going from 143s to 9s execution time.
We advise the customer to ask for this covering index to be added officially using the normal way through MySQL portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;here-we-go&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#here-we-go&#34;&gt;
	Here we go
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A call to DBA:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve been investigating performance issues on the Artifactory side and found that our current MySQL primary is sitting at 80-90% I/O utilization.
Our next steps would be to see if there is any slow queries without indices or anything else unusual going on from the 3rd party application that we could potentially fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would I get the required access to have a look or is there already data collection in regards to this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are running SolarWinds DPM nee Vividcortex, so the easy way out is to point the customer at the SolarWinds access form and wish them luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead we go and have a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-situation-on-the-ground&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-situation-on-the-ground&#34;&gt;
	The situation on the ground
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artifactory is a product by a company called JFrogs.
It stores the output of CI pipelines and serves images for all kinds of backends.
For us, mostly Docker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The replication hierarchy is present in two AZs, and is comprised of standard bare metal blades.
That translates into 16C/32T, 128 GB RAM and 2 TB of local disk.
A quick hop onto the box shows a load of 22+, which is very high.
We see around 10k-15k SELECT/s, which is unusual for a primary in our database landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data directory has a total size of some 400 GB, and the Resident Set Size of the &lt;code&gt;mysqld&lt;/code&gt; is aroudn 100 GB, fully grown.
That is pretty large for such a small database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see a low read load, so the Working Set Size (WSS) still fits into the InnoDB Buffer Pool.
The write load is rather high (hundreds of writes per second, spiking into several thousands), which is very weird for a thing that is supposed to be a metadata store for images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The replica pool is completely idle:
We see the write load being replicated, but there are no client connections outside the monitoring.
Artifactory is an external product and it knows nothing about replication.
It does not split read and write handles, and so all of its traffic hits the primary and only the primary.
It does not scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, we also had tables without primary keys in their schema, which is a big issue for scalability for other reasons.
Generally the product claims to be database product agnostic, which among DBA folk is a sure signal for badly optimized schemas and worse scalability.
Being a &amp;ldquo;database agnostic&amp;rdquo; Java application, I expect UUIDv4 primary keys, bad Hibernate generated queries and toil from a tangle of foreign key constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;whats-visible&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#whats-visible&#34;&gt;
	What&amp;rsquo;s visible
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a bunch of tooling running in our environment that can give you an idea what the box is doing, and what is observed to be slow.
Most of that has a latency, and a history, but I want to see what is happening now, and I want to see it in full fidelity, without aggregations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I hop on the box and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;information_schema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;processlist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;query&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;G&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here I am asking &lt;code&gt;I_S.PROCESSLIST&lt;/code&gt; what is currently running and takes longer than 10 seconds.
I find six instances of a query, five of them a reporting query on the total size of what later turns out to be a folder (&amp;ldquo;sum query&amp;rdquo;) and one of it a reporting query over a set of files and folders (&amp;ldquo;folder query&amp;rdquo;).
Both are running on the same table, &lt;code&gt;nodes&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at the ground truth some more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;tables-and-sizes&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#tables-and-sizes&#34;&gt;
	Tables and Sizes
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we are going to dive into the single repeated slow query seen above, we want to know more about the database size and statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;and that&amp;rsquo;s a total of 243 GB for the largest table, and some 41 GB for our friend, the &lt;code&gt;nodes&lt;/code&gt; table, the second largest table in our database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tables-of-log-nature&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#tables-of-log-nature&#34;&gt;
	Tables of Log-nature
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest table, &lt;code&gt;indexed_archives_entries&lt;/code&gt;, is not our problem today.
But the size and the name suggest a thing that happens so often that it is worthwhile mentioning anyway:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all transactional applications have tables that are log-natured.
Their primary key has a time or counter component, or they are partitioned on time.
With all load factors of the system staying the same, just by waiting, these tables will grow without bounds, because they are logs.
If you do not complete the data lifecycle for these structures, they will eventually eat the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, such tables need to be pruned.
They are a data warehouse inside your transactional system that struggles to get out.
So you either ETL these records into a data warehouse in a regular export.
Or you forego this entirely, put a change even onto a Kafka bus or a syslog, and let another component that is not serving user facing transactional traffic pick it up and aggregate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, everybody has these tables, and everybody eventually needs to come clean about them, or die from bloat. (looking at you OpenStack)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-nodes-table&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-nodes-table&#34;&gt;
	The nodes table
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;nodes&lt;/code&gt; table looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;nodes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;G&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The index used from the plan below is &lt;code&gt;nodes_repo_path_name_idx&lt;/code&gt;, which has a prefix of &lt;code&gt;repo&lt;/code&gt; being used.
&lt;code&gt;repo&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;varchar(64) charset utf8mb3&lt;/code&gt; worth up to 194 bytes including length counter overhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, I know nothing about Artifactory at all, but this reads to me like a non-critical query for the baseline functionality of Artifactory.
It also looks like something that can and should be cached somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unclear to me and the customer if that query is coming from actual Artifactory or some external monitoring added to it, but it is rather obvious that a rather large part of the load we see is coming from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For good measure, here are the table stats:&lt;/p&gt;

and the table size is not outrageous.
But we see around 26 MRows in total, and from the plan 13 MRows being considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this looks like a data problem, not a problem with the SQL or the plan.
We have bad selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

	Selectivity matters (This is a data bug)
    &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;261&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;rows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the column &lt;code&gt;repo&lt;/code&gt; has 261 different values for 26 MRows.
But the distribution of values is very uneven.
240 values or so have each fewer than 100 KRows (many have fewer than 100) and the value &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;docker&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; is seen 12M times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is stored in pages of 16 KB, and we get to see an average row length of slightly under 1K in the output further above.
That means we see 16 or more rows per block.
But 1/2 of all rows are values &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;docker&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, so when we ask questions related to &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;repo=&#39;docker&#39;&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, we select 50% all rows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming equidistribution and no clustering that means we are loading all pages of this table and have to go through them.
For this value of &lt;code&gt;repo&lt;/code&gt; the index is useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You query is fine, but your data is bad, mate.&amp;rdquo; is something nobody wants to hear.
But selectivity matters:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#a-better-index-for-bad-data&#34;&gt;
	A better index for bad data
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To resolve the query&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;bin_length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;nodes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;node_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;docker&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;using an index on repo, the database will go into the secondary index and select all rows with &lt;code&gt;repo=&amp;quot;docker&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;.
It needs to narrow this list down to values that are also have &lt;code&gt;node_type=1&lt;/code&gt;, manually, because the index chosen as per &lt;code&gt;EXPLAIN&lt;/code&gt; does not have this information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will find the primary key of each row in the index, and then go to the primary key.
Here it will select all rows found, to get the value for &lt;code&gt;bin_length&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will then sum up these numbers to come up with the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a bunch on index reads on the secondary index, and then using the cleaned up of primary key values from the index to fetch the actual data.
On rotating disk, it would also involve around 13M disk seeks (at 5ms, so 200 seeks/second), so the query would run for ages (or things are cached very well in memory).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we can do better, even in a bad situation such as this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could either&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;ALTER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;nodes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;ADD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;INDEX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;node_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;bin_length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;or the equivalent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;ALTER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;nodes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;ADD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;INDEX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;node_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;bin_length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either will satisfy the (commutative) &lt;code&gt;AND&lt;/code&gt; condition from our sum query. But we also have the folder query to consider, which is also slow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;GROUP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This groups by &lt;code&gt;repo&lt;/code&gt; and otherwise uses the same columns.
As it groups by &lt;code&gt;repo&lt;/code&gt; it can only profit from an index that has &lt;code&gt;repo&lt;/code&gt; as the prefix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We choose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;ALTER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;nodes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;ADD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;INDEX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;node_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;bin_length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;as an index that can serve both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;covering-indexes-or-why-this-is-fast&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#covering-indexes-or-why-this-is-fast&#34;&gt;
	Covering indexes (or why this is fast)
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running the sum query against this index will dive into the secondary index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the index, we select all rows matching &lt;code&gt;repo&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;node_type&lt;/code&gt;.
We also forced &lt;code&gt;bin_length&lt;/code&gt; into this index, but it is not used in selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s there, as well as the invisible pointer to the full row (the primary key, &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;).
The optimizer knows that, and can use it: It uses the &lt;code&gt;bin_length&lt;/code&gt; from the index, no need to go to the full row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effectively we select a subtree from the index, incidentally also find the data we need to sum up, and serve that back.
We can do this without having to go back to the primary key, critically saving abunch of seek operations (on rotating disk) and data page access (everywhere).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This speeds up query execution from 140-ish seconds to 4s-9s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we have a bunch of replicas for resilience, even if Artifactory cannot use them, I might as well use them for experimentation.
Running the docker query on the cold (on the replica) cache takes 6m10s.
After cache warmup, it takes 2m15.
After the index juggling (which takes 3m6s) the query resolves in 9s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a 16x speedup.&lt;/p&gt;

	Ohai, MDL!
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our experimentation we found that an additional index can speed some critical queries.
Adding the index on a production replica worked, taking 3 minutes and yielded a speedup of 16x.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to put this index into production failed:
Plenty of slow sum queries pile up with &amp;ldquo;waiting on metadata lock&amp;rdquo;.
Checking on the &lt;code&gt;ALTER&lt;/code&gt;, we find it is also waiting on the metadata lock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not checked the source, but I am assuming the MDL protects the table definition.
A running query takes a share lock (S-Lock) on the MDL to make sure the table does not change shape while the query is running.
An &lt;code&gt;ALTER&lt;/code&gt; takes out an exclusive lock (X-Lock) on the MDL to make sure it is alone while the shape of the table changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In MySQL, X-Locks usually have precedence over S-Locks, so asking for an X-Lock will stall all requests for S-Lock.
That means starting the &lt;code&gt;ALTER&lt;/code&gt; was responsible for all the stalled queries on &lt;code&gt;nodes&lt;/code&gt; in &amp;ldquo;waiting for metadata lock&amp;rdquo; state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why was the &lt;code&gt;ALTER&lt;/code&gt; itself stalled?
While X-Locks have precedence over S-Locks, breaking locks that have already been granted is Not A Thing.
So the &lt;code&gt;ALTER&lt;/code&gt; has to wait for all the existing S-Locks being held on &lt;code&gt;nodes&lt;/code&gt; to go away before it can start.
The queries running are slow queries, though, running for around 2 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; have to wait two minutes for the &lt;code&gt;ALTER&lt;/code&gt; to start and then another three minutes for it to complete, I presume.
Unfortunately, a 5m to 7m wait piles up so many queries that we would run out of connection, and also our developers using Artifactory would hate on us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I have to terminate the &lt;code&gt;ALTER&lt;/code&gt; and we choose another approach:
Change all replicas, fail the application to a replica that is being promoted to primary, and then fix the ex-primary left behind (or simply let the automation reclone it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;latency-matters&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#latency-matters&#34;&gt;
	Latency matters
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do this, and we find that Artifactory shows a very much changed behavior:
Write levels are around 10x lower, and disk I/O &amp;ldquo;util%&amp;rdquo; drops dramatically, but also the load balancer metrics look a lot more precarious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learn that for the application team a switchover means a switchover of the database.
The Artifactory application remains running in the Netherlands, but the database it talks to is now 10ms away in England.
Obviously, this kind of communication latency affects application performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After making changes, we fail back.
Both Artifactory and its database are now in the Netherlands, and we get a 10x higher write rate, stable load balancer latencies and again a critically high disk saturation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disk-writes-why&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#disk-writes-why&#34;&gt;
	Disk Writes, why?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, not critically high.
It turns out that &amp;ldquo;util%&amp;rdquo; is not a good metric at all, and also that &lt;code&gt;dm-7&lt;/code&gt; or other device mapper metrics are often fishy.
Looking at completion latency statistics from &lt;code&gt;sda&lt;/code&gt; shows we move up around 10% with plenty of headroom, so we are actually fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question remains:
Why does an application serving docker image metadata write to disk so much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it&amp;rsquo;s writes and we archive them in binlog.
So, let&amp;rsquo;s ghetto some table write stats from a row based replication binlog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt;/*/logs
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt;# mysqlbinlog -vvv binlog.... | awk &amp;#39;/^### UPDATE/ { print $3 }&amp;#39; | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt;...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt; 112615 `artdb`.`nodes`
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt; 610088 `artdb`.`md_pkg_stats`
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt; 610088 `artdb`.`md_ver_stats`

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uh, yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are turning every image read into a stats write, you have a lot of writes and you don&amp;rsquo;t scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe don&amp;rsquo;t log to the production database monolith, but Kafka or syslog stats out, and collect them elsewhere?
It&amp;rsquo;s 2022, after all&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We already know from other research that &lt;code&gt;node_type=1&lt;/code&gt; is not very selective.
It indicates directories (0) and files (1).
The negations are also not good at increasing selectivity and indexing on negations is&amp;hellip; fraught with problems.
That leaves us with &lt;code&gt;nodes.node_name&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is wrapped into a function, &lt;code&gt;lower()&lt;/code&gt;.
This function turns the values in the column into lower case for comparison with a string constant with a wildcard in a like (essentially almost a &lt;code&gt;BETWEEN &#39;tax&#39; AND &#39;tay&#39;&lt;/code&gt;, except that &lt;code&gt;BETWEEN&lt;/code&gt; is inclusive and &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; is not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in database gnostic SQL one would drop the &lt;code&gt;lower()&lt;/code&gt; since your default collation is &lt;code&gt;_ci&lt;/code&gt; (case insensitive) and &lt;code&gt;_ai&lt;/code&gt; (accent insensitive) anyway.
It serves no function in MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all other databases, you&amp;rsquo;d &lt;code&gt;lower()&lt;/code&gt; in Java and write normalized data into the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it matters not, we have functional indexes, so instead of indexing &lt;code&gt;nodes.node_name&lt;/code&gt; we just index &lt;code&gt;lower(nodes.node_name)&lt;/code&gt; instead.
That changes nothing for MySQL at all, but the optimizer requires this data duplication in order to see the possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Percona discusses &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.percona.com/blog/mysql-8-0-functional-indexes/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MySQL 8 Functional Indexes&lt;/a&gt;

 in their blog, and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-index.html#create-index-functional-key-parts&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;manual&lt;/a&gt;

	Summary
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We run into a database load problem that turns out not to be a size-related or query-related problem at all, but a good case for covering indexes.
Covering indexes are a powerful tool to speed up certain kind of reporting queries that otherwise accumulate a lot of run time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also get a glimpse at the data structures in Artifactory, which look a lot better than most DBAs would expect from previous encounters with Hibernate using Java products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still the product can benefit a lot from a very modest investment in access modernization (split read and write handles) and segregation of transactional and reporting/log-natured data (cut out log writes, cut out log tables and complete the data lifecycle), which would help it scale to survive in a large Enterprise environment.
Do not weigh down your transactional database with evergrowing log writes, and also do not turn every customer read into a write into your transactional database monolith.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MySQL: GIPK (InnoDB and Primary Keys)</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/08/23/mysql-gipk.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 23 Aug 2022 08:39:21 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/08/23/mysql-gipk.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The MySQL InnoDB storage engine lives off primary keys:
Records are stored physically in a B+-Tree, a balanced tree where the data pages are the leaves of the primary key B-Tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That implies that the data is stored physically in primary key order – records with similar primary keys are usually physically closer together than records with larger differences in primary key value.
In literature, such physically ordered indexes are often called clustered indexes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;innodb-depends-on-primary-keys&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#innodb-depends-on-primary-keys&#34;&gt;
	InnoDB depends on primary keys
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondary indexes in databases need to store the indexed data together with a row address, a pointer to the full row (in InnoDB, into the primary key).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that row address was a physical address (a disk block number or a similar pointer tied to the position of the data), growing data pages and moving them around would often also make it necessary to update all secondary indexes.
For example when a page is split or records move around for other reasons, the physical position of a page changes and all references to that page in SKs would also need an update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using the primary key value as a pointer to the full row, InnoDB achieves several things, good and bad:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The primary key is added as an (invisible) suffix to every SK. If you have a large PK, you are adding a lot of bytes to every SK. Keep PK values short.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The optimizer can leverage the PK at the end of the SK. Some queries are unexpectedly &amp;ldquo;covering&amp;rdquo;: &lt;code&gt;SELECT id FROM t WHERE a = 10&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;using index&lt;/code&gt; for a table &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; that has an &lt;code&gt;INDEX(a)&lt;/code&gt;, because internally it is &lt;code&gt;INDEX(a, id)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondary Index lookups are taking exactly 2x as much time as a primary key lookup, because we do a lookup in the SK, and then using the PK value found, we dive into the PK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes to the primary key, for example inserts into the middle of the table, are localized: Page splits happen internally in the primary key, but are not exposed to any SK. So while lookups to an SK cost more, SKs need a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; fewer updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes to any primary key value (&lt;code&gt;UPDATE t SET id = -id WHERE id = 10&lt;/code&gt;) are fantastically expensive: The record is physically moved around in the PK, and all SK need changes, too. This can trigger a cascade of page splits and merges. Treat PK values as immutable, non-reusable tokens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because InnoDB has this clustered index as the PK, it is completely dependent on the primary key being present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you define a table without a primary key, InnoDB tries to secretly promote any other index that is suitable to primary key.
Since the primary key is a non-nullable unique index that happens to be named &lt;code&gt;PRIMARY&lt;/code&gt; in InnoDB, any other non-nullable unique index would be suitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If even that is absent, InnoDB starts to make up a primary key.
For that, a global counter exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is shared between &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; tables that have no primary key.
This counter is protected by a mutex, and if you have insert heavy tables without a primary key, you can end up having contention of this mutex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently this is common knowledge since 2013, as documented by &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jcole.us/2013/05/02/how-does-innodb-behave-without-a-primary-key/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Jeremy Cole&lt;/a&gt;

 and by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.percona.com/blog/2013/10/18/innodb-scalability-issues-tables-without-primary-keys/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Percona&lt;/a&gt;

, but I did not know this (that the counter is globally shared).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;replication-depends-on-primary-keys&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#replication-depends-on-primary-keys&#34;&gt;
	Replication depends on Primary Keys
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other important subsystems also depend on primary keys:
For example, all modern replication absolutely requires primary keys to function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Row Based Replication, row changes are communicated to the replica as row change events.
These contain at minimum the primary key of the row change (or the entire old row, if there is no primary key), and the new value of all changed columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the replica must apply this.
In the absence of any primary key, the row to change in the replica is found using a full table scan.
And that does not scale for obvious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, do you ask, is that a problem, if InnoDB always has to have a primary key?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this autogenerated, internal, global primary key is not exposed in the binlog, and is local to an instance.
The replica does not see it, and if it saw it, could not use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse, Group Replication will simply not work without primary key at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;so-make-primary-keys-mandatory&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#so-make-primary-keys-mandatory&#34;&gt;
	So make primary keys mandatory
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 8.0.13 we can make an explicit primary key mandatory in MySQL.
For that, we need to set &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_sql_require_primary_key&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sql_require_primary_key&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

.
If that is set, any table creation without a primary key present is rejected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;alter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;primary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;auto_increment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But of course, this can break badly written SQL:
Anything that does a &lt;code&gt;SELECT *&lt;/code&gt;, or otherwise depends on column count, position or order will break.
We would need a mechanism to add a primary key column that is not there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 8.0.23, we can have &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/invisible-columns.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;invisible columns&lt;/a&gt;

.
They allow us to add an &lt;code&gt;auto_increment&lt;/code&gt; to an existing table without primary key, without breaking badly written SQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We define a table &lt;code&gt;scooby&lt;/code&gt; with a hidden primary key.
When we insert data int this table, this just works normally, and &lt;code&gt;auto_increment&lt;/code&gt; supplies the primary key value automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we look at the data using &lt;code&gt;select *&lt;/code&gt;, the hidden column is not shown.
When we ask for it explicitly, it is there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;automating-this-gipk&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#automating-this-gipk&#34;&gt;
	Automating this: GIPK
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning with 8.0.30, we get automation for this:
We could &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-table-gipks.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Generate Invisible Primary Keys&lt;/a&gt;

, or GIPK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is of course a fix for broken designs.
You should never need this for your own schemas.
Simply go back to the source and fix that instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you happen to run JAMF or other software that you do not control and that insists on PK-less tables, you can now have it autofixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you set &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_sql_generate_invisible_primary_key&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;sql_generate_invisible_primary_key&lt;/a&gt;

, and try to create a table without a primary key, a &lt;code&gt;my_row_id bigint unsigned not null auto_increment invisible&lt;/code&gt; primary key is added for you to the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;variables&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;like&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;%primary%&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#bad-naming-choices-but-good-protection&#34;&gt;
	Bad naming choices, but good protection
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The naming of that primary is bad, of course, because MySQL here takes arbitrary names out of a public namespace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be much better if MySQL reserved the prefix &lt;code&gt;__&lt;/code&gt; (underbar underbar) in all namespaces for itself, and for example generated &lt;code&gt;__id&lt;/code&gt; here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The self-documentingly named variable &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_show_gipk_in_create_table_and_information_schema&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;show_gipk_in_create_table_and_information_schema&lt;/a&gt;

 controls this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When set to &lt;code&gt;off&lt;/code&gt;, invisible columns are also no longer shown there.
That should be even less necessary, and only very broken ORMs should need this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;good-primary-keys&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#good-primary-keys&#34;&gt;
	Good primary keys
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should never need any of this.
You should define an explicit primary key for all your tables.
If they are missing and you control application source and schema, you can fix this at the source instead of using this kludge.
Go back and fix things properly instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every Table in MySQL Always Must Have a Primary Key
When you are creating or altering a table in MySQL, make sure you have a primary key defined.
We also advise you to never change a primary key value once it is set, and to never re-use a primary key value once a record is deleted.
We advise you to keep the primary key short, below 16 or 32 bytes in size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/04/15/sql-engineering-guidelines.html&#34;&gt;SQL Engineering Guide&lt;/a&gt;


for a discussion of this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good primary key is short, less than 32 bytes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good primary key is immutable and never re-used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good primary key is an &lt;code&gt;auto_increment&lt;/code&gt; value, or a UUIDv1 that is stored in a &lt;code&gt;BINARY(16)&lt;/code&gt; that is being accessed with &lt;code&gt;UUID_TO_BIN(...,1)&lt;/code&gt; (the swap flag is set to true).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Java generated UUIDv4 is a random number and has horrible performance properties for InnoDB.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The topic of UUID is covered at length in &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/04/06/mysql-and-uuids.html&#34;&gt;MySQL and UUIDs&lt;/a&gt;

  and in &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/09/22/alter-table-for-uuid.html&#34;&gt;ALTER TABLE for UUID&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;auto_increment&lt;/code&gt; is not slow. MySQL keeps an &lt;code&gt;auto_increment&lt;/code&gt; counter per table, and assigns values to each thread that inserts data in batches to limit contention on the counter. This is automatic and highly efficient.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That has the side-effect that there may be gaps in the &lt;code&gt;auto_increment&lt;/code&gt; sequence, and values are not always assigned in a strict temporal order. The manual &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-auto-increment-handling.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;has a discussion&lt;/a&gt;

 of this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;tldr&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#tldr&#34;&gt;
	TL;DR
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MySQL 8.0.30 adds GIPK, generated invisible primary keys.
They should only ever be needed if you have external software running where you cannot control and fix the schema, but they would allow you to run such software with RBR or GR without cooperation from the vendor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GIPK is correctly implemented with respect to name clashes and dropping required primary keys.
The column naming choice has the potential to clash with existing names and sits right there in the public namespace, which is a bit jarring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a feature that is never needed unless you absolutely need it to get something broken running in a modern MySQL environment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MySQL: Row Literals</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/08/22/mysql-row-literals.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2022 08:39:21 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/08/22/mysql-row-literals.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Question on the Libera/#mysql IRC channel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to split a simple select into multiple returned rows?
For example, &lt;code&gt;select 1, 2, 3&lt;/code&gt; to be returned as rows?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually asking for a table literal notation.
I know of four ways to construct a table literal in MySQL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;union-all&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#union-all&#34;&gt;
	UNION ALL
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oldest way to construct a table literal in any SQL that supports &lt;code&gt;UNION&lt;/code&gt; is the &lt;code&gt;UNION ALL&lt;/code&gt; construct.
Write &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; statements to return literal rows, and add them together to a table using &lt;code&gt;UNION ALL&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-mysql&#34; data-lang=&#34;mysql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;union&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;union&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+---+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+---+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+---+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;rows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has always worked, even on the oldest versions of MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;json_table&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#json_table&#34;&gt;
	JSON_TABLE()
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is actually a function to turn a JSON expression into a result table, &lt;code&gt;JSON_TABLE()&lt;/code&gt;.
It is documented &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/json-table-functions.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;

.
The function exprects a JSON expression (or simply a literal JSON array in our case), and a JSON path expression with instructions on how to type and name the extracted values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-mysql&#34; data-lang=&#34;mysql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;json_table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;[{&amp;#34;i&amp;#34;: 1}, {&amp;#34;i&amp;#34;:2}, {&amp;#34;i&amp;#34;: 3} ]&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;$[*]&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;$.i&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+------+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;rows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;values-statement-and-row-function&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#values-statement-and-row-function&#34;&gt;
	&lt;code&gt;VALUES&lt;/code&gt; statement and &lt;code&gt;ROW()&lt;/code&gt; function
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MySQL introduces the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/values.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;VALUES&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

 statement and the &lt;code&gt;ROW()&lt;/code&gt; function.
&lt;code&gt;VALUES&lt;/code&gt; is a statement that returns a table constructed from literal values described with &lt;code&gt;ROW()&lt;/code&gt; functions.
So in order to get the table for further processing, we need a subselect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-mysql&#34; data-lang=&#34;mysql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;with-and-values&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#with-and-values&#34;&gt;
	&lt;code&gt;WITH&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;VALUES&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can do the same, but use a Common Table Expression instead of a subselect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-mysql&#34; data-lang=&#34;mysql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

      <title>Good Energy News</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/08/15/good-energy-news.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/08/15/good-energy-news.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two good news in one day. First, my energy provider tells me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levert u meer terug dan u van het net afneemt, dan betalen we u vanaf die datum 16.8 eurocent per kWh.
De oude vergoeding was 7 eurocent per kWh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you push energy into the grid, we now pay you 16.8 Eurocent per kWh. The old payment was 7.0 Eurocent per kWh.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other good news is that it is very likely that the existing &amp;ldquo;Salderingsregeling&amp;rdquo; may be continued until 2025.
At least that seems to be the plan, says &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.milieucentraal.nl/energie-besparen/zonnepanelen/salderingsregeling-voor-zonnepanelen/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;milieu centraal&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Salderingsregeling&amp;rdquo; says that for power that I feed back into the grid I can draw back without cost.
You can imagine that as using the grid as a battery with infinite capacity, or as the counter going backwards.
There are a few limits and regulations, but more on that below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original plan was to end the Salderingsregeling at the End of &amp;lsquo;22.
This was then extended to the End of &amp;lsquo;23, and it seems that it is now being discussed to extend it to the End of &amp;lsquo;24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I am consuming 5000 kWh from the grid and push 2000 kWh into the grid, I will have to pay only 3000 kWh.
It does not matter that I actually withdrew 4000 kWh from the grid, because some consumption was at night, or because I overshot the production of my panels at a certain point in time.
Only the net Saldo matters, the difference between production and consumption over the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also works the other way around:
If I am producing 5000 kWh and consume only 2000 kWh from the grid, my Saldo will be 3000 kWh in my favor.
For that I am supposed to get a &amp;ldquo;reasonable compensation&amp;rdquo;, says the law.
At the same time the goverment made noises that basically said that &amp;ldquo;80% of the purchase price seem to be reasonable&amp;rdquo;.
Apparently this prompts my energy provider to make the above change, offering 75% of the purchase price to preempt regulation.
You know what, I am actually somewhat okay with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the entire specific regulation seems to be not fixed, yet, and the actual handling and pricing is still subject to change.
We will see how this will actually play out, but right now the change has been entirely pro consumer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also clear that we will not keep the Salderingsregeling ad infinitum.
The original plan was to gradually switch it from 100% Saldering to 9% less each year.
That still seems to be the case, so we expect to see this table to be implemented:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right&#34;&gt;2027&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right&#34;&gt;55%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right&#34;&gt;2028&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right&#34;&gt;46%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right&#34;&gt;2029&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right&#34;&gt;37%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right&#34;&gt;2030&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right&#34;&gt;28%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right&#34;&gt;2031+&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right&#34;&gt;0%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of a gradual decline we see a big initial jump from 100% to 64%.
That&amp;rsquo;s because the original plan was to decrease by 9% starting 2022, and while the end deadline was kept, the initial full Saldering was kept alive for several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time the government says it expects a reasonable compensation for the other power that is no longer part of the Salderingsregeling, and that&amp;rsquo;s the above 80% (or now 75% number).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a bit unclear how that now will work out:
Will there be two kinds of tariff for power pushed to the grid that is part of the Saldering, and a second tariff for the other power that is not part of the Saldering, or one tariff for everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will see how that works out soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MacOS: How to prevent screen blanker</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/07/30/macos-how-to-prevent-screen-blanker.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 30 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/07/30/macos-how-to-prevent-screen-blanker.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When running Keynote, MacOS prevents the screen blanker from kicking in.
I needed a similar thing in one of my Python applications, so I needed to find out how it does that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out, there is an API for that:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsprocessinfo/1415995-beginactivitywithoptions&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;beginActivity:withOptions:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

,
which returns an Object token &lt;code&gt;activity&lt;/code&gt;.
Calling &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsprocessinfo/1411321-endactivity&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;endActivity&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;


with that Token ends the activity, and resumes the screen blanker countdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a list of activity options,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsactivityoptions&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;NSActivityOptions&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

.
We are interested into &lt;code&gt;NSActivityIdleDisplaySleepDisabled&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;NSActivityUserInteractive&lt;/code&gt;, mostly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interfacing with Objective-C in Python is possible through &lt;code&gt;ctypes&lt;/code&gt;, but that is work.
Work, it turns out, that has already been done in
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/minrk/appnope&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;appnope&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

,
specifically in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/minrk/appnope/blob/c97905ae5d2f5f2ce2fb65ce127a0e5c19ee2c50/appnope/_nope.py#L52-L73&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;_nope.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrating that into my PyQt application is trivial.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Energieverbrauch in Deutschland</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/07/03/energieverbrauch-in-deutschland.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/07/03/energieverbrauch-in-deutschland.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Der Wikipedia-Artikel zum Thema &lt;a href=&#34;https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energieverbrauch#Energieverbrauch_in_Deutschland&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Energieverbrauch&lt;/a&gt;

 ist wirklich interessant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schaut man sich zum Beispiel diese Grafik (oder die Tabelle, auf der sie basiert) an, dann sieht man:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/07/germany-primary-energy.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Primärenergieverbrauch Deutschland 1990 bis jetzt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wie man sieht, ist der Primärenergieverbrauch von Deutschland seit 1990 fast konstant geblieben.
Wikipedia schreibt im Detail: &amp;ldquo;Zwischen 1990 und 2011 nahm das reale Bruttoinlandprodukt um 34 % zu, der Energieverbrauch nahm jedoch um 9 % ab.&amp;rdquo;
Rechnet man um, sind es bummelt 14000 Petajoule, was circa 4000 TWh entspricht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private Haushalte nutzen &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/daten/private-haushalte-konsum/wohnen/energieverbrauch-privater-haushalte#hochster-anteil-am-energieverbrauch-zum-heizen&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;laut Umweltbundesamt&lt;/a&gt;

 circa 650 TWh, und davon sind etwa 450 TWh Heizenergie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Im Grunde genommen ergeben sich daraus sofort die folgenden Ideen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dächer voll machen:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 KWp Limit weg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anmeldung und Steuer vereinfachen, und Eigenverbrauch nicht besteuern.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solarinstallation fördern (statt 9000 Euro bei E-Autos dann lieber hier).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Akkus als Ausgleich fördern:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hausakku fördern (s.o. Solaranlage)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rückspeisefähigkeit bei E-Autos und deren Ladepunkten vorschreiben.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wärmepumpen fördern und vorschreiben.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selbst, wenn man bei den Wärmepumpen nur einen Workfaktor von 3 annnimmt, bekommt man die 450 TWh zum Heizen gedrittelt, also einen Strom-Mehrverbrauch von maximal 150 TWh und eine Einsparung von 300 TWh (zum Vergleich: Atomkraft liefert derzeit noch ca. 230 TWh).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Und: 15 kWh Hausakku entsprechen auch bei sehr großen Häusern 1-2 Tagen Autonomie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist wunderbar, denn Solar und Wind sind in Deutschland jahreszeitlich in etwa konstant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/07/germany-solar-und-wind.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Die Summe aus Solar und Wind ist in etwa konstant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lokale Energiespeicher dienen also in erster Linie dazu, die passende Glättung zu erzeugen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another Friday, another replication hierarchy lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-error-from-june-july-edition&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-error-from-june-july-edition&#34;&gt;
	The error from June, July edition?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The errors reported look awfully familiar: Binlog position is supposedly 4, and the error message has text about &amp;ldquo;max_allowed_packet&amp;rdquo;.
Could it be another instance of &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/06/07/mysql-binlog-compression-and-large-transactions.html&#34;&gt;this bug&lt;/a&gt;

 from early last month?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, one symptom was &amp;ldquo;a large binlog, larger than max_binlog_size&amp;rdquo;.
We check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;-rw-r----- 1 mysql mysql 1073794077 Jul  1 06:39 binlog.000914

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;-rw-r----- 1 mysql mysql 1073741881 Jul  1 09:28 binlog.000916
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;-rw-r----- 1 mysql mysql 2038358667 Jul  1 11:21 binlog.000917
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Log ends at 11:21, at twice the expected size.
Meh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;to-the-flight-recorder&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s check the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/04/22/a-mysql-flight-recorder.html&#34;&gt;flight recorder&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is it this time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; xz -dc 11_21.innodb.xz&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; less

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an &lt;code&gt;INSERT ... SELECT ...&lt;/code&gt;, generated from Percona Online Schema Change.
The transaction has some 2895 rows open, so in order for this to be a problem the average row length must be very large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s check:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;root@instance-1009 [schema]&amp;gt; show table status like &amp;#39;table&amp;#39;\G

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;      Collation: latin1_swedish_ci

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt; Create_options: row_format=DYNAMIC
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;        Comment:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;1 row in set (0.00 sec)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, so we have 3.3 MB row size, on the average (peak blob size is 6.7 MB or so).
Checking the schema shows us two &lt;code&gt;MEDIUMTEXT&lt;/code&gt; columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;analysis&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#analysis&#34;&gt;
	Analysis
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mitigation from &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/06/07/mysql-binlog-compression-and-large-transactions.html&#34;&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt;

 had not been implemented, yet.
It has now been escalated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event triggering the outage was a transaction larger than 1 GB, as before, in the face of binlog compression.
The program triggering the large transaction was a DBA maintenance job running Percona Online Schema Change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Percona Online Schema Change has no logic to prevent large transactions from occuring.
It should maybe check average row size, or check largest row size in the table, and cut smaller pieces so that the &lt;code&gt;INSERT ... SELECT&lt;/code&gt; it generates always stays below 1G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or it should accept that the &lt;code&gt;INSERT ... SELECT&lt;/code&gt; may fail, if &lt;code&gt;max_binlog_cache_size&lt;/code&gt; has been set, and retry with smaller steps then.
The second idea would be better, I believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the flight recorder has been invaluable in nailing down the root cause.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The new energy bill</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/06/28/the-new-energy-bill.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/06/28/the-new-energy-bill.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We got our solar roof around 1st of April.
I am describing our setup &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/05/02/a-solar-roof.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;

.
Today we got the bill for Summer 2021 to Summer 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-i-measured&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-i-measured&#34;&gt;
	What I measured
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I installed a P1 interface on my electricity counter late in April, so my data does not cover all of the lifetime of the Solar Roof.
Starting the graph at 01-Apr-2022, I get this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/06/bill-in-and-out.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At this resolution, not very helpful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is visible is the fact that we do not have a battery, and therefore each day we produce energy, but also consume energy from the grid.
What is not visible is the relation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/06/bill-counter.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the absolute counter values is more helpful.
The total production is on the right hand side, the consumption on the left hand side, and the important number is the Range value below the graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We produced 1.66 MWh during the range between 01-Apr and now. We consumed 279 kWh in that interval.
That leaves us with slightly under 1.5 MWh pushed to the grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/06/bill-gas-meter.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heating consumed around 10 m^3 in one evening, otherwise we use gas for warm water. Not a lot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We consumed 28.7 m^3 (around 287 kWh) of gas since the begin of metering.
This includes one day of runaway heating worth around 10 m^w, and the rest is warm water.
Warm water is not the cost driver, heating with gas is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let&amp;rsquo;s look at the financials:
We get back 561 Euro, because we paid 2297 Euro in 12 monthly installments, and used 1735 Euro worth of power and gas.
Mostly gas, but more on that further down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our monthly installment two years ago was 192 Euro, last year 202 Euro, and this year it will be 213 Euro.
Of these 213 Euro, 199 Euro will be for gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So already, without knowing details, we have our mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;get-off-gas-now&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#get-off-gas-now&#34;&gt;
	Get off Gas, now!
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is our electricity intake for the last 5 years:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/06/bill-electricity.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Down to 2.052 MW/a from 4.850 MW/a.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active since April 2022, the solar array has fed back sufficient electricity to compensate for more than half our consumption.
Do I believe in overprovisioning?
Well, yes, kind of.
The array has been built with future use-cases in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, in the last 12 months we used 3881 kWh, and pushed 1834 kWh back to the grid for the set consumption you see in the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/06/bill-gas.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Down to 1251 m^3 of gas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out gas consumption also fell, but that is mostly due to a mild winter and not heating much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;doing-the-math&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#doing-the-math&#34;&gt;
	Doing the math
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are paying around 22 ct per kWh of electricity, and while there is a bit of fixed cost, it hardly matters – 22.5 ct per kWh all in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas costs around 108 ct per m^3, which is an energy equivalent of 10-12 kWh warmth depending on the type of gas.
Fixed cost here is substantial, and we end up at 132 ct per m^3 overall cost (1349.88 Euro for 1251 m^3, and 274.58 Euro of fixed cost).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heating&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:right&#34;&gt;Electricity&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:right&#34;&gt;Heat Pump&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:right&#34;&gt;Gas&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Heat generated&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right&#34;&gt;10 kWh&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right&#34;&gt;10 kWh&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right&#34;&gt;10 kWh&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Energy used&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right&#34;&gt;10 kWh&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right&#34;&gt;2-3 kWh&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right&#34;&gt;1^3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Cost per unit&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right&#34;&gt;0.225 Euro&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right&#34;&gt;0.225 Euro&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right&#34;&gt;1.32 Euro&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Total cost&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right&#34;&gt;2.25 Euro&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right&#34;&gt;0.5-0.75 Euro&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:right&#34;&gt;1.32 Euro&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to create 10 kWh of warmth from a heat pump, you have to expend 2-3 kWh of electricity, coming in at 50 ct to 75 ct per m^3 gas-equivalent of heating.
That would be around 1.75 to 2.5 times cheaper than heating with gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A heat exchanger can be a air-water-air system, so a heat exchanger that uses energy from outside air to heat water that is fed into the existing heating.
This will work to around -10 C to -20 C outside temperatur, but for temperatures below zero, it will become successively inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your area permits it, you can take energy not from outside air, but from the water or earth below the house.
This is virtually always frost-free and hence relatively efficient.
So if you have a houseboat or are allowed to install an earth circuit, this can be a completely painless solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Existing radiators driven by heat exchangers almost always need adjustment or exchange, because the water-in temperature of the system is substantially lower than a preexisting gas burner.
So somebody with actual clue will have to do the math and adjustment during installation, and some people will have to either change radiators, or install active venting (fans, basically) that push air through the radiators as a leisurely pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need air condition anyway, because for example there is a roof room that needs active cooling in summer, you can make sure that you get an airco unit that can operate in reverse mode.
Most of the units that support it are as efficient as heat exchangers, and heat air directly.
Here the work factor is comparable to normal heat exchangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either system will get you off gas, or (with the airco) work in parallel to an existing gas or oil heating – which is nice in case you do not trust the new system and need backup.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Jetbrains Remote Development</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/06/27/jetbrains-remote-development.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2022 04:48:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/06/27/jetbrains-remote-development.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am on a Mac or on a Windows machine, and always I have to develop for a Linux target.
On Windows, this is easy, because most Jetbrains environment already support working inside WSL2, so simply choosing this is a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On MacOS, I can create a &amp;ldquo;Docker Container&amp;rdquo; do develop in, but it is kind of a joke.
That is, because MacOS cannot run Linux cgroups and namespaces natively, so you actually get a lightweight VM with Linux running, and then a container inside that.
You might as well run Linux in VMware and start the Jetbrains thing inside that.
It will hurt probably less than trying to edit inside a docker filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And sometimes you do not just need a Linux box, but an actual development environment that runs on one specific server that you have ssh access to.
Remote editing is &amp;ldquo;easy&amp;rdquo; in vscode, but there is no &amp;ldquo;my file tree is on that machine&amp;rdquo; mode in Jetbrains stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or is there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;enter-the-gateway&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#enter-the-gateway&#34;&gt;
	Enter the Gateway
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, there is something better.
The Jetbrains Gateways runs their editor, headless, on the remote machine, and that editor edits.
The client is the GUI, and that runs natively on your development machine, using the native GUI and key bindings.
GUI and remote editor communicate, the same way &amp;ldquo;Code with me&amp;rdquo; communicates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install &amp;ldquo;Jetbrains Gateway&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up ssh connectivity in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start a new project, watch it download and install the development environment remotely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter the project and edit away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/06/jetbrains-gateway1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yup, it&amp;rsquo;s beta.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;does-it-even-work&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#does-it-even-work&#34;&gt;
	Does it even work?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, yes.
I can hit the &amp;ldquo;Terminal&amp;rdquo; tab, and get an actual shell on the remote box.
I can run and build stuff as if I would be running the GUI locally on the remote box.
The native binaries are what I have on the remote box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, no.
It&amp;rsquo;s beta.
Sometimes it gets stuck, and sometimes the keys are &amp;ldquo;glue-ey&amp;rdquo;, that is, latency can be felt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually it helps to disconnect or kill the local client and then reconnect to the remote session.
Sometimes that needs to be done more than once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, yes.
Facinatingly, the remote session stays if you kill the local client, and on reconnect will be still there, blinking cursor and everything, just where you left it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I think this is going to change the way it work. At least when the remaining problems are fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/06/jetbrains-gateway2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Connecting to the Blog.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently there is a blog article from &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/blog/2021/12/03/dive-into-jetbrains-gateway/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;December 2021&lt;/a&gt;

 which describes how it works in more detail.
With the upcoming &amp;ldquo;Fleet&amp;rdquo;, it seems that they will be going all-in on the split between IDE backend and frontend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/em&gt; I am a paying customer of Jetbrains, and have the private user all-in subscription, paid for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Breaking replication with ALGORITHM = INSTANT</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/06/20/mysql-breaking-replication-with-algorithm-instant.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/06/20/mysql-breaking-replication-with-algorithm-instant.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;MySQL 8.0.29 adds &lt;code&gt;ALGORITHM=INSTANT&lt;/code&gt; as a way to run &lt;code&gt;ALTER TABLE&lt;/code&gt; commands with less wait.
The documentation can be found in &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-online-ddl-operations.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Online DDL Operators&lt;/a&gt;

 and instant column operations can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-online-ddl-operations.html#online-ddl-column-operations&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example Syntax looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

 explains a new concept:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new row version is created after each &lt;code&gt;ALTER TABLE ... ALGORITHM=INSTANT&lt;/code&gt; operation that adds one or more columns, drops one or more columns, or adds and drops one or more columns in the same operation.
The &lt;code&gt;INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_TABLES.TOTAL_ROW_VERSIONS&lt;/code&gt; column tracks the number of row versions for a table.
The value is incremented each time a column is instantly added or dropped.
The initial value is 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+--------+--------------------+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;kris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;                  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+--------+--------------------+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So there is a concept called &lt;code&gt;TOTAL_ROW_VERSIONS&lt;/code&gt;.
This is a version counter for instant alter table, and it is incremented each time a change to a table&amp;rsquo;s schema is being made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manual continues with a warning:
The TRV counter has a limit of 64.
Commands are rejected when the counter is reaching the limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a table with instantly added or dropped columns is rebuilt by table-rebuilding &lt;code&gt;ALTER TABLE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;OPTIMIZE TABLE&lt;/code&gt; operation, the &lt;code&gt;TOTAL_ROW_VERSIONS&lt;/code&gt; value is reset to 0.
The maximum number of row versions permitted is 64, as each row version requires additional space for table metadata.
When the row version limit is reached, &lt;code&gt;ADD COLUMN&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DROP COLUMN&lt;/code&gt; operations using &lt;code&gt;ALGORITHM=INSTANT&lt;/code&gt; are rejected with an error message that recommends rebuilding the table using the &lt;code&gt;COPY&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;INPLACE&lt;/code&gt; algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ERROR 4080 (HY000): Maximum row versions reached for table test/t1. No more columns can be added or dropped instantly. Please use COPY/INPLACE.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-obvious-breakage&#34;&gt;
	The obvious breakage
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a command is rejected, when TRV reaches 64.
Also, MySQL uses replication a lot.
In fact, I am of the persuasion that any MySQL installation that does not have at least one replica is broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So can we use this to break replication?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manual suggests that &lt;code&gt;OPTIMIZE TABLE&lt;/code&gt; can be used to reset the counter.
The manual knows the following things about &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/optimize-table.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;OPTIMIZE&lt;/a&gt;

:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a syntax &lt;code&gt;OPTIMIZE LOCAL TABLE&lt;/code&gt;.
»By default, the server writes &lt;code&gt;OPTIMIZE TABLE&lt;/code&gt; statements to the binary log so that they replicate to replicas.
To suppress logging, specify the optional &lt;code&gt;NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG&lt;/code&gt; keyword or its alias &lt;code&gt;LOCAL&lt;/code&gt;.«&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is not privileged: »This statement requires &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;INSERT&lt;/code&gt; privileges for the table.«&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now do this: With &lt;code&gt;dbdeployer&lt;/code&gt; we &lt;code&gt;dbdeployer deploy replication 8.0.29&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the primary: &lt;code&gt;./m -u root&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;total_row_versions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;information_schema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;innodb_tables&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;like&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;kris/%&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now inject the &lt;code&gt;OPTIMIZE LOCAL TABLE&lt;/code&gt; command to plant the bomb.
This can be done by the &lt;code&gt;kris&lt;/code&gt; user, or any other user having &lt;code&gt;INSERT&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; privilege.
It is not necessary to have &lt;code&gt;ALTER&lt;/code&gt; privilege, as long as you know that somebody else is doing instant alter table commands on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-mysql&#34; data-lang=&#34;mysql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;optimize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, continue to add and drop the column &lt;code&gt;t.i&lt;/code&gt; as before.
Check the TRV value on the primary and a replica.
Note how the TRV value on the primary is lower than on the replica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the TRV value reaches 64 on the replica, replication will stop with error 4080.
The replica is unable to execute the alter table command, while the primary was able to run it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Carver S&#43;</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/06/08/carver-s.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Jun 2022 04:17:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/06/08/carver-s.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After getting &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/05/02/a-solar-roof.html&#34;&gt;a solar roof&lt;/a&gt;

 we have been looking at electric mobility solutions.
But existing electrical cars seemed pretty much oversized.
We do not really need a 4-seater with 650km range and two tons of total empty weight.
Katja Diehl coined the german tongue-in-cheek term &amp;ldquo;Maximaleventualbedarfsauto&amp;rdquo; for it, the car that meets biggest use-case you could possibly reasonably have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking around, we test drove a &lt;a href=&#34;https://carver.earth/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Carver.Earth&lt;/a&gt;

, which was the right size, but limited to 45 km/h (and bike pathes in some areas).
Then Carver started to offer the &amp;ldquo;Carver S+&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/06/carver1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/06/carver2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/06/carver3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vehicle can be driven with an A-license or a B-license from before 2013.
It has 2 seats placed one after the other, and the back seat is rather basic.
It goes 80 km/h on a 7.1kWh LFP battery, which is good for circa 100 km, if you do not go 80 all of the time.
It carves, which means that it leans into curves in a rather awesome way (less awesome if you set &amp;ldquo;comfort&amp;rdquo; mode, which I strongly recommend).
It has no steering or brake assist, which means you get to work a bit.
But at 330kg total system weight, empty, it is pretty manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/06/carver4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/06/carver5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The car charges with a regular household plug, but a type 2 adapter is available.
It will still not fast charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completely filling it up to 7.1 kWh from 10% charge took 4h and the house consumed 7.1kWh during that time (but we have base load and made a coffee).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/06/carver6.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/06/carver7.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So all in all a pretty good match, and exactly what we expected.
Radically less car, so exactly the right amount of car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/06/carver8.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
