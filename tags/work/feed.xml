      <title>A Great Resignation, Management Edition</title>

      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/06/22/a-great-resignation-management-edition.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is not much of a blog post, but just a &lt;a href=&#34;https://chaos.social/@isotopp/110586700595558261&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;thread dump from Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;

 as requested by a friend,
because my Mastodon posts expire after some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my work and the people I know, I have some (remote) view into what happens in a few companies at the C- and Mid-Level management.
And from where I sit, it seems the great resignation is not only a thing that affects workers, but also managers.
It is almost funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These people are often pretty awesome administrative people.
Mid-level managers with amazing Jira- and Miro-skills, breaking down large work parcels of well-understood jobs into team-sized packages,
describing the requirements and planning the required hours, then mapping them onto calendars.
Or budget jugglers that take large unstructured sums of cost, and find a way to parcel them out in a halfway reasonable way into individual cost centers and items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;digital-and-other-transformations&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#digital-and-other-transformations&#34;&gt;
	Digital and other transformations
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These companies are also all in a series of transformations, at all levels of the stack simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many are moving on-premises workloads to cloud, but the workloads are not cloud-shaped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two enterprises I happen to know about are also changing their implementation language from something exotic to something less efficient, but a lot easier to hire for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One enterprise is also breaking up a monolithic application into a set of microservices, but the cut lines are unclear and need to be found.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One enterprise is modifying the way they do business from a single product to a series of interconnected and interdependent products, some of them in highly regulated markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another enterprise is changing the way they make their product from mostly manual labor into something based on sensor input and data science.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These transformations require a different kind of manager:
they need less of an administrative person, and more business process designer;
they require a different kind of empowerment and delegation, from the top to them, and from them on downwards – much more autonomous on the delegation poker side;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is also needed is an entirely different kind of understanding of the company itself, less interchangeable business administration skills,
and more business-specific skills about how the sausage is made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that are traditional hierarchies and communication structures that are based on in-person attendance and mostly oral tradition,
and a skill-set that is well suited for the Clear and Complicated domains of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;the Cynefin-Model&lt;/a&gt;

,
but wrong for the Complex and Chaotic domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Enterprise cannot perform the set of transitions it must execute to stay relevant,
when the entire Org and the people that carry and build the structure of the Org are incapable of transforming their way of working to match the problem.
So they leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which for an organization that is in the Complex and Chaotic realm of a transformation makes the problem worse,
because the intimate knowledge of the processes that make this company unique and competitive goes with them.
The people coming in have to learn these things,
but if the Org does not have &lt;em&gt;written&lt;/em&gt; account of what matters and has no way of &lt;em&gt;teaching&lt;/em&gt; these things that make this company special,
it basically loses its specialty and becomes meaningless, interchangeable and then soon extinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-remote-work-does-for-companies&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-remote-work-does-for-companies&#34;&gt;
	What Remote Work does for companies
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funnily,
companies that optimize for remote work are also companies
that out of necessity optimize for a written instead of an oral culture.
They tend to have very well documented ways of specifying and teaching what they do, why and how,
and a proper self-service onboarding process complemented by a mentoring system –
and that also works for mid- and C-level management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that optimize for remote are executing transformations easier because they understand their meta better.
Many workers understand that.
Maybe not in this way or even in words, but they can read the room, and they are reacting to their environment, especially the skilled ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A preference for remote work is useful even, or especially, if you come into the office,
because a company that can do remote properly understands what it does and how it works better than a company that executes &amp;ldquo;remote&amp;rdquo; with a &amp;ldquo;zoom harder&amp;rdquo; policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;interviewing-to-find-organizations-that-know-their-stuff&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#interviewing-to-find-organizations-that-know-their-stuff&#34;&gt;
	Interviewing to find organizations that know their stuff
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when you interview, these are useful and interesting questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did your company change their way of working during Covid?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did your management style evolve under Covid and after?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you detect misalignment, disagreement or conflict or other causes for in-person meetings when working remotely,
and what are the ways you handle these situations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you evolve agreement from oral consensus to documentation to training material?
How do you document and teach processes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did your way of working as a person and as a member of the Org evolve in the last 5 years?
What can you point to that illustrates process maturation and advancement?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what way did your Org execute transformations in the last five years?
That certainly was not frictionless.
What worked, what didn&amp;rsquo;t, what did the Org learn?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that reads a lot like a reverse interview – well, that&amp;rsquo;s what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the objective is clear:
You want to find out if the org you are about to join has access to its own meta,
and if it can change and consciously design its org structure, work, and communications culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All companies right now are executing a series of transformations at multiple levels of their business.
That is because the world right now is a lot less stable than it used to be in the last 50 years.
But only those that do not let these things happen to them, but are actively shaping the process will not be painful to work at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must find these early in the interview process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, the information you want to find when interviewing for a job is again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Does this company shape itself and its future consciously?
Does it design itself?
Or does change happen to the org accidentally?
Does it understand what it does, and why? Or are they winging it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most management is winging it, most companies are cheating their way to the next quarterlies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do your work, but you do have an understanding of what management is supposed to do.
Does management understand their job, tho?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you respect your current or future management?
Can they express the value they provide in a way &lt;em&gt;that is understandable and meaningful to you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can they explain the business, and what specifically the competitive advantage is this org has within its own competitive set?
Do they know why this differentiation exists, and how it is protected or extended?
Do they understand in what way the structure they are building and upholding helps in doing this?
And how it needs to change to be able to continue?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, you want to find out if they know the C-level strategy they exist in.
If they know what direction everybody is supposed to march in, and what their local objectives are as a part of the greater whole.
You need to find out if they have context that they are making local decisions in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, it is this (and not ping-pong tables) that builds engagement and loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People love to work for a company that understands how it functions,
and can talk sensibly about this – about its business and communication processes,
and the why and how of useful interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People love to work for organizations that have an idea of how to change and into what, instead of being shaped by accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;stressors&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#stressors&#34;&gt;
	Stressors
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another contributing factor is that transformations interrupt the value extraction process of neoliberal shareholder value,
and also upsets established hierarchies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shifting to the left side of the Cynefin model means you need smaller teams of higher qualified people.
Teams that perform work in a way that is much harder to quantify,
and create value that is hard to express in right-side organizational structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, shareholders and their demand for dividend and rising stock value interfere with the investment needs,
increased risk and hard to measure gains that transformations require,
and thus the owners of the enterprise are an impediment to the change that the company needs to be able to continue to deliver value to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, some individual owners always understand that problem,
but the owners as a group don&amp;rsquo;t and can&amp;rsquo;t and are working against their own best interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Side Remark:&lt;/em&gt; Similar structural pressure is currently visible in German society, at the &amp;ldquo;Berlin vs. Berlin Outskirts&amp;rdquo; conflict or at the national mobility and energy transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IC: &amp;ldquo;The existing code is bad and undocumented. Three weeks for the fix, provided there are no landmines.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M: &amp;ldquo;So you commit to 3w?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IC: &amp;ldquo;No, because I don&amp;rsquo;t know if there are landmines. Usually there are.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M: &amp;ldquo;But I need a binding commitment to before the end of July!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s lack of tech understanding paired with pressure from the shareholder end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;another-friend-talks-about-stressors&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#another-friend-talks-about-stressors&#34;&gt;
	Another friend talks about Stressors
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M: &amp;ldquo;My personal theory is that we are running into some inherent limits of the current management model during the last decade and are now seeing stress fractures.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K: &amp;ldquo;But the question is where the stress is originating.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M: &amp;ldquo;Complexity (as observed at each management level).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K: &amp;ldquo;Ok, that matches what I think if you accept that it is these transformations that are causing the stress. What you call stress fractures I call transformation overload.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M (responding to the three-week-commitment example above):
&amp;ldquo;A good example for what I mean by complexity at that management level:
The manager can communicate only a scalar detail upwards, but the problem is a complex data object.
The manager cannot report what happens nor the risk properly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K: &amp;ldquo;A command and control management is unable to handle situations that require nuance and understanding of detail?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M: &amp;ldquo;Yes. Management level A needs to reduce their stress, and forces their lower level B to simplify. That increases pressure and stress at the level of B.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M: C has called this &amp;ldquo;driven by financials.&amp;rdquo;
The only universal scalar is Euro,
but expressing all things in Euros is becoming increasingly harder and is losing information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M: A lot of fighting and pressure is actually about &amp;ldquo;simplify your reporting&amp;rdquo; vs. &amp;ldquo;accept my complexity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M: &amp;ldquo;This is also in part why we see a preference for managed services. They are an attempt to encapsulate complexity. Often that fails, and the complexity reappears and attacks the PO consuming that service.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C: &amp;ldquo;A way to solve the conflict is to ask more &amp;lsquo;Why&amp;rsquo; questions downstack, and to create more tasks that allow for interpretation.&amp;rdquo;
That is basically a move to the left-hand side of Cynefin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M: &amp;ldquo;That requires a trust that is larger than Euro-Scalars. And ultimately that breaks at the shareholder-level, latest.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H2: &amp;ldquo;And non-technical management also believes these things are simple. Click here, and ChatGPT will develop the software autonomously. It&amp;rsquo;s those pesky IT people making all these things that complicated.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Meditations on Quitting</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/12/27/meditations-on-quitting.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Dec 2022 01:02:03 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/12/27/meditations-on-quitting.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I quit often.
At least once a year, but there have been years when I have been quitting four times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time before a performance evaluation, or before important meetings, I sit down and write myself a notice.
I pull up a word processor, start the empty business letter template, fill in the details and the date, and then write the three or four sentences necessary to inform my employer that the time has come to part ways.
I print this, collect the letter, fold it properly and put it into an empty unsealed envelope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I pull it out, unfold it and put it in front of me.
Time to start thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are the logistics of quitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of that is about obligations and finance.
Could I actually walk out of the meeting, leaving the letter behind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been times, when I was younger, where I easily could have done that. Not owning property, being unmarried and without child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a consultant, with 180 travel days a year, I had to build my own personal insurance anyway.
That&amp;rsquo;s  400 in the pocket at any point in time, 4k on an unused rescue credit card &amp;ndash; enough to take me home on my own from anywhere my job would take me.
And a coordinate transformation on my checking account that sees a few 10k as Zero, to provide immediate emergency burn fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough buffer against possible bumps anywhere in the world is also enough buffer to leave when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a family and a house, things are more complicated, and no longer immediate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An exit plan cannot be &amp;ldquo;walking out and leaving the letter&amp;rdquo; when an uninterrupted cash flow is part of the requirements.
But writing the letter is still an important focus point.
So I kept the tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is like a business continuity management plan, but for your soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the logistics done, it is time to lift the gaze from the path in front of my feet, up to the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did I do the last few months?
What projects do I have been part of?
What have I learned?
How have I grown?
And is the place I am in still the place that would let me grow?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no abstract questions.
But in my mind they only become real when I sit in front of this piece of paper, and think about staying or leaving.
I have made sure I could leave if I wanted.
Now it is time to think about what I want from this place to make me stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sometimes explain this to others as the story of the two contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in IT, you always have two contracts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is written.
It says what your job title is, where you work, and what they pay you.
It says what your notice period is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other one is unwritten.
It is the unspoken agreement about the level of autonomy you have, and the decisions you can be part of.
It is the environment you work in and what challenges you can learn from.
It is about the things you build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in IT, I always signed, and I always actually quit, because of this second contract.
When it expires or is violated, it is time to actually leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it all becomes about people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies by construction are usually not loyal to their employees.
In general, as organisations they can&amp;rsquo;t.
Some people inside an org maybe secretly work against the objectives of the organisations and are loyal to other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a person, I always work with other persons.
Over the last 30 years, it has become clear that these persons stay, even when I move.
I am part of my own personal tribe.
I have been building it, maintaining it over a few decades, and when necessary they have been there for me, and I have been there for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the meditation of quitting is also remembering these people.
Maybe they need me.
Maybe I need them.
Maybe I miss them.
Maybe some of them have an invitation or an opportunity for me.
Holding the bond of my current second contract against the pulls from my relationships gives me an important calibration of where I am, who I am and if I am honest with myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually then I have come to some conclusion and I have a plan.
I can fold the notice back up into the envelope, put it into my jacket, and walk into that meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am now grounded, and I know my boundaries, and my goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know who I am.
For some reason that seems to scare people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually then I don&amp;rsquo;t actually have to quit.
But being able to do that, and understanding when and why helps a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 2023-Jan-31, after almost another seven years, my second tour of Booking.com will come to an end.
It was a different ride than the first, it was still amazing, and I met the most wonderful and amazing people.
Still, I have been called, and the second contract is up.
I have to move.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Groups and Places</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/10/12/groups-and-places.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Oct 2022 06:07:08 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/10/12/groups-and-places.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a distributed, asynchronous environment, there is a need for distributed, asynchronous interaction.
This interaction is often written, but &amp;ldquo;writing&amp;rdquo; these days is actually a media-rich process that includes much more than letters.
It also needs to be able to build some structure, and some gateway to level up to more synchronous and even richer communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s have a chat about chats, and what properties they have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/10/groups-places-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Historically, chat was lines of text, without much structure. Even today, many geeks often propose IRC when chat solutions are being discussed in a corporate context. That is a very myopic way of thinking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first chat network I have been using was IRC &amp;ndash; Internet Relay Chat.
This has been in the late 80ies or early 90ies, so today I have had an interactive online presence on the upside of 25 years or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I got to use ICQ, Jabber, Skype, Hangouts, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Slack and RocketChat, among many others.
I also got exposed to a number of collaborative document processing systems with chat-like properties:
the now defunct Google Wave (alias Apache Wave, now also mostly defunct), and its heir Google Docs, and a bunch of newer collaborative brainstorming tools from the School of Miro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these applications and chat systems are different, but they can be evaluated along a number of dimensions to understand chat systems better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/10/groups-places-02.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of my chat desktop from 2016. There are many like it, but this is mine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;location-and-discoverability&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#location-and-discoverability&#34;&gt;
	Location and Discoverability
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important functions any chat system has to have is enabling the right people to find each other.
There are two large classes of chat systems here: One uses groups, and the other uses places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups are just that: collections of people that talk to each other.
You write a message and sent it.
It is then visible to all members of the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with groups is that they are almost impossible to find.
They are invitation only.
A member of the group must have knowledge of you looking for the group, and then invite you to it.
In some messengers this will also form a new group, destroying the messaging history of the older group, in order to protect the privacy of the conversation happening before the new member joined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/10/groups-places-03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Discord chat system allows you to form small scale groups with fixed membership, even without having a &amp;ldquo;Discord Server&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better system uses Places (often called Rooms or Channels) instead of Groups.
A place is discoverable, you can &amp;ldquo;find&amp;rdquo; it, &amp;ldquo;go&amp;rdquo; to it, and &amp;ldquo;join&amp;rdquo; without being explicitly invited (permission and moderation systems often exist).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Places tend to proliferate, mechanism to group, order, tag and search them often exist.
In Discord, for example, Channels can be grouped into Categories, which are then grouped into &amp;ldquo;Servers&amp;rdquo;, the server having an owner, and often a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/10/groups-places-04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Discord chat system, showing the &amp;ldquo;heiseonline&amp;rdquo; discord server, with a channel named &lt;code&gt;#tierbilder&lt;/code&gt; (Animal Pictures) selected. Below that, a Category for &lt;code&gt;Sprachkanäle&lt;/code&gt; (Voice Channels) is seen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having Places instead of Groups is crucial for any communication system.
It gives you the capability to write instructions that send people somewhere, and enables people to find and go somewhere, gives them agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebooks Messenger and Facebook at Work&amp;rsquo;s greatest flaw is their Messenger, which does not have this feature.
It relies on Groups, and tries to mitigate that by coupling groups to Facebook &amp;ldquo;Groups&amp;rdquo; (discussion boards), auto-inviting people into the Facebook Group associated chat group.
This combines worst practices of several systems into one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Places can be persistent, they can exist without anyone being in them.
Places can also have one or multiple owners, which is the root of that Places&amp;rsquo; permission system and the source of all moderator power for that Place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;presence&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#presence&#34;&gt;
	Presence
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working asynchronously means that you will not be present in a chat at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a feature: It allows you to focus, and think straight, cutting deeply into problems.
It also allows you to be in another timezone than your communication partners and still contribute meaningfully to a collaborative effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It poses the problem of your communication partners not knowing your current communication status, and availability.
If they are blocked, they might need you, and it would help them to have some expectation of your response times, availability and context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All modern chat systems have a presence mechanism, a semi-automatic status tagline, and the more thoughtfully engineered ones also know your timezone and show it to your peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/10/groups-places-05.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Slack chat system allows users to set a status in the form of an Emoji and a tagline. These are automatically cleared after some preset time, if desired. Slack also understands time zones, and will show you out-of-office times of communication partners, when necessary. Clicking on a user will also reveal their location and local time. On the right hand side, a number of status bubble examples are shown.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presence management in chat system often goes hand in hand with logging.
Messages sent to you in your absence are logged, and shown to you on reconnect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all a giant step forward from IRC, which did not manage presence well, and also did not allow sending messages to disconnected users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In IRC, being offline means not being present: people fall off the channel and what is being said with them being not there is lost to them.
That is of course a nuisance, and so people have been using programs such as screen to run an IRC client even when they have been disconnected from their computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IRC&amp;rsquo;s mechanism for presence (here: attention) is somewhat hidden &amp;ndash; the &lt;code&gt;/away&lt;/code&gt; command.
But not only is the mechanism hidden (it is another command that needs to be learned and used), but the status is somewhat hidden as well.
You can&amp;rsquo;t see if somebody is &lt;code&gt;/away&lt;/code&gt; unless you look at them with a &lt;code&gt;/whois&lt;/code&gt;.
Or you learn about the fact that they are &lt;code&gt;/away&lt;/code&gt; only after the fact, when you say something to them and get an auto-response with their &lt;code&gt;/away&lt;/code&gt; message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people do not like this, and so they use another mechanism and change their nicknames when they are not there &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Isotopp&amp;rdquo; becomes &amp;ldquo;Isotopp|AFK&amp;rdquo; or similar.
This is less structured than &lt;code&gt;/away&lt;/code&gt;, and so some people suffix their names, some prefix them and others completely change their nicknames - &amp;ldquo;Isotopp&amp;rdquo; becomes &amp;ldquo;Awaytopp&amp;rdquo;.
The lack of facility, discoverable interface and standardization creates variant practice.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#logging-and-multi-device&#34;&gt;
	Logging and Multi-Device
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All modern chat clients have proper presence, even if not always as rich as in Slack.
Most also have unified logging.
That is, even absent users can receive messages and will see them when coming back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most users in 2022 have multiple devices, and multiple clients.
Most users want the entire messaging history, in order, and with all backlog, available on all their devices, so that they can switch between devices without losing context.
This usually includes new devices, to facilitate moving to new laptops or cellphones, without losing history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This often clashes with old standards, badly designed security mechanisms and other implementation details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/10/groups-places-06.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Google Talk log, with OTR encryption, viewed in a different Jabber client. The history is truncated, and OTR encrypted messages are not available in readable form in this client.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One extreme point for synchronisation is the Discord chat system, where not only history and messages are kept in sync across all clients, but even preferences are unified:
Setting the desktop client to dark mode will also set dark mode on the cellphone application, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another, opposite extreme point is Jabber, which has no common rule for disposition of messages, and by default will send messages only to one client, using either a preference system, the last active client, or &amp;ldquo;all known clients to the server at the point in time the message was sent&amp;rdquo;. A lot depends on server and clients used here, creating an unreliable and hard to control user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a corporate context, we use the communication mechanism as a vehicle to create and share documents, and have a discussion about the documents we work on collaboratively.
Mail was doing this in the past, with Quotes and with Attachments, but that is a very cumbersome, lossy and hard to discover mechanism.
Most companies have moved the collaboration process off mail, to a large extent, and towards chat and collaborative document systems such as Google Docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google had taken this one step further with structured chat.
The pioneer application for that has been the short-lived Google Wave:
Wave allowed a group of people to create things in a kind of chat bubble, only that this bubble could not just hold a line of text, but also other media including rich documents, images, bots or other things that interfaced with the Wave API.
Other users could comment on an item in a hierarchic comments-on-comment tree like in a discussion system, or directly edit the original item, incorporating their changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes were recorded and were undoable and replayable.
This allowed users to view the end result of a Wave, or review the process of building that result after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/10/groups-places-07.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Wave being used to collaboratively work on a shared document. The Wave contains the final document, but also the process that led to the end result.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way, Wave could have been a salvation from the hell of corporate email:
Waves produce results, documents or agreements.
They also record the history of how that result had been reached, and they allow people joining the process late to catch up and review what has happened before on their own terms.
No more full quotes, 13 levels deep, and no more dozens of copies of the same Word file, all slightly different, and with diverging side remarks from people somewhere in the organisation, which never made it back into the main document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wave failed, though, and for multiple reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the bigger reasons is that Wave was all mechanism and no purpose &amp;ndash; it could to many things, and offered all of them without stating what Wave itself or the various functions are there for.
One could use Wave to manage a world building and game session in a role playing game, as well as replace corporate email, or use it as a rather clunky and over-engineered word processor.
So Wave needed explanation and contextualisation - and above all, a purpose, but none was given.
Wave died, because it confused users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/10/groups-places-08.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A collaboratively edited document. Multiple watchers are shown as icons at the top of the screen. A chat window is open. Cursors and collaborators edits would be visible simultaneously editing the document in many places while it has been initially created.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wave&amp;rsquo;s legacy lives on, though.
Much of the functionality of Wave is present in Google Docs, including the side chat, collaborative editing, history recording and replay and many other functions.
Unlike Wave, Google&amp;rsquo;s shared document editing puts the purpose first, and the collaboration in the background.
This is matching people&amp;rsquo;s expectations much better, and is less overwhelming.
It does not have to be taught, or manually given purpose.
Instead, the purpose is built in, and immediately obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern chat systems are kind of the opposite:
They put their purpose (communication) first, and the documents ride in the back.
This happens either through URLs or through file transfer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All modern chat systems have a working file transfer, which is also aware of media types.
That means, not only can you drag and drop files into a 1:1 chat or a channel, but also images or animations, as well as audio files.
They are understood, and shown inline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with other mechanisms, such as threads, they enable unique workflows that go way past the unstructured ASCII-limited text of IRC.
For example, in many workplaces designers use the image capabilities of Slack, together with Slack threads, to share images, mockups and other things and then criticize or approve designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also where not only IRC, but also Jabber falls down.
Proper file sharing, inline media content and threading are things that may exist somewhere, in some Jabber extension, but are not generally interoperable or enabled without much configuration across a set of clients.
They might as well not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;we-were-lucky&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#we-were-lucky&#34;&gt;
	We were lucky
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the place I work at, we were lucky.
By the time Covid pushed people to work from home, we already had replaced mail almost completely.
I was down from thousands of mail messages per day on almost one hundred mailing lists to less than a dozen messages, and no mailing lists at all anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have moved to &lt;strong&gt;Facebook at Work&lt;/strong&gt; for non-realtime group communication.
Teams were using their Facebook groups to communicate announcements and progress to other teams, and have discussions with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internally and for support we moved to &lt;strong&gt;Slack&lt;/strong&gt;.
This was pushed with considerable force from below, after corporate initially being very fond of Facebook messenger, mostly because it was free and included in Facebook at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately FB messenger is utterly broken in many ways, and unsuited for any structured work communication without basically rewriting it from scratch.
There are many facets to its fractal brokenness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has groups, but no places.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Groups have limited attendance, and the limit is too small (the old &lt;code&gt;#live&lt;/code&gt; Jabber channel was mandatory for all people pushing deployments, and could not be reproduced in FB Messenger).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It ate data. Mentioning a filename &lt;code&gt;main.pl&lt;/code&gt; would inescapably turn this into a polish hostname &lt;a href=&#34;https://main.pl&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;main.pl&lt;/a&gt;

. More often than not, Messenger would detect a malware phishing attempt and prevent you from sending the message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It ate data. Mentioning URLs with array parameters (&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://example.com/bla?a=1&amp;amp;a=2&amp;amp;a=3%22&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://example.com/bla?a=1&amp;a=2&amp;a=3&#34;&lt;/a&gt;

) would make it parse the URL, representing the keys in a hash, and dropping the repeated keys, breaking the URL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It could not handle files, code formatting and many other things well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It could not do threads, which are a necessity in high volume support channels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, corp was forced to also purchase Slack on top of FB at Work, to prevent a more or less open revolt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had been using &lt;strong&gt;Google Drive and Google Office&lt;/strong&gt;, as well, across the company, and the collaborative features in it were well understood and used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heterogeneity of all of this posed to be not a problem, somewhat surprisingly.
In fact, in many cases, the mix-and-match approach enabled us to be flexible, and work around many tools limitations, and also to expand and integrate other things easily.
Other applications (e.g. Miro, but also many others) have since been added for many users, who have other, more specialized needs and requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also used to use BlueJeans, before the pandemic, and mostly from meeting room installations with dedicated hardware.
During Covid, Zoom became popular, and offered a richer and much better set of clients, especially on mobile devices (Laptops, Tablets, Cellphones), so we switched vendors here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key learnings are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We already had tooling for Remote First, but had hardly any need to use them properly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We were hardly using Email with all its glorious brokenness anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By happy accident, the core tools (FB at Work, Slack) had Places, not Groups, as a core metaphor, and people structured their work around these places.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborative document editing and a rich, structured chat complement each other well. But since Facebook and Google both are unable to make such a thing, we have yet another vendor integrated. This turned out to be an actual advantage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our key deficits have not been discussed at length here, but are related:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Office documents have very bad discoverability and Google Office has no places.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corollary: A process is needed and needs to be manually executed to move content from the collaborative phase to the publication phase, elsewhere.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By public decree in our place this is going to be Confluence, which has problems of its own, and also poses a document conversion problem (from Google to Confluence internal format, keeping structure).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code Collaboration is not part of other collaboration at all, and lives in a third, and entirely disconnected space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/10/10/pan-narrans-and-better-meetings.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 10 Oct 2022 12:13:14 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/10/10/pan-narrans-and-better-meetings.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you are looking for a better &lt;em&gt;Remote First&lt;/em&gt; culture, you are looking for better meetings.
If you go for better meetings, you will also have fewer of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/362504-the-anthropologists-got-it-wrong-when-they-named-our-species&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/10/pan-narrans-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The anthropologists got it wrong when they named our species Homo sapiens (&amp;lsquo;wise man&amp;rsquo;). In any case it&amp;rsquo;s an arrogant and bigheaded thing to say, wisdom being one of our least evident features. In reality, we are Pan narrans, the storytelling chimpanzee.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going for a written culture helps, going for storytelling will help even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;storytelling&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#storytelling&#34;&gt;
	Storytelling
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost 15 years ago, I wrote about an experience with the roleplaying game &lt;em&gt;Primetime Adventures&lt;/em&gt;.
If you are reading German, &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2008/10/05/drsrm-2008-primetime-adventures.html&#34;&gt;check it out&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things to take away from Primetime Adventures is that &amp;ldquo;on screen&amp;rdquo; nothing happens without reason, all interactions serve the story.
And the story is always about conflict:
Anything from misunderstandings to misaligned goals, from disagreement about a mission to disagreement about fundamental values, from friendly competition to outright fighting over starved resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end it does not matter, but screen time is always about the current conflict, because to the Storytelling Chimpanzee this is what it&amp;rsquo;s about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, at the core, also true about meetings.
If they are not about conflict, they are not worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does not have to be conflict about the people in the meeting.
The meeting does not have to resolve the conflict (but should progress it somewhow).
But in every meeting there is some kind of conflict in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember: Not all conflict is drama, in fact, most is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;understanding-conflict&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#understanding-conflict&#34;&gt;
	Understanding conflict
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when you go for meetings, prepare an Agenda.
If you are invited to a meeting without an Agenda, decline it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is a good Agenda?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make an agenda and make it self-contained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should itemize the things you would like to talk about.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each item should have a short summary (&amp;ldquo;What happened so far&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Last week on …&amp;rdquo;) or link to one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should invite the people you need to talk to about the thing, the stakeholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then send the agenda around well in advance, maybe share a link to a shared document.
Allow people to change, amend, and comment the agenda.
Force them to interact with the document in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your goal, ultimately, is to either not have a meeting, because all agree.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or have a meeting, but only about the things you disagree about.
Or people have questions about things, which can only be resolved interactively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So invite people to actually comment.
Invite long form, have them write in the text.
Sidenotes are horrible to read, and basically are good for &lt;strong&gt;+1&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/strong&gt; only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invite people to agree with you, in the document, or to specify where the disagreement is exactly.
Disagreement can take many forms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can be insecurity (&amp;ldquo;The plan looks good in principle, but I fear that…&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can be misalignment (&amp;ldquo;You want to do …, but we actually need … on our side.&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can be resource shortage (&amp;ldquo;You want … from us, but that would require us to …, and we can&amp;rsquo;t do that in this Quarter.&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can be many other things. It always signals a need to communicate more, about a specific thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;commenting-on-agendas-kills-meetings&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#commenting-on-agendas-kills-meetings&#34;&gt;
	Commenting on Agendas kills meetings
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the Agenda and the Agenda Prep to collect agreement.
If there is no disagreement, it&amp;rsquo;s fine to not have the meeting, because the reason to have one just vanished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is disagreement, you now know where, and how, and what specifically is the perceived or real problem.
You can spend interactive time exactly on these things, and go over possible reconciliations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is all in a shared document, y&amp;rsquo;all can amend the discussion with additional writing and sidenotes as needed.
This is automatically also the meeting notes, so make sure they contain whatever the outcomes are y&amp;rsquo;all collectively agreed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark up deliverables, deadlines and people responsible.
Set a deadline with a followup meeting (which you can then try to kill in advance, too).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#kickoffs-cannot-be-killed&#34;&gt;
	Kickoffs cannot be killed
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One exception are kickoff meetings.
They exist to present the project, and project goals, to set the framework and to make sure you are talking to the right people, and &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the right people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They exist also for socializing, specifically to enable people to make the necessary connections.
You will be working together, you need to know each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So make it short, to the point, and make sure people can connect with each other directly afterwards, on their own.
This is important, because kickoffs cannot be killed.&lt;/p&gt;

	Reporting meetings can focus on interesting stuff
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding conflict, isolating interesting topics to talk about, also applies to reporting meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reporting meetings always read a lot of slides with a lot of numbers.
Everybody zones out.
&amp;ldquo;Last weeks SLOs for … were met completely, and we improved …&amp;rdquo;
Nobody is interested, skip that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all can look at the green in the report in advance.
Instead use the reporting meeting to speak about interesting things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be the &lt;em&gt;story&lt;/em&gt; of an outage, and what we learned.
It can be about the &lt;em&gt;story&lt;/em&gt; of an improvement, and how it will prevent a certain class of failure.
Or tell the &lt;em&gt;story&lt;/em&gt; of how you work, how you improve work, or how you work differently than other companies do, if that is useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing &lt;em&gt;stories&lt;/em&gt; about practice is much more interesting that reading numbers from a slide that is all green anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or skip the meeting.
If the numbers are all fine and there are no learnings, no interaction is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#making-it-interesting-making-it-valuable&#34;&gt;
	Making it interesting, making it valuable
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, finding out, in advance, what the meeting should be about, always means finding the conflict, determining its nature, and the stakes.
Uneven information, misaligned goals, differences about implementation or scope, resource allocation, whatever.
Knowing this, maybe even preparing alternatives, and then either developing or discovering them interactively, or deciding on them collectively helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also automatically prepares the meeting minutes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Agenda collects agreement, and preparing the meeting from the residual conflict in the Agenda then makes it simple to have minutes.
We have shared documents in 2022, so there is an easy way to make sure all voices are recorded.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#providing-value&#34;&gt;
	Providing value
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shared documents are also a burden:
They are hard to discover, maintain and organize.
I am increasingly a supporter of the idea that Google Docs should auto-delete after 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want deliverables, put them elsewhere, anywhere.
Heck, even Confluence would be a better location than a Google Drive.
In any case, you can create a consolidated version of the current state in a proper document, and then collect or link the path that led to it and attach it as documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t take meeting notes and call them deliverables, though.
That won&amp;rsquo;t work.
It never did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a discussion with interactive and written elements, is also a documentation evolution process, in which we collectively work on a deliverable: the architecture, documentation and implementation of a process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a proper store, and not in shared documents, much less in volatile spoken discussion without any record or recording.
We work to distill information, to shape an idea, and to bring it into the world, in a proper deliverable and in code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because that is what a company is about:
Making agreements on how we work together on a common thing (and building infrastructure to make this easier).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we have meeting agendas to collect agreement, and to sharpen disagreement, we have interactive meetings to find and ultimately document conflict resolutions, and we then put these back into the deliverable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the heart of asynchronous distributed collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if somebody asks you:
&amp;ldquo;What did your org learn to do differently in the last 3 years?&amp;rdquo;
and the answer is unlike the above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did you do instead? How did your org evolve?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;addenda&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#addenda&#34;&gt;
	Addenda
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This started out as a Twitter thread.
There have been reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Florian Haas pointed to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://xahteiwi.eu/resources/presentations/devopsdays-berlin-2022/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;really good writeup&lt;/a&gt;

 about writing of his.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He also mentions: &amp;ldquo;Re project kickoffs, never do them without preparing a 5-paragraph brief. Better still, circulate it ahead of the kickoff.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Spaces</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/02/21/spaces.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/02/21/spaces.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the morning of Saturday, 22nd February 2020, two years ago, my colleagues and I woke up to the a message from the company that said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Spaces&amp;rdquo; Closed for Operations 23 Feb - 28 Feb&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the morning hours of Saturday, 22 February, a fire occurred on the first floor of the &amp;ldquo;Spaces&amp;rdquo; building.
The fire was extinguished promptly but due to smoke and residue particles that spread throughout the building, we will not be able to open &amp;ldquo;Spaces&amp;rdquo; for at least one weeks time.
The closure of the building is required to ensure we fully inspect the building, our equipment, clean the office of all smoke damage and residue and more importantly, ensure we have a safe working environment to return to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It then took exactly one month instead of one week to fix that, and the planned reopening of the building fell on the exact day of the beginning of the COVID-19 lockdown.
So it has been today two years ago that I worked in an office the last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote into a company forum one year ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be keeping this up until at least October, and I would be surprised if we are not going to be doing this for much longer the way this country handles Covid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is the cluttered mess of my Desk at home:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/02/spaces-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Home machine, and lab equipment to the left, company Mac on the desk during the daytime, bunch of books left and right. On top, the stick for my Internet Spaceship. Under the desk to the right, the file server and gaming box.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very… lived in. I do change things too often for any pretty cabling or other cleanup to hold up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/02/spaces-2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At least it has a decent view. That one hour commute to Spaces did pay off with a much more rural and spacious environment for home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at least the view from my Desk is decent…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sitting on a Dauphin Shape XXL, a proper office chair instead of some gaming thing, and the desk is an older IKEA standing desk, motorized.
I have cabled Internet at my desk, Wifi by Unifi in the house, and we have a 500/500 Mbit fiber connection at home, because faster Internet is not available where I live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life ain’t bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never has been, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back, I always had a desk to work on at home. In Berlin, an entire room (which also had an office desk for my wife).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/02/spaces-3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Geek wife doing geek wifey things on her Berlin desk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Karlsruhe, my GF and I had work desks in an office room, and actually almost never did use our living room.
We sat back to back, because that makes it easy to roll over and look at the other screen to check things out and help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Kiel we had an office/living room double room, but the living room really saw use only on Tuesdays ever other week for the Tuesday meeting, when a bunch of Geeks were coming around for cooking and talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even as a student, having a working desk was more important than a proper living room, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/02/spaces-4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1996 computer science student desk (see below &amp;ndash; 1)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I am thinking about it, I believe it’s because of my Dad.
He had a Ham Radio license, and “his” place in the house always was his shack, with all the electronics, the radios and antenna controls, basically a desk and a workbench next to it.
You’d find him more often there than anywhere else in the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do we even have living rooms?
It’s a social convention that is hard to break.
I know that I would be in for a fight to the blood suggesting that we get rid of ours, but seriously?
“My” space is that desk/shack shown above, and not the living room.
It’s the place that I’ll fight for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussing this elsewhere, a friend sends me &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJWOWksT1x4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Space &amp;ndash; A cluttered life: Middle-Class Abundance&lt;/a&gt;

.
The video discusses space use in American middle class families, who seem to have lives centered around the kitchen/eating space, which makes a lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That 1996 desk.
That version of me had a Euro-ISDN semipermanent connection to my provider (128/128 kBit/s) and I also spent 50 Deutschmark for my own /24 provider independent IPv4 range.
All my machines had public addresses.
The machine is a Nextstation with 24 MB of memory, and a 25 MHz 68040 CPU, running what later would become MacOS X.
The white tower next to it has a 1 GB SCSI HDD full height (the two top slots), a 1x SCSI CD-ROM drive (Caddies required) and a SCSI QIC drive for DC 6525 tapes (525 MB/tape).
My body hides the full height tower case for the Dual-Pentium Linux box, you can only see the beige case of the b/w monitor it has.
We were using BNC based 10 MBit/s Ethernet at that time.
This box also has the ISDN card.
Unfortunately the driver had a memory leak, and we were losing a bit of memory every time the ISDN link goes up or down, because some driver internal data structures are allocated and never deallocated.
The loss accumulates to around 1 MB per week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Die kommende Kündigungswelle</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/11/12/die-kommende-kuendigungswelle.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2021 11:28:27 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/11/12/die-kommende-kuendigungswelle.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ein guter Freund sinnierte gestern mit anderen Freunden von mir über die Situation auf der Arbeit und schrieb mir heute:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wie man es auch dreht und wendet: Corona ist auch ein Lackmustest für Unternehmen in ihrer Rolle als Arbeitgeber.
Anhand der vierten Welle lässt sich das hervorragend nachvollziehen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denn Unternehmen und Organisationen, denen am Wohl ihrer Mitarbeiter/-innen etwas liegt, haben schon vor Wochen überall dort, wo es möglich ist, ihre Leute kategorisch wieder ins Homeoffice geschickt und Präsenzveranstaltungen untersagt.
Das hat selten etwas damit zu tun, dass diese Unternehmen herausragend schlau wären.
Viel mehr schauen diese Unternehmen sich ausgehend vom Wunsch, die eigenen Leute nicht zu gefährden, ihr Corona-Handling dort ab, wo es funktioniert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unternehmen beispielsweise, die sich an Israel orientieren, werden ihre Leute frühestens bei flächendeckender Booster-Impfung der eigenen Belegschaft wieder in die Büros rufen, falls überhaupt.
Unternehmen hingegen, die sich an den Richtlinien der deutschen Bundesregierung orientieren, pochen oft seit Wochen schon darauf, in die sich aufbauende vierte Welle hinein die Anwesenheitszeiten in den Büros zu erhöhen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist tragisch, weil es so vorhersehbar katastrophale wie vermeidbare Folgen haben wird.
Wer Leute notlos in den ÖPNV zwingt, obwohl sie nicht geboostert sind, exponiert sie unnötig einem erhöhten Risiko.
Wer Leute notlos ins Büro ruft, obwohl diese nicht impfbare Familienmitglieder im selben Haushalt haben, exponiert sie unnötig einem erhöhten Risiko.
Unternehmen, die so agieren, machen sich schuldig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Menschen in diesen Unternehmen sollten das Corona-Handling ihres Arbeitgebers jedenfalls genau beobachten.
Wer die Belegschaft unabhängig vom Impfstatus wieder ins Büro ruft, betreibt das Geschäft der Impfgegner.
Denn dann entsteht der Eindruck, der Impfstatus sei im Wesentlichen egal.
Wer nur geimpfte Menschen notlos ins Büro ruft, schafft dadurch indirekt sogar Incentives für Impfgegner, weil Homeoffice dann zu einem Privileg für diese wird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beides wäre unerträglich.
Und Menschen in diesen Firmen sollten ihren AG durchaus wissen lassen, dass das unerträglich ist.
Falls alle Stricke reißen:
Kündigen und Namen der Manager notieren, damit man in deren Fängen sicher nie mehr landet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bei den Amis heißt das &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Resignation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Great Resignation&lt;/a&gt;

:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has allowed workers to rethink their careers, work conditions, and long-term goals.
As many workplaces attempted to bring their employees in-person, workers desired the freedom to work from home given during the pandemic.
With telecommuting also came schedule flexibility, which was the primary reason to look for a new job of the majority of those studied by Bankrate in August 2021.
Additionally, many workers, particularly in younger cohorts, are seeking to gain a better work–life balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist die mildeste Formulierung, die ich gefunden habe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tatsächlich arbeiten &amp;ldquo;wir&amp;rdquo; im März 2022 seit 2 Jahren von zu Hause und/oder unter Pandemie-Bedingungen, und außerhalb der traditionellen Bürostrukturen und -hierarchien.
Einige Firmen haben sich anpassen können.
Von denen hat keine ein Problem mit Churn oder Hiring, also damit, Personal halten zu können und neues anzuwerben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es sind die Läden, die die Realität der vergangenen 2 Jahre negieren, die jetzt bluten, und zwar vom Kopfe her.
Und Mitarbeiter, die seit 2 Jahren bewiesen haben, daß sie sehr gut und erfolgreich arbeiten können,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ohne daß sie jeden Tag 2 Stunden im Berufsverkehr verschwenden,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ohne daß das Kind als Schlüsselkind nach Hause kommen muss,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ohne daß ihnen das Management auf die Bildschirme glotzt,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;und ohne daß sie 3 von 8 Stunden pro Tag in Meetings zu bringen, von denen für sie maximal 20 Minuten relevant sind,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;solche Leute brechen jetzt auf - in Firmen, die anders arbeiten, in Berufe, die das nicht notwendig machen oder in ein Umfeld, das weniger dem späten 19. Jahrhundert verhaftet ist. Die Zukunft der Arbeit ist gerade angekommen, und die Leute ziehen um.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerade bei den Wissensarbeitern ist das so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ich habe 5 Jahre studiert und danach 3 Jahre Projekte gemacht und Dir jetzt gerade 2 Jahre lang bewiesen, daß ich mich selbst organisieren kann, und jetzt willst Du mich im Büro haben, damit Du Dich nicht so alleine fühlst?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kann man machen. Nicht schlau. So gar nicht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; Nachtrag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jemand schickt mir diesen &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/overemployed-home-office-usa-1.5461910&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;paywalled link zur SZ&lt;/a&gt;

, von dem eh nur der Anreißer interessant ist. Der Artikel beschreibt unter dem Begriff &amp;ldquo;Overemployed&amp;rdquo; Personen, die im Homeoffice so effizient sind, daß sie zwei bezahlte Vollzeitstellen besetzen, ohne Wissen der jeweiligen Arbeitgeber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das geht natürlich nur mit &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;David Graeber&amp;rsquo;s Bullshit Jobs&lt;/a&gt;

, aber es ist natürlich auch ein Zeichen dafür, daß die Arbeit, die diese Personen ausführen weder produktiv, noch notwendig noch sinnstiftend ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ich antwortete mit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ich kann nur den Teaser lesen, aber das ist das, was wir im Informatik-Studium Semester 2 (und 4) gemacht haben.
Also 3 Leute in die Inf 2 Vorlesung schicken, parallel 3 Leute in Inf 4.
Mit dem Rest (gut 20 Leute, Rotationssystem) die Vorlesungen von 2x 90 Minuten in 45 Minuten durchziehen, und dann in 45 Minuten die Aufgaben machen.
Das hat sehr, sehr böses Blut gegeben&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Antwort war:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dafür hatten wir [bei uns] die Mitschriften AG. Etwas anderer Studienablauf bei Nicht-Informatikern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; Nachtrag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Einige Arbeitgeber insistieren dringend, daß &amp;ldquo;Mitarbeiter wenigstens einen Tag in der Woche im Büro sind&amp;rdquo;, ohne das näher zu begründen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bohrt man unauffällig und inoffiziell nach, heißt es &amp;ldquo;Wir haben sehr viele Expats, und wenn die statt von hier von ihrem Heimatland aus arbeiten, dann kommen wir von der Unternehmenssteuer her in Teufels Küche.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unter Umständen sollte man hier offener kommunizieren, und dann versuchen, kooperativ Lösungen zu finden, denn unerklärliches blockierendes Verhalten eines Arbeitgebers ist in diesem Zusammenhang nicht produktiv und führt wieder zur Kündigungswelle.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Vijzelbuurt is changing</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/10/08/vijzelbuurt-is-changing.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Oct 2020 18:11:50 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/10/08/vijzelbuurt-is-changing.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back when I was still commuting to work in an office, in the far past, I used to be in the Spaces building in Vijzelgracht in Amsterdam, every day. Mark Wagenbuur of &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/bicycledutch&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;BicycleDutch&lt;/a&gt;

 has been there today, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/BicycleDutch/status/1314213038908559361&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;

:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/BicycleDutch/status/1314213038908559361&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2020/10/bicycledutch-tweet.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amsterdam is changing dramatically. I was in Vijzelstraat for the first time in about 2 years and I was pleasantly surprised! Looked up the old situation in Google StreetView for some before and afters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also linked to &lt;a href=&#34;https://archief.amsterdam/beeldbank/detail/03429525-d56a-9371-d7ba-d3258ecdc8e3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;an image from the  Stadsarchief&lt;/a&gt;

 where the situation in 1987 is shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These works are documented on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amsterdam.nl/projecten&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;City of Amsterdam website&lt;/a&gt;

, which also has a page for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amsterdam.nl/projecten/vijzelstraat-herinrichting/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Vijzelstraat: herinrichting&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2020/10/vijzelstraat-goal.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The desired end state for the space in front of Spaces, Vijzelstraat 66.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The works are part of &lt;a href=&#34;https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rode_Loper_%28Amsterdam%29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Project Rode Loper&lt;/a&gt;

, which is the renewal and redesign of all urban space on top of the new Noord/Zuidlijn, Metro 52, after the completion of the Metro works in 2018. The Vijzelstraat works are the conclusion of this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The City of Amsterdam has a fabulous video channel on Youtube, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkq8uEQ0rl4NiJnO8mL7y_w&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Het Verkeer&lt;/a&gt;

, which announces and explains all street works and renewal. The Vijzelgracht project of course &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vu-ExAlzWE&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;also has a video&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vu-ExAlzWE&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2020/10/vijzelstraat-video.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video announcing the Vijzelstraat works.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly there are two more projects active that match and extend the Rode Loper in this area:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amsterdam.nl/projecten/vijzelgrachtgarage/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2020/10/vijzelgracht-garage.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amsterdam.nl/projecten/vijzelgrachtgarage/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Vijzelgracht: afbouw Vijzelgrachtgarage&lt;/a&gt;

 - The City is building a paid-for underground parking garage in the space between the metro station Vijzelgracht and the street level. This will provide paid-for parking space for 270 cars, similar to the Parkeergarage Museumskwartier, which is serving Frans-Hals-Buurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amsterdam.nl/projecten/vijzelbuurt-parkeerluw/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Vijzelbuurt: parkeerluw&lt;/a&gt;

 - Matching the extremely successful conversion of Frans-Hals-Buurt (around 500m north of Vijzelgracht), free and paid-for on street parking is almost completely removed, freeing up public space for fietsers, pedestrians, playing children and city green. The change will affect two local neighborhoods, Weteringbuurt and Noorderbuurt. The city has &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amsterdam.nl/projecten/vijzelbuurt-parkeerluw/nieuws-vijzelbuurt/ontwerpsessies-weteringbuurt/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;local consultations&lt;/a&gt;

 with the people living there right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;How do you solve reliable rollback. The definition of a reliable rollback being: &amp;lsquo;get reset &amp;ndash;hard &lt;ref&gt;&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;git push -f&amp;rsquo; and then magic happening that returns your infra to the exact state it was at &lt;ref&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is relatively easy to solve with modern infrastructure-as-code for anything that is stateless. It becomes a bit more involved when you are dealing with things with state, such as database instances or Zookeepers or similar things.&lt;/p&gt;

. I am basing my writeup on that reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;devops-what-does-that-even-mean&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#devops-what-does-that-even-mean&#34;&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Devops&amp;rdquo;, what does that even mean?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, I gave a talk titled &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2015/03/27/go-away-or-i-will-replace-you.html&#34;&gt;Go away, or I will replace you with a little shell script&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;rdquo; as a keynote for the GUUG FFG 2015 in Stuttgart. The german language slides are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.slideshare.net/isotopp/go-away-or-i-will-replace-you-with-a-little-shell-script&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;

, the english slides are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.slideshare.net/isotopp/go-away-of-i-will-replace-you-with-a-little-shell-script-english&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;

 and a Youtube video of the Froscon version of the talk is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CCv7pSK4s&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;

. Unfortunately, the video is the german language version of that talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk focuses on how the sysadmin profession started to die out somewhere around 2001, when we invented horizontal scaleout and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/yesthattom&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tom Limoncelli&lt;/a&gt;

 published the first edition of &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://the-sysadmin-book.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Practice of System Administration&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;rdquo;. That book explained in one chapter the role of the sysadmin in the greater corporate organisation and how to cooperate with, not fight against users. The term and the practice of Devops evolved in this decade, until in 2008 &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/patrickdebois&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Patrick Debois&lt;/a&gt;

 coined the actual term &amp;ldquo;Devops&amp;rdquo;, which we use today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term has been abused a lot, but what does it actually mean? In one slide I show this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.slideshare.net/isotopp/go-away-of-i-will-replace-you-with-a-little-shell-script-english#19&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2020/01/rolling-away.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Go away or I will replace you with a little Shell Script (english) - Slide 19&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern development environment according to Devops, and the technical meaning of the term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In todays language, I would phrase these items as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infrastructure as code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Version Control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CI/CD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Separation of Rollout and Activation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proper Observability with centralized, structured logs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good instant communication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Infrastructure As Code&lt;/em&gt; describes a way of declaring the execution environment for your code, in code. Code that can be checked in and versioned like the application code itself. Openstack Heat Scripts, AWS Cloud Formation, Kubernetes Deployment Specifications or your Terraform all qualify as this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this, you can recreate and redeploy your execution environment together with your application, as part of the build and deployment automation. It also means that you get rid of the endlessly fragile state manipulation engines that are Puppet, Ansible, Chef, Salt and CFEngine. You create, build and deploy images and you run immutable infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because all of that code and infrastructure declaration are files, you want &lt;em&gt;Version Control&lt;/em&gt;, which in 2020 means, you want all of this in git. This is so normal by now that anything that is not git-able is considered broken and weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you check in, you want to be processed automatically. So you push it through a &lt;em&gt;CI/CD pipeline&lt;/em&gt;, which pushes things through whatever pre-production environments you have (many have Dev, Staging and Prod). This, in 2020, probably includes formatting to coding standards, linting, sonarcubing, and whatever tests you wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, your code is rolled out. And a key invention - one that is not yet done by enough people - is &lt;em&gt;separation of Rollout and Activation&lt;/em&gt; by the means of an experiment framework. More on that below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When application code runs, it is appending messages, measurements and context to a hash of hashes. This collection will be pushed into an event processor at the end of a request. Ours is called &amp;ldquo;Booking Events&amp;rdquo;. If you happen to work elsewhere, an Observabilty tool such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://honeycomb.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Honeycomb.io&lt;/a&gt;

 is the closest to Booking Events I have been able to find outside of Booking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this, you alert and push alerts out through a multitude of channels, including Pagerduty, and whatever you use instead of Slack. Humans are being alerted to a situation, and can act on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;separation-of-rollout-and-activation-and-dual-use-experimentation&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#separation-of-rollout-and-activation-and-dual-use-experimentation&#34;&gt;
	Separation of Rollout and Activation, and Dual Use Experimentation
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, the separation of rollout and activation is a key invention that makes rollouts possible. It also makes testing in production safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first iteration, an experiment framework allows you to push code into production that never runs. You can then, through feature flags, activate your code for yourself, or a chosen subset of customers based on whatever selectors your frame work offers. I often quote &amp;ldquo;5% of the population of guest country .jp with a user-agent string that suggests MacOS&amp;rdquo; as an example, but it is really a function of the experiment framework you build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See a very old talk from 2012 of mine: &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.slideshare.net/isotopp/8-rollouts-a-day&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;8 rollouts a day&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qFNwNEeG1w&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;

) for an ancient take on all of this. This is not new technology, we have been doing this for ages, and just iterated on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having an experiment framework means that the scaffolding for activation in code is formalized and tested, so errors in gating entry to new code are unlikely to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also means that a control framework exists where you can see experiments that are active, who is exposed to them, and that participation in an experiment is recorded in a user click history. You probably want to record experiment config changes in your monitoring wallgraphs so that a change in observed behavior is linked to possible causes for that in an obvious and in-your-face way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also important for customer support: A CS agent needs to be able to see what the customers sees or has seen, if an experiment is a UI/UX experiment. UI/UX variants should be available to CS agents at will, so that they are able to match and retrace customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having experimentation available obviously means that variant code is in execution concurrently. Or in terms of rollouts: Old and new code run at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For state management, it means that schema changes or similar data adjustments need to be done in advance. They also need to be done in a way that is compatible with the old and the new code. That is not hard to do, and can be done in a robust testable way. You want to package it, and run a bunch of checks on schema changes automatically, so you can detect best practice violation and prevent these from being checked into staging and prod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, you need that table change framework anyway, because SOX will eventually want that from you. You probably will end up with a web frontend and API for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/LATEST/pt-online-schema-change.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;pt-online-schema-change&lt;/a&gt;

 accessible to end users in a way that also advises them automatically on best practice. This also scales better than your DBAs checking manually for the presence of a PK, NULLable columns, columns that are DOUBLE but suggest monetary values in their names, and similar things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, at this point you can push code into staging and prod in a way that the old and new variants of the code can coexist on whatever schema you have and can run concurrently, depending on what variant of which experiment the user is in. You can finally &lt;em&gt;activate&lt;/em&gt; code for a few users, and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your second iteration of the experiment framework will therefore measure the &lt;em&gt;impact&lt;/em&gt; of the experiment, and by that I do not only mean the business impact, but also the technical impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business impact measurements would answer questions such as &amp;ldquo;What influence has Experiment 17 on conversion?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Does variant B of experiment 17 not only improve conversion, but also customer support call rate, and if so, it is still a positive experiment in the monetary sense&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as a gate to the entry of code paths, the experiment framework can also encapsulate Probes that collect metrics over a Span, delivering technical measurements about the performance cost of an experiment. I can ask questions such as &amp;ldquo;Show me all messages in variant B of rollout 64fd32f that never appear when running variant A&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;What messages appear since rollout 64fd32f that did not appear before&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can also carry metrics and classify them by experiment related selectors. &amp;ldquo;Show me SQL time spent in variant B compared to variant A of rollout 64fd32f in all sections guarded by experiment 13, normalized by number of executions&amp;rdquo;. In other words, what exactly is the latency contribution of experiment 13b, since 64fd32f?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And because I have access to the unshortened, unaggregated raw event data persisted elsewhere, at any point in time I can ask the framework to actually show me the SQL, once I have a selector that finds me the delta I was looking for, and highlight the things that are only present here and not elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the Dual Use value of an experiment framework: You get the business value out of that, testing hypothesis on draft code in production before you spend engineering hours on things that aren&amp;rsquo;t going to make you richer. That is, in terms of bug stages, finding bugs in requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2020/01/rolling-relative-bugfix-cost.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.slideshare.net/isotopp/8-rollouts-a-day&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;8 rollouts a day (2012), Slide 19&lt;/a&gt;

: Relative cost of a bugfix in various stages of the code lifecycle. Fixing broken requirements is the cheapest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you also get the technical cost of that, in terms of running the prototype code. That enables you to assess the added execution cost vs. the estimated engineering effort to speed it up. In other words, your engineers only ever work on code that is proven to make you richer, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; you also know how much running it will cost you in AWS units or engineering hours and you can prioritise things properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, since A and B variants coexist, if B is known to be bad, you not only can roll that back, you don&amp;rsquo;t even have to. Simply turning off activation of B gives you instant silence in production - the known bad variant is still present, but never run for anybody. You can then triage and come up with a resolution of the situation on your own terms. Either you eliminate the B variant and roll back, or you fix B and roll forward. Either way, this is done completely out of the execution path and also without any time pressure constraints on the decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-sum-of-all-these-parts&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-sum-of-all-these-parts&#34;&gt;
	The Sum of All These Parts
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sum of these parts is much more than each individual capability gives you. Together they give you an environment that allows you to roll back and forward, at will. And you will be doing this in an informed way. You can reason about code in production, and act on the outcome of that discussion. And you are doing this outside of crisis mode and any time constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separation of Rollout and Activation is a Key Invention here. Put this into an Experimentation Framework, and create a dashboard/control/overview board around this that gives information about running and disabled experiments, experiment outcomes in terms of business and technical data, and that links to raw events and metrics generated from the raw events directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marrying an experiment framework + dashboard with a Honeycomb-like observability system, and with pointers to tags, releases and rollouts in your code base allows naviagation between all of these things in an integrated way. It enables product and tech people alike in a unique way to reason about code, what that code does to the business, UX, income, and also resource consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can direct business decisions, because it allows safe rapid development and deployment of draft business expierments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can direct engineering decisions, because it tells you what is safe, and what isn&amp;rsquo;t, what is good enough and what isn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It informs product management and backlog decisions, because it links technical cost, potential business income and resource usage cost so that business and tech reason about code at eye level - one single source of truth, and one single set of metrics spanning the lowest levels of tech to business metrics like conversion, cuca call rates, cancellations and other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After doing that a while, your code will be littered with Experiment Gateways that either protect and measure code that is full-on or perma-off. All of that code is technical debt and needs to be evaluated, and cleaned up. In this way, the experiment framework, even in the final stage of its usefulness acts as visual markup for technical debt assessment and as a guide for garbage code collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reliable-rollbacks-and-testing-in-production&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#reliable-rollbacks-and-testing-in-production&#34;&gt;
	Reliable Rollbacks and Testing In Production
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can even use this data to build predictors for expected business behavior, and alert on deviations. &amp;ldquo;According to observed growth and data from last year, last month and last week, we would expect x bookings per minute, but see m fewer, so something is likely wrong. That started 10 minutes ago at the yellow activation line of experiment 13&amp;rdquo; is a thing where I live, and turning off 13 before even looking for possible root causes is a complete no-brainer. In 95% of the cases or more it actually fixes the incident for now, so that any followup is done again outside of panic mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2020/01/rolling-production.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is: Testing In Production Is A Safe Thing To Do - if you build an environment that makes it survivable. The key ingredients are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Education&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Awareness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Empowerment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reference that in both talks I linked above: Education means you not only need your general craft, the IT you learned at school, in university or in previous jobs. You also need to learn the local knowledge. We encapsulate that in the two questions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you break it, will you even notice?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you break it, can you fix it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first question asks if you do know you dependencies and dependents for any subsystem that you change. If you don&amp;rsquo;t that&amp;rsquo;s okay, we will teach you. That&amp;rsquo;s why we are here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you write a patch, gate it in an experiment and then ask &amp;ldquo;Is this good? Can I roll that out?&amp;rdquo;, you are asking the wrong person. There is one expert on the whole planet for that change you just wrote, and that is you. You need to be able to answer the question &amp;ldquo;If you break it, will you even notice&amp;rdquo; with a confident yes in order to be admitted to production. Nobody but you will know the proper answer to that question, ever. We can only help you to find the &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo; by teaching you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a question of attitude, and it has to be coming from the top. Back in the day when &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/keeskoolen&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Kees&lt;/a&gt;

 was CEO, he usually ate with everybody else in the canteen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical conversation that happened similarly more than once is Kees asking somebody: &amp;ldquo;I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen you before. Are you new?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Yes, of course. I started 3 weeks ago.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;And&amp;rdquo;, Kees would ask, in one way or the other, &amp;ldquo;did you break production already?&amp;rdquo; The newbie would of course answer &amp;ldquo;No, of course not!&amp;rdquo; and get the usual response &amp;ldquo;So what am I paying you for?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moral in this is that errors and downtimes are a part of doing business. Of course we would like to have infrastructure where these things do not happen, or minimise impact, but velocity and risk taking are a thing of value to a fast company. By having an error budget (the integral between the predicted income and the actual income) and checking that things are within the error budget, management has a control that allows them to check on the state of the engineering culture. If we are over the error budget, we probably need to look at our ways, and the state of our education and practice. If we are under error budget a lot, we are probably not moving fast enough and are too risk averse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the instrumentation around this - CI/CD, dev and staging, experiment framework and observability framework - exist to make better use of the error budget and get most out of our invest into corporate improvement and organisational learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second question asks if you know how to fix the things that your change may break. It is not only a question about scope, but also a question about your network. That is, because in any reasonably large system you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to put it together alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should expect to need help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s people that help, not positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you should not answer &amp;ldquo;I will need a DBA around just in case&amp;rdquo;, but you should know if Debs, Greg or Simon would be better to have around in your case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With your education covered, and especially the necessary local knowledge amending your general education, you&amp;rsquo;d then have to be aware of your environment. That ties back to the upper part of this writeup. With probes and annotions from Spans covering Experiment gateways, you will have to access the data collected in your event logging system, your observability pipeline to understand the state and health of your system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is that exact state, and the detailed data that will tell you the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggregations are important, they point you into a general direction. But it is the raw data that contains the evidence you need. It is the ability to slice and dice the raw data along arbitrary dimensions at will that will allow you to make the precise cut which isolates the buggy cases from the non-buggy behavior. It will allow you to look at the precise delta in exposed state of your distributed system of dependencies that causes the abnormal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logs and metrics are good, essential for checks and alerts, to handle known cases and navigate known waters safely. Events, and the ability to search, sort, aggregate and correlate on events at will, are what enable you to see and debug a distributed and developing production system. Experiments, separation of rollout and activation, with integrated Probes in Spans, allow you to collect this data, and to act, by disabling code that introduces undesireable behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rollout is likely to be safe, because any new code you roll out is never executed in production. Unless you activate it. In the end you will find that it is not the rollout sparklines in your graphs that matter, it&amp;rsquo;s the config change sparklines that need watching. You can turn on things for yourself, for a subset of the population, or, if you have gradually built confidence, full on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full on (or full off and writing the change off as worthless, in 19 of 20 cases) is a precondition then for cleaning up: Removing either the Experiment tooling around one new codepath, removing the old codepath completely, or the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving experimentation instrumentation in the code, but having things full on (or off) is a very easy and visible way to assess technical debt. So even after the experiment has come to a conclusion one way or the other, the experiment framework is useful as a way to demarcate in some way or the other technical debt in source files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, empowerment. Empowerment is giving developers the power to make decisions, and at the same time demanding from them that they make them. You can do that only in a safe environment, and in a blame-free culture where this comes from the top. Hence the importance of Kees eating in the Canteen and asking the questions as told above. Hence, too, the importance of the error budget, and exposing it to all people that roll out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Jan 2019 09:14:19 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2019/01/07/du-weisst-nichts-von-homeoffice.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.golem.de/news/spd-arbeitsministerium-will-recht-auf-homeoffice-per-gesetz-1901-138520.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Recht auf Homeoffice&lt;/a&gt;

 schreibt Golem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das SPD-geführte Bundesarbeitsministerium plant ein gesetzlich verankertes Recht auf Home Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Und alle brüllen &amp;ldquo;Jaaaa!&amp;rdquo;.
Ich glaube, den meisten ist gar nicht klar, auf was sie sich da einlassen und wie sich eine Remote First-Firma anfühlt.
Wie dem auch sei:
Die Firma, in der Ihr gerade arbeitet, kann so mit Home Office vermutlich nicht gut funktionieren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ich habe von 2005 bis 2008 für MySQL AB gearbeitet, und das war eine Firma, die Remote First war.
Das war eine sehr andere Arbeitsumgebung als die, die ihr in Eurem Job vermutlich habt.
Wir waren circa 500 Mitarbeiter in drei Dutzend Ländern überall auf der Erde.
Es gab einen Firmensitz in Kalifornien und einen irgendwo in Skandinavien, aber dort war nie jemand (im Büro in Kalifornien waren ein paar Leute mehr, weil die dort den Börsengang der Firma vorbereitet haben).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Als Mitarbeiter hatte man einen gesonderten Raum daheim zu haben, der als Büro dient.
Die Firma hat einen gewissen Betrag pro Jahr (2500 Euro) bereitgestellt, um diesen Raum auszustatten oder zu verbessern.
Das schließt Arbeitsmaterial (Laptop) wie Büroausstattung (Stuhl, Tisch, etc pp) mit ein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weil es faktisch keine Firmenräume gab, gab es auch kein Firmen-VPN, denn das hätte den Zugang erschwert.
Stattdessen gab es einen Haufen Webdienste, über die die Kommunikation stattfand.
Diese waren verschlüsselt und mit einem Single Sign On versehen, aber generell von überall zugänglich von wo aus man eine TLS Verbindung bekommen konnte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alle Diskussionen, internen Abstimmungen, Meetings, und Ergebnisse wurden über diese Webdienste, Skype, IRC und andere Online-Medien getroffen.
Die Arbeitszeiten waren oft schräg, weil die Firma über alle Zeitzonen der Erde verteilt war.
Und das heißt, man mußte schon mal um 3 Uhr morgens ran, um ein Meeting mit Leuten in Shanghai, Moskau und in Kalifornien gleichzeitig zu haben &amp;ndash; da gibt es einfach keine gute Zeitzone für alle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meetings über Videokonferenzen und Chatmedien sind schwierig, und Diskussionen über Mailinglisten sind oft hitzig und schwerfällig zugleich.
Es war notwendig, bestimmte Formen zu entwickeln und mit Leuten einzuüben.
Wenn man Leute aus einem Präsenzumfeld in eine Home Office Umgebung wirft, sind sie zunächst orientierungslos, unter Druck und einsam gleichzeitig.
Sie müssen an die Hand genommen werden, und man muß Ihnen Methoden und Formen aktiv zeigen, die ihnen erlauben, in so einer Umgebung zu funktionieren und sinnvoll zu kommunizieren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am schwierigsten ist der Umgang mit der Tatsache, daß es keine Serendipität und keine aufwandslose Kommunikation gibt.
Diese Dinge, die man in Präsenzfirmen &amp;ldquo;nebenbei&amp;rdquo; mitbekommt, seitwärts, top-down und bottom-up, kommen in Home Office First Firmen nicht nebenbei.
Jeder, Management, Teamleiter, aber auch jeder einzelne Mitarbeiter, müssen lernen, daß jede Kommunikation einen Aufwand und Energie kostet, und man sich das Messaging genau überlegen muß.
Tut man das nicht, wird Zusammenhalt und gerichtete Aktion einem Firmenverbandes schwierig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zentral in MySQL waren übrigens die verschiedenen All Hands und Department Meeting Veranstaltungen.
Zweimal im Jahr hat sich gesamte Firma an einem Ort getroffen (meistens ein Fünf Sterne Hotel in einem gut erreichbaren Land mit entspannter Visa-Situation, in der Nachsaison), und zweimal im Jahr haben sich gesamte Abteilungen getroffen.
Auf diesen Events (jeweils drei bis fünf Tage) haben wir uns kennengelernt, ein Netzwerk aufgebaut, zusammen Kurzprojekte (&amp;ldquo;Hackathon&amp;rdquo;) durchgezogen und natürlich auch gefeiert.
Zusammen mit anderen Treffen hatte man so in etwa alle zwei Monate ein Gruppen-, Abteilungs-, oder Firmentreffen.
Alles in allem nicht wirklich eine Verbesserung der finanziellen und der CO2-Bilanz, aber notwendig um eine funktionierende Gruppe zu schaffen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;seriously-hr-people-ask-the-weirdest-questions&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#seriously-hr-people-ask-the-weirdest-questions&#34;&gt;
	Seriously, HR people ask the weirdest questions.
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Where do you see yourself in five years?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a Twentysomething with no owned property and no family the
truthful answer is of course &amp;ldquo;In a different company, twice
removed. Not because you suck more than anywhere else, but,
like, statistically.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/LionKingLee/status/906220573637971968&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2017/09/five-years.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Where do you see yourself in five years?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Week 27 or 28?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/LionKingLee/status/906220573637971968&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;LionKingLee&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That time when you finish school and university and before you
settle down with dependencies that make you immobile - it is an
important time in your life. Use it wisely: Change jobs every
two to three years, and make it count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is: understand that the people you work with are more
important than the companies you work for - you are building
your professional network. The companies you work for will
change every few years, but the network you build will be with
you for the rest of your life. It will be an important part of
you and your career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These people you are with in your wild years, they are the
people who will recommend you to the company you are aiming for
next. They will make sure that your CV is at least read, if you
send it there. They will make sure that you have at least the
first interview with that new shop. They are the people who will
ask you, when they have a professional question regarding your
area of expertise, and who will listen to your recommendations -
for hiring, for purchase, or just for grounding some goofball
ideas which may or may not turn into a startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;seriously-hr-people-have-the-weirdest-ideas&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#seriously-hr-people-have-the-weirdest-ideas&#34;&gt;
	Seriously, HR people have the weirdest ideas.
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met some once, who were wondering why self-assessment and 360º
reviews and management reviews diverge so much. There are things
like
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.impraise.com/team-performance-analytics/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;

 for
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.impraise.com/feedback-behaviour-report/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;


(and that&amp;rsquo;s already one of the better solutions).
But you are effectively typing feedback about your future
network peers into a SaaS solution, and you know that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there is a third party company which collects data about me
at work, and what others think about me. This company may or may
not keep it around when we leave our current engagement,
depending on legislation, this companies operational skills and
culture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you trust a company with an Uber-like culture with this data?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you know if they are an Uber or not? If they keep it, and
they are successful in their market, they will build a profile
over my networks and my entire career, over each of our
professional engagements over time. Yeah, one more profile to
worry about, on top of the Google shadow, the Github and the
Linkedin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, back when I was 20 (that was 1988), I learned the value
of feedback - it is what helps you grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I also learned that negative feedback is always delivered over
coffee and beer, privately, face to face, and never, ever,
written down.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially not in some random 3rd parties SaaS interface.
You have no idea where it is going to end up, how long it is
being kept or who is going to buy whom in the end. So, anything
that goes into reports and reviews will of course be formatted
in a way such that it does not damage the current and future
relationship between my network and me. It&amp;rsquo;s not real and can&amp;rsquo;t
ever be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that was true already before systems like these, when HR was
still working with paper folders and kept data in-house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;seriously-hr-people-have-the-weirdest-jobs&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#seriously-hr-people-have-the-weirdest-jobs&#34;&gt;
	Seriously, HR people have the weirdest jobs.
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever technology you build, theirs can&amp;rsquo;t be automated, and in
many ways not even effectively assisted.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The company as a social engine</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/08/07/the-company-as-a-social-engine.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:34:37 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/08/07/the-company-as-a-social-engine.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So why is everything so complicated? At work, I mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of a small company. A single person, a founder, is building her
business. She knows her way around, it&amp;rsquo;s all in her head: The plan, the
things that are important and why, and how they are to be executed. Also,
tradeoffs to be corrected later, potential opportunities for later and a lot
of other meta: Stuff that does not get executed right now, but that informs
decisions, priorities and preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things work with some precision, though, like a well programmed wetware CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment that stuff becomes too large for a single person to handle, more
people are involved and things need to be verbalized, written down, given
form. At that point, things change quite a bit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The task at hand is to program a second CPU, wetware, with a part of the
program that the first person has been executing. That&amp;rsquo;s necessary so she
can delegate, and the entire operation can scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as with all remote procedure call mechanisms, complicated
unfolded in-memory structures have to serialized before the can be
marshalled off to a second node and are being re-instantiated over there. In
this particular case, the language to describe the code to be executed is
informally specified, too, and the remote CPU also does not match the specs
of the first CPU, that is, English is really bad for programming computers
or people, and also each person is different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse there is no proper debugger, the same broken language
has to be used to printf-debug the remote (&amp;ldquo;Do you understand what I mean?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Do you understand why it is important that we do things this way?&amp;rdquo;) and
there may be other, older code in the remote that interferes with the
execution of our code. People have history and they have ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think of a company as a large distributed engine to execute code that
has been extracted painfully and incompletely from the wetware engine of a
founder, and which has been mangled due to improper serialization in a
language with limited expressiveness, you have a good idea of the corporate
environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t see what happens in the individual nodes, you can only observe the
communication between them, and the parts of the program that made it into
writing, or at least the Wiki. You can think of processes as written down
instructions for the engine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any process (&amp;ldquo;buy more paperclips&amp;rdquo;) describes who needs to talk to whom,
about what and why, in order to make things happen (&amp;ldquo;You need to create a
purchase order, which needs to be signed by &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; for values over &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; EUR in
order to limit our liability. The signed order is then sent to &lt;em&gt;Z&lt;/em&gt;, who will
actually spend money to buy stuff. You get stuff, and sign here to document
that.&amp;rdquo;)
Writing instructions and process down is important, and a great improvement
actually, because writing these instructions down forces all involves
parties (including the founders) to come clear about all the details and the
meta about the details - things that might have been existing only vaguely
in some mind, previously, now have to get a precise shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, they become tangible, and by the way of tangibility, they are open to
challenge, discussion and modification - which is why some founders are
actually resisting to give tangible form to certain things. Giving tangible
shape to instructions and the meta - why instructions, why these
instructions, why these instructions in this order with these emphasis - is
a complicated, painful and slow process, precisely because the originator of
an idea - the founder or some other person with an idea - has to give up the
idea and let it out into the world, where it will be subjected to change by
others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loss of control is always violent and painful, and as with any new thing
given a permanent form, there is always negotiation about the details.
Giving birth to anything: It&amp;rsquo;s exhausting. It&amp;rsquo;s not a one step process. A
founder has an idea and a plan, but in many parts it is still early,
untested and vague.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They put things into words, and the words are being tried out - can we work
by these instructions, or are there things unclear? Can the instructions
work, or does the plan need change? Can it be improved? Can it be applied to
other, similar things? Iterations happen. Do we go deep or wide - do we
specialize and improve this application of a plan, or do we try to apply the
plan as is to as many things as possible first?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, negotiation, and consequently, exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why is everything so complicated? Because companies are broken. All of
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their engine, their program, their processes, are magnifications of the mind
of the founder or other influential people at the top. The entire corporate
mechanism is built to do exactly this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with this mechanism not only the original idea is being magnified and
copied to many minds, but other aspects of the original mind are, too. And
because the source was a person, with flaws, they too, are being magnified
and multiplied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you like it around here? Well, that&amp;rsquo;s because like all corporate
environments, this one is broken, too. It just so happens that the breakage
around here is more compatible with your own flaws than elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, your work environment sucks. They all do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find the one that sucks in a way that suits your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Twitter so: Testing in Production</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/08/01/twitter-so-testing-in-production.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2017 09:25:02 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/08/01/twitter-so-testing-in-production.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/matthewrdutton/status/892007581639737344&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Matthew Dutton:&lt;/a&gt;


»@mipsytipsy I thought &amp;ldquo;You have to test in production&amp;rdquo; was a bold statement
and would love to hear more of your thoughts on the
topic.«&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy/status/892048269651484672&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Charity Majors:&lt;/a&gt;


»Hmmm, you&amp;rsquo;re not the only one to call this out. I&amp;rsquo;ll add it to my list of
&amp;ldquo;articles to write someday&amp;rdquo; ? but here&amp;rsquo;s the gist: We have always tested in
production, just not well. And obviously, I&amp;rsquo;m not advising anyone to do
&lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; of the usual pre-production testing methods, but at some point, esp
with distributed systems, you just can&amp;rsquo;t usefully mimic the qualities of
size and chaos that tease out the long thin tail of bugs. Imagine trying to
spin up a staging copy of Facebook, or the national electrical grid! You
can&amp;rsquo;t, and have sharply diminished returns. If you can catch 80-90% of the
bugs with 10-20% the effort (and you can), the rest is more usefully poured
into making production resilient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[How do you do testing in production?] Canarying; automated canarying and
promotion in stages; empowering your developers to explore live production
systems with e.g. @honeycombio (hi), making rollbacks wicked fast and
reliable; instrumentation; education and training, feature flags a la
@launchdarkly. all great use of time. Basically what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to say is,
embrace failure. Get used to the inevitability and lean into it, &lt;em&gt;iff&lt;/em&gt; you
have a system like this. If you&amp;rsquo;ve got a rails app and five engineers then
ignore everything I&amp;rsquo;m saying until the moment is right :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/f3ew/status/892277138329612289&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Devdas Bhagat:&lt;/a&gt;

 »Just
tagging potental speakers who know a bit about that topic.«&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/isotopp/status/892281239109083136&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Kristian Köhntopp:&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decouple rollout and activation (feature flags, experiment framework)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low latency monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor the shit out of everything&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement schema changes with old and new version being live simultaneously&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each change, know your providers, know your consumers Strategy: Make testing in
production as safe as you can possibly make it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That has manifold returns: It makes developers production aware; builds
knowledge in handling real catastrophes in regular operational situations;
builds confidence and competence; you get actual measurements, which is good
calibration. In general, you build antifragility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing in Production also allows testing of features for commercial
viability fast, before you invest lots of development resources to build
them out. So it enables you to throw away 95% of the code before it is
written. That&amp;rsquo;s actually the most valuable part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content slightly edited to make it easier to read.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rolling out patches and changes, often and fast</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fefe had a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.fefe.de/?ts=a7e82d0e&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;short pointer&lt;/a&gt;

 to an article
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smb/blog/2017-05/2017-05-12.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Patching is Hard&lt;/a&gt;

.
It is, but you can make it a lot easier by doing a few things right. I did s small
writeup (&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.fefe.de/?ts=a7e262f4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;in German&lt;/a&gt;

) to explain this,
which Fefe posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have an older talk on this, titled &amp;ldquo;8 rollouts a day&amp;rdquo; (more like
30 these days). There are
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.slideshare.net/isotopp/8-rollouts-a-day&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;

 and a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzU1UtUpyTI&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;recording&lt;/a&gt;

. The Devops talk
&amp;ldquo;Go away or I will replace you with a little shell script&amp;rdquo; addresses it,
too, but from a different angle
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.slideshare.net/isotopp/go-away-of-i-will-replace-you-with-a-little-shell-script-english&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;

,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CCv7pSK4s&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;recording&lt;/a&gt;

).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the english version of my writeup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smb/blog/2017-05/2017-05-12.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Patching is Hard&lt;/a&gt;

 article
says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patching is hard? Yes—and every major tech player, no matter
how sophisticated they are, has had catastrophic failures when
they tried to change something. Google once bricked
Chromebooks with an update. A Facebook configuration change
took the site offline for 2.5 hours. Microsoft ruined network
configuration and partially bricked some computers; even their
newest patch isn&amp;rsquo;t trouble-free. An iOS update from Apple
bricked some iPad Pros. Even Amazon knocked AWS off the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where I am working we made the same observation. 100% uptime is
impossible, but management needs metrics and controls to
understand if we are still on the right track. We do have an
outage budget. That means we are measuring the actual current
business and compare with the predicted business. If a failed
rollout creates a loss of (potential) income, we can tell how
much that is and deduct that from the outage budget. We are
trying to make the budget as precisely as possible. That does
not mean we are trying to create outages on purpose, but having
fewer outages than the budget allows may mean that we are not
moving fast enough and have become complacent in what we are
doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rolling out often is useful, because then change sets are small
and easy to check, much easier than large and hard to understand
changes. So we do need to roll out often in order to maintain
speed. Rollout problems tend to manifest in subsystems where we
do not roll out often enough. Usually secondary changes, changes
in dependencies and libraries, accumulate and then the rollout
fails. The solution is to roll out even if the code did not
change (that is, we roll out for the sake of keeping
dependencies current).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very tangible form of representing technical debt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the larger the diff between production and trunk is, the more
likely moving trunk to production is going to result in a
failure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To make patching safe you have to do it often.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To be able to patch often, you need to make patching and
rolling out an operative process and not an upgrade/migration
project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To make rollouts and operative thing it is useful to
make testing in production safe and survivable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To be able to test in production, the following things are
useful:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have at most two versions of a change to a certain system.
Do not do three phase or multiphase rollouts. Finish one
change before you do the next one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have overcapacity. A change might make it necessary to
provide more machinery or more computer power or more memory
for a short time. You need to have that or be able to
provision this on short notice. Being efficient means having
no reserves, no elasticity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;separation of code distribution and code activation. That means feature
flags and experiments in your code. The same rollout must be
able to switch at runtime between old and new behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;changes to persistent data structures require that you update both
versions of the structure concurrently in order for old and
new code to be able to co-exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you need to know what is going on. Have a good monitoring, central log
collection, good search on all of that. There is a thing
called monitoring lag, the distance in time between a thing
happening and the time you will see this in your monitoring.
Measure that lag and have it shown on each screen. Alert on
monitoring lag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have a culture of failure that focuses on improvement and
learnings. Check out the search term &amp;ldquo;blameless postmortem&amp;rdquo;
and read up on this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not actually rocket science, but it will make things a lot better
around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stört euch bitte nicht an dem Denglisch, das ist in der Ops-Abteilung von
internationalen Firmen durchaus normal :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed. The office is in Amsterdam, and the language at work is English.
When I am thinking about work, I am doing it in English. Writing about work
in German means that I will use a lot of english terms for the things I am
trying to describe, because I&amp;rsquo;d have to search for appropriate German terms
and concepts first and that would interrupt the flow. Sorry about that.&lt;/p&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where I work we have regular round tables, in
which you can talk and ask questions to middle management from other
departments than your own. I had the opportunity to talk to a person who
manages development priorities and staffs teams, and who of course has some
insight into hiring and the interview process. That was very enlightening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, finding people to hire in a large organisation is a hard job.
Hiring rates are quite fixed, so in order to find people to hire you need to
go through a relatively fixed, larger number of resume reviews, phone
screens and face to face interviews. Assume that for each three people you
would want to hire you need to sift through 100 resumes - that&amp;rsquo;s 10.000
resumes to look at for 300 people to hire. And it can not be automated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interview process for hiring, then moving people and their families, and
finally on-boarding has latency - several months, often half a year, until
the move and first day at work, and then another three months of on-boarding
and three more months of team formation (the four *ormings).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with whiteboard programming being a useless exercise in hiring
interviews, and prefer other methods to validate credentials and capability -
I like to ask people &amp;ldquo;Choose a previous project from your resume and tell
me about it. What was that about, what was hard, and how did you handle
this? What did you like about your solution, and what would you be doing
differently in retrospective?&amp;rdquo; I like to hear about things they are proud
of, and things they have learned, and I like to hear about possible choices
and reasons for preferring one over the other. But this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your email. I&amp;rsquo;m very interested indeed. I have nothing against
an interview. However, there is one condition: I have to be interviewed by
the person I will be working for. By my future direct manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is not going to work in any larger organisation, and for sure not in the
place I work in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t hire for a specific position, except for very few and distinct job
profiles. Certainly not for developer positions.&amp;rdquo; has been explained to me.
&amp;ldquo;We would for example hire for specific positions in deep infra, Network
Engineers or Database Administrators, but that&amp;rsquo;s rare and an exception.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked for the why, we ended speaking about one core work of that
manager, and how an agile organisation at scale can work. In our case, the
organisation has a very specific culture and way of working, and of course a
huge established codebase. The purpose of on-boarding is to explain our way
of working and our past choices to beginners, and to familiarise them with
our vocabulary, toolset and environment in a safe way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After completing this, beginners like everyone else, can enter the &amp;ldquo;Pick
your next team&amp;rdquo; process, in which wishes and requests, skills and interests
are being matched, and in which people can move laterally through the
organisation. It may very well be that the job and team you are applying for
after completing on-boarding did not exist yet when you were interviewed -
and in fact that&amp;rsquo;s not entirely unlikely, considering growth and the speed
of change in the business environment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Automatisierung und Skalierung - Teil 2</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2011/02/18/automatisierung-und-skalierung-teil-2.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2011 20:47:49 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2011/02/18/automatisierung-und-skalierung-teil-2.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dies ist der 2. Teil zum Thema Automatisierung von Systemverwaltungsaufgaben.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2011/02/17/automatisierung-und-skalierung.html&#34;&gt;Den ersten Teil gibt es hier&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In jenem Text habe ich mit dem Beispiel eines Installationsservers gearbeitet und ich schrieb darüber:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was also wie ein wenig Gescripte aussieht, ist in Wirklichkeit die
Definition und Realisierung eines Prozesses - genau genommen die
Formalisierung eines Prozesses &amp;ldquo;Server aufsetzen&amp;rdquo; in der Firma. Das Ziel
des Prozesses ist die Produktion einer neuen Maschine, die einer gewissen
Spezifikation möglichst gut entsprechen soll. Dabei sind die Prozeßziele
die möglichst genaue Einhaltung der Spezifikation, und die möglichst
schnelle Abwicklung des Auftrages. Dabei ist das Wissen eines Experten in
Programmcode auskristallisiert worden - den Hilfs-Scripten und Anpassungen
des Installationsservers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ich muß die wichtigen Punkte hier noch einmal herausstellen: Wenn wir in
einem Umfeld solche Aufgaben automatisieren, dann wollen wir damit
verschiedene Dinge erreichen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zum einen soll die gewünschte Operation, etwa die Installation einer Kiste,
reproduzierbar gemacht werden. Das kann nur dann gelingen, wenn die
Automatisierung dieses Prozesses vollständig ist, &lt;em&gt;die Anzahl der manuellen
Arbeitsschritte zur Nachbearbeitung also Null ist&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denn wenn während einer solchen Änderung an einer Maschine auch nur ein
Arbeitsschritt von Hand durch einen Sysadmin ausgeführt wird, dann besteht
die Gefahr, daß diese Änderung nicht korrekt oder uneinheitlich gemacht
wird, und das gefährdet die nachfolgenden automatischen
Bearbeitungssschritte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Außerdem geht die Parallelisierbarkeit der Operation verloren, wenn noch
manuelle Arbeitsschritte notwendig sind: Egal wie viele Kisten wir
zeitgleich durch den Prozeß ziehen können, am Ende müssen die manuellen
Schritte nacheinander Kiste für Kiste durch einen menschlichen Admin
abgearbeitet werden, sind also wieder serialisiert. Das heißt, es gibt einen
Punkt, der vermutlich gar nicht so weit draußen liegt, an dem der ganze
Prozeß wieder bottlenecked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Und schließlich ist es so, daß wir durch die Automatisierung einer Operation -
hier der Installationsprozeß  - das notwendige Expertenwissen zur
Durchführung in ein Script verpacken. Das Wissen um das &amp;ldquo;Wie&amp;rdquo; wird
externalisiert, damit reproduzierbar und einem Diskurs (durch Patches)
zugänglich gemacht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baut man da noch eine schöne Bedienoberfläche drüber, hat man die Operation
sogar produktisiert: Sie kann nun durch Personal ausgelöst werden, das von
den Details nichts mehr weiß und wissen muß und daher niedriger qualifiziert
sein kann als das Personal, das den Prozeß entwickelt hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/automatisierter_prozess.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der automatisierte Prozeß und seine Ziele/Effekte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zieht man das konsequent durch, bekommt man innerhalb des Systembetriebes
eine Trennung zwischen Personen, die Systeme bedienen (&amp;ldquo;Operator&amp;rdquo;) und
Personen, die Prozesse automatisieren, indem sie die Interfaces für
Operatoren und die Funktionalität dahinter bauen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Letztere Gruppe entwickelt Programme, genau wie die Entwickler in der
Entwicklungsabteilung - es sind Entwickler
(&lt;a href=&#34;http://teddziuba.com/2010/10/taco-bell-programming.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;auch wenn es Leute gibt, die das bestreiten&lt;/a&gt;


und die meinen, das Gescripte da sei keine richtige Programmierung).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solche Entwickler bauen Code zur automatisierten Systemverwaltung, also
Infrastruktur, im Gegensatz zu den regulären Entwicklern, die an neuen
Features bauen. Daher nenne ich die einen Infrastrukturentwickler und die
anderen Featureentwickler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andere Leute nennen das
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jedi.be/blog/2010/02/12/what-is-this-devops-thing-anyway/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;DevOps&lt;/a&gt;

,
und integrieren die Infrastrukturentwickler tiefer in die
Featureentwicklung, die dann die Belange von Operations gleich bei der
Entwicklung der Software von Anfang an mit berücksichtigen soll. Ich halte
das nicht unbedingt für glücklich, weil die geforderten Qualifikationen
andere sind, und weil die Denkweise des Infrastrukturentwicklers eine andere
ist als die eines Featureentwicklers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Featureentwickler, insbesondere im Bereich der agilen Methoden, sind ein
wenig wie Teletubbies - sie sind timeboxed, und wenn bestimmte Dinge beim
Ablaufen der Timebox nicht fertig werden, dann werden diese Features eben
gekippt und auf ein späteres Release verschoben. Das macht aber nix, denn
man kann die Features, die fertig geworden sind, schon mal releasen und die
Leute, die das gebaut haben, trotzdem loben: Ui, das habt ihr aber fein
gemacht und so schön bunt! Oder anders gesagt: Auch schon für Teil-Lösungen
gibt es oft einen inkrementellen Payoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Im Bereich der Infrastrukturentwicklung gibt es das eher nicht, eben genau
wegen der Anforderung &amp;ldquo;genau Null manuelle Eingriffe&amp;rdquo;. Für viele Aufgaben
funktioniert timeboxing hier nicht, sondern man muß die Aufgabe ganz,
komplett und vollständig erledigen, erst dann kann man das erste Mal
wirklich Gewinne durch die Erledigung der Aufgabe einstreichen - dann aber
auch gleich in voller Höhe. Die Führung eines Teams von
Infrastrukturentwicklern muß daher eher militärisch erfolgen: Klar
definierte und abgegrenzte Ziele, dann rein, die Mission erledigen und
wieder raus, keine halben Sachen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daher ist in der Infrastrukturentwicklung
&lt;a href=&#34;http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Scrum&lt;/a&gt;

 eine Methode, die eventuell nicht
passend ist - schon gar nicht, wenn auf der Prioritätenliste Featureentwicklung mit
Infrastrukturentwicklung um Prioritäten kämpft. Denn Scrum limitiert die
Arbeit pro Iteration durch das  &lt;a href=&#34;http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum#Selected_Backlog&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Selected Backlog&lt;/a&gt;

,
und da Featureentwicklung dem Betrieb direkt Einnahmen bringt, während
Infrastrukturentwicklung in vielen eher als Geldsenke gesehen wird, führt
das schnell dazu, daß jede Menge
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Technical Debt&lt;/a&gt;

 aufgebaut wird,
d.h. wichtige Infrastrukturarbeit liegen bleibt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man kann versuchen, da mit
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_inversion&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Priority Inversion&lt;/a&gt;


drum herum zu arbeiten, d.h. daß Infrastrukturprojekte die Priorität der
Featureprojekte erben, für die sie Vorbedingung zur Realisierung sind, aber
meiner persönlichen Erfahrung nach wird das nicht strikt genug gehandhabt.
Außerdem verhindert es proaktive Infrastrukturarbeiten, und rein reaktive
Systemadministration ist ein sehr steiler Weg ins Chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aber auch wenn Infrastrukturentwicklung von der Featureentwicklung getrennt
ist, etwa weil eine Trennung von Operations und Development existiert, ist
Scrum oft nicht die geeignete Methode, da Timeboxing bei einer
Aufgabenstellung nicht so gut funktioniert, die erst dann Gewinne bringt,
wenn die Aufgabe 100% erledigt ist. Besser verwendet man eine
&lt;a href=&#34;http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_in_der_IT#Unterschiede_zwischen_Kanban_und_Scrum&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Kanban&lt;/a&gt;

-Variante
und paßt diese dann auf die lokalen Erfordernisse der Organisation und die
Mentalität des Teams an.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/greenhopper.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jira Greenhopper Extension mit der Darstellung eines Migrationsprojektes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setzt man das um, stellt man binnen 6 bis 12 Monaten fest, daß sich die Art
der Aufgaben und der geforderten Qualifikationen innerhalb des ehemaligen
Sysadmin-Teams sehr verschieben. Zwar sind immer noch Kenntnisse von
bestimmten Subsystemen und ihrer Arbeitsweise notwendig, aber die neu
geschaffenen Infrastrukturentwickler brauchen tatsächlich Kenntnisse einer
(interpretierten) Programmiersprache (PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby) im Gegensatz
zu einer Scriptsprache (Shell) - genau genommen wird man sich im Team auf
eine gemeinsame Plattformsprache einigen müssen, ein gemeinsames Repository
haben, und auch sonst eine ganze Menge Dinge vereinheitlichen müssen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Arbeitsweise des Teams ändert sich ebenfalls - wenn die Umstellung
gelingt, wird sich nach Ablauf des ersten Jahres kein Sysadmin mehr auf
einer Kiste einloggen müssen, weil ssh von func, puppet, LDAP und einer
Datenbank zum Konfigurationsmanagement abgelöst worden ist.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Automatisierung und Skalierung</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2011/02/17/automatisierung-und-skalierung.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2011 17:09:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2011/02/17/automatisierung-und-skalierung.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ich hatte im Vorfeld der OSDC 2011 eine interessante Unterhaltung mit Julian
Hein zum Thema Automatisierung. Er wollte, daß ich einmal erkläre, warum man
das eigentlich tut - und was man da eigentlich tut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Antwort ist ein wenig länger, und weil ich dieses Jahr nicht zur OSDC
fahren kann und dort auch nicht reden kann, will ich einmal versuchen,
meinen Text zumindest in groben Zügen hier aufzuschreiben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Zusammenfassung ist jedenfalls, daß Automatisierung kein technisches
Problem ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aber von vorne:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ich komme von MySQL, aus einem Consultingumfeld, und ich habe dort mit
Kunden in jeder möglichen Betriebsgröße zu tun gehabt - von einzelnen MySQL
Servern hin bis zu Leuten, die wirklich große Setups am Laufen gehabt haben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darum habe ich mich vor Jahren im Vorfeld der MySQL Enterprise Manager (MEM,
&amp;ldquo;Merlin&amp;rdquo;) Entwicklung auch mit dem Merlin-Team unterhalten und versucht zu
erklären, was ich mir unter einem &amp;ldquo;Enterprise Manager&amp;rdquo; denn so vorstelle und
wieso. Die Entwicklung ist dann aus einer ganzen Reihe von inzwischen
hinfällig gewordenen betriebsinternen Gründen ganz anders gelaufen, aber das
ist eine andere Geschichte, die ein anderes Mal erzählt werden soll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inzwischen bin ich in einer Firma, die noch vor drei oder vier Jahren eine
gerade eben zweistellige Gesamtanzahl von Servern am Laufen hatte, und deren
Maschinenpark sich jetzt im vierstelligen Bereich bewegt - mit einer großen
dreistelligen Anzahl von MySQL-Instanzen. Ohne Automatisierung könnten wir
das mit der vorhandenen Anzahl von Personen gar nicht stemmen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aber Automatisierung ist mehr, als einfach nur einen Haufen Scripte zu
schreiben, die dann Aufgaben übernehmen, obwohl es wohl in den meisten
Firmen so anfängt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zum Beispiel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jemand muß einen Server zum wiederholten Male installieren, oder schlimmer
noch, einer anderen Person erklären, wie man &amp;ldquo;bei uns&amp;rdquo; Server installiert,
also was unter allen möglichen Wahlmöglichkeiten die Entscheidungen und
Designideen sind, die &amp;ldquo;bei uns&amp;rdquo; getroffen wurden und wieso.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Läden, die ein wenig schlauer arbeiten, geht das meistens mit der
Installation eines Installservers einher, und so kann man Kisten dann aus
dem Netz booten, und sie malen sich dann ein Betriebssystem und einen Haufen
Zusatzsoftware und Konfiguration auf die Platte. Dabei werden dann noch mehr
Entscheidungen und Überlegungen getroffen, die durch den automatisierten
Installationsprozeß umgesetzt werden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was also wie ein wenig Gescripte aussieht, ist in Wirklichkeit die
Definition und Realisierung eines Prozesses - genau genommen die
Formalisierung eines Prozesses &amp;ldquo;Server aufsetzen&amp;rdquo; in der Firma. Das Ziel des
Prozesses ist die Produktion einer neuen Maschine, die einer gewissen
Spezifikation möglichst gut entsprechen soll. Dabei sind die Prozeßziele die
möglichst genaue Einhaltung der Spezifikation, und die möglichst schnelle
Abwicklung des Auftrages. Dabei ist das Wissen eines Experten in
Programmcode auskristallisiert worden - den Hilfs-Scripten und Anpassungen
des Installationsservers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die weitere Diskussion über den Prozeß findet in Form von Patches zu diesem
Code ihren Niederschlag - zwar redet man über den Prozeß und wie man ihn
verändern, anpassen oder erweitern will, aber keine dieser Absprachen hat
eine Auswirkung auf die Durchführungen des Prozesses, bevor der
entsprechende Patch nicht geschrieben und im
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Concurrent_Versions_System&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;DCVS&lt;/a&gt;

 eingecheckt worden ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aber Code ist nur ein Teil eines Prozesses - meistens die technische Seite
der ganzen Geschichte. Prozesse haben in Wirklichkeit immer mindestens drei
Aspekte - neben der Technik- noch die Organisations- und die Personalseite
der Angelegenheit. Außerdem kommt zu jedem Definitionsteil (den Regeln) auch
noch ein Kontrollteil (die Einhaltung der Regeln messen) dazu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/verkehr.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Straßenverkehr&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein bekannter und von jedem verstandener Prozeß ist zum Beispiel der
öffentliche Straßenverkehr. Dieser hat eine organisatorische Seite -
Verkehrsregeln, Definition von Verkehrszeichen und so weiter, eine
personelle Seite - Ausbildung der Verkehrsteilnehmer in der Schule, der
Fahrschule und so weiter, und eine technische Seite - Fahrzeugsysteme,
stationäre Verkehrssysteme wie Ampeln, und so weiter. Für jeden Bereich gibt
es Kontrollteile - die Verkehrspolizei überwacht die Einhaltung des
organisatorischen Teils, die Fahrprüfung ist eine Kontrolle der Ausbildung,
und der TÜV ist eine Kontrolle der Technik.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ebenso finden wir diese Teile in kleiner bei unserem
Server-Installationsprozeß wieder. Wir finden einen organisatorischen Teil,
also eine Diskussion darüber, was wir mit dem Installserver für ein Problem
lösen wollen und welche nicht (Abgrenzung und Scope: &amp;ldquo;Nach der Installation
des Basissystem wird dieses durch Puppet personalisiert, der Installserver
soll nur eine allgemeine Basisinstallation durchführen&amp;rdquo;). Wir finden einen
Personalteil, meistens in Form von Wikipages mit Dokumentation realisiert,
und dazu Fortbildungsveranstaltungen für neue Mitarbeiter (&amp;ldquo;Unser
Installserver und wie man ihn benutzt und anpaßt&amp;rdquo;). Und wir finden den
technischen Teil, also den Server selber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Kontrollinstanzen sind bei vielen Prozessen weniger stark ausgeprägt als
bei einem großen und unter Umständen gefährlichen System wie dem
Straßenverkehr, existieren aber je nach Wichtigkeit des Prozesses durchaus -
zum Beispiel wird von einem neuen Sysadmin nach dem Kurs verlangt, eine
triviale Änderung am Installserver durchzuführen und dann eine Kiste mit dem
Teil selbstständig, aber unter Aufsicht zu installieren. Und natürlich guckt
man, ob der Installserver noch geht und ob die gelieferten Ergebnisse noch
den Anforderungen entsprechen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merlin, also der MySQL Enterprise &lt;strong&gt;Manager&lt;/strong&gt; ist nun ein gutes Beispiel für
das Versagen bei der Umsetzung eines solchen Konzeptes. Also, MEM ist ein
gutes und nützliches Monitoring-Werkzeug und wir könnten eine Installation
unserer Größe ohne die Hilfe von Merlin nicht fahren. Aber im Lichte der
voranstehenden Diskussion kann man erkennen, wie Merlin zu kurz greift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das beginnt schon damit, daß Merlin überhaupt genau gar nichts &lt;em&gt;managed&lt;/em&gt;. Es
ist ein reines Monitoringwerkzeug, das zwar Graphen liefert, Queries findet
oder Alarme generiert, aber es &lt;em&gt;automatisiert&lt;/em&gt; nichts, genau genommen
verändert es nichts an einem laufenden System. Es ist ein &lt;strong&gt;Monitor&lt;/strong&gt;, aber
kein &lt;strong&gt;Manager&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wollte man die Prozesse in einem großen MySQL Deployment automatisieren,
dann müßte man sich erst einmal einen Katalog von Tätigkeiten machen, die in
Operations und in Development bei einer Datenbank so anfallen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Operations DBA plant ein Deployment, installiert Datenbanken, prüft und
verändert Konfigurationen (Configuration Management), muß deswegen Server
starten und stoppen, plant und führt Upgrades durch (Change Management),
überwacht den Betrieb (Monitoring), managed lokale Betriebsstörungen
(Incidents), findet gemeinsame Ursachen (Problem Management) und
kommuniziert mit dem Upstream (Support des Herstellers), und prüft ob die
Systemleistung in Zukunft noch ausreicht (Capacity Management). Er
kontrolliert Datensicherung und Restore (Backup, Desaster Recovery).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Development DBA ist Teil des Entwicklungsprozesses (sitzt im Scrum
Planning und so weiter mit dabei), hilft und berät beim Schemadesign und der
Datenmodellierung, beim Query Review, findet im Betrieb schlechte Queries,
hilft und berät bei der Optimierung, und plant zusammen mit dem Operations
DBA Schemaänderungen und Konfigurationsänderungen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dann würde man sich überlegen und durch Umfrage beim Kunden feststellen, wie
diese Profile in verschiedenen Systemgrößen den ausgestaltet sein werden -
denn wer 10^0 oder 10^1 Server insgesamt am Laufen hat, der wird kaum
zwischen Operations und Development DBA unterscheiden und nicht alle diese
Teilprozesse werden als eigenständige Gebiete identifizierbar sein. Kommt
man dann auf Installationen von 10^2, 10^3 oder 10^4 Servern, sieht das
alles plötzlich ganz anders aus und trifft auf ganz andere Bedürfnisse in
der Ausgestaltung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denn obwohl formell die gleichen Leistungen für den Betrieb erbracht werden
müssen, ist durch die schiere Größe der Installation mit einem Mal ein ganz
anderer Problemkomplex im Gesamtbild wichtig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zum Beispiel: Um 500 Server in 2 Dutzend Replikationshierarchien an 2
Standorten von MYSQL 5.1 nach 5.5 zu aktualisieren, ist ein Haufen Tests und
dann Upgrades notwendig. Aber selbst wenn man es schafft, 5 Server pro Tag
abzuarbeiten (jeder je nach Größe mit 100G bis 10.000G an Daten), dann
braucht man 100 Arbeitstage, also etwas weniger als ein halbes Jahr, um das
Upgrade auszurollen, falls es nicht zu Komplikationen kommt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wünschenswert wäre es aber, das Thema binnen eines Monats (also 20
Arbeitstagen) vom Tisch zu haben - dazu muß man aber Techniken entwickeln,
mit denen man 50 Server oder mehr pro Tag geregelt bekommt. Das ist in
einigen Bereichen der Installation schon von der Plattenleistung und der
Netzwerkkapazität her problematisch, also redet hier der Operations DBA
plötzlich mit Sysadmin, Storage und Network Engineering, die
Vorraussetzungen schaffen müssen, um solche Dinge im regulären Betrieb
abwickeln zu können - denn das nächste Release kommt binnen eines Jahres mit
Sicherheit und Upgrades dürfen keine Ausnahmesituation sein, sondern müssen
als Bestandteil des normalen Systembetriebes durchgeführt werden können.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Und schon werden die Bereiche Organisation und Personal bei nur 10^3 Servern
im Laden dicke fette Punkte auf dem Managementradar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zurück zu Merlin: Der MEM taucht in diesem Problembild gar nicht auf - kaum
als Hilfe bei der Planung eines solchen Unterfangens und gar nicht als
Hilfsmittel bei der Umsetzung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hätte man Merlin richtig aufgezogen, dann hätte MySQL als Hersteller der
Datenbank sich mit Kunden und Community zusammengesetzt, und eben einen
solchen Katalog von betrieblichen Tätigkeiten des Operations- und des
Development DBA aufgestellt und die Bilder einmal ausgemalt und für die
verschiedenen Betriebsgrößen skaliert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danach hätte man zusammen mit Kunden und Community das MySQL Systemhandbuch
erstellt, also einmal mustergültig die Best Practice beim Betrieb von MySQL
dokumentiert und ausgeführt, wie man diese Best Practices für 1, 10, 100,
1000 Server umsetzt - was ist wichtig, was ist unwichtig, wenn man klein
oder wenn man groß ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schließlich hätte man mit seiner Consulting und mit seiner Training- und
Certification-Abteilung, also MySQL Services als Ganzes, dieses Konzept
umgesetzt und in Consulting, Training und Certficiation einfließen lassen,
und dann eine Architektur und Werkzeuge in dieser Architektur erstellt, die
diese Prozesse technisch unterstützen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All das ist komplett nicht passiert (aus Gründen, die jetzt nicht mehr
zutreffen, und weil Merlin Ziele hatte, die nicht den oben genannten
Anforderungen entsprechen und die jetzt so auch nicht mehr gelten, aber das
ist alles wie gesagt eine andere Geschichte an einem anderen Lagerfeuer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hätte man das umgesetzt, könnte ich jetzt vermutlich in Merlin die Liste der
von Oracle releasten MySQL-Versionen auf deren Server sehen, mit grünen
Haken hinter den Pakete, deren digitale Signatur validiert. Ich würde dann
Versionen Servergruppen zuweisen und den Prozeß &amp;ldquo;Rollout&amp;rdquo; anstoßen. Merlin
würde das RPM dann in meine lokalen yum Repositories runterladen und das
Puppet-Rezept dieser Gruppen so anpassen, daß die entsprechenden Server
aktualisiert oder neu aufgesetzt werden - aber so gestaggered, daß der
Betrieb davon nicht beeinflußt wird und natürlich auf eine Weise
koordiniert, die Server vor dem Upgrade aus dem Loadbalancer nimmt, und die
die Funktionalität und den Erfolg des Upgrades testet und die Caches
vorglüht, bevor die Kiste in den LB zurück geht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man sieht auch in dieser Erklärung schon ein paar weitere wichtige Aspekte
der ganzen Sache: Es ist wichtig, den Scope abzugrenzen und nicht die
Aufgaben anderer Werkzeuge zu übernehmen, sondern diese korrekt zu
integrieren. Weder gilt es das Paketformat und das Paketsystem des
Trägersystems durch was eigenes (einen Bitrock-Installer?) zu ersetzen, noch
die Funktionalität anderer Automatisierungs-Techniken zu duplizieren.
Stattdessen sollte Best Practice Empfehlungen aussprechen und
Kompatibilitäten definieren (&amp;ldquo;Wir unterstützen Puppet und Chef für Systems
Automation, liefern receipts dafür und integrieren deren Schnittstellen in
unseren Tools&amp;rdquo;). Und sie sollte sich bewußt sein, daß Kisten nicht alleine
Laufen, sondern Teil eines Systems sind (mit dem LB reden!) und Zustand
haben (Caches müssen warm sein!). Und Paranoia ist ein Admintugend
(Testen!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn man Automatisierung also nicht auf dem Anwenderlevel, sondern auf dem
Level eines Herstellers betrachtet, dann ist Automatisierung noch viel
weniger ein technisches Problem als auf dem Anwenderlevel - es ist vielmehr
in erster Linie tatsächlich ein organisatisches (Abgrenzung? Integration?
Kommunikation mit anderen Projekten?) und ein personelles Problem (Akzeptanz
der Best Practice? Werbung dafür? Schulung? Prüfung?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Und alles das muß man neben der Technik eben auch mit thematisieren, wenn
man Wachstum in einer Firma skalieren und kanalisieren will - man muß nicht
nur die Technik, sondern auch die Organisation und seine Leute mit
skalieren.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Schnitzeljagd 2010 - Die Rache der Cyborgs</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2010/12/15/schnitzeljagd-2010-die-rache-der-cyborgs.html</link>

      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2010/12/15/schnitzeljagd-2010-die-rache-der-cyborgs.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Heute war ich auf einer Schnitzeljagd, als Kennenlernspiel und
Teambuilding-Exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So die Theorie. 2010 läuft so etwas anders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geht zu dem und dem - betriebsbedingt - Hotel. Google Maps an. Ah, dort
ist es. Da gehen wir dann hin, walking navigation (experimental).
Funktioniert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hier ist Eure nächste Aufgabe. Firmenbedingt Fragen zum Hotelbusiness.
Wir sind IT, keine Hotel-Leute. Man kann uns die Antworten zu den Fragen in
einem Vortrag erklären, oder wir können &amp;ldquo;raten&amp;rdquo;: 5 Leute in der Gruppe, 5
Smartphones auf dem Tisch. Wettgooglen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hier ist Eure nächste Aufgabe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/kuehe1.jpg&#34;&gt;Bild&lt;/a&gt;

. 2 Laptops auf dem Tisch, die Leute zücken Perl.
Leider ist die Aufgabe unterspezifiziert, und je nach Interpretation der
Grenzbedingungen kommen unterschiedliche Lösungen raus. Leider blockiert der
Safe nach 3 Fehlversuchen für 15 Minuten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nach mehr als einer Stunde geben
wir das Programmieren auf und wenden uns Google zu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ergebnis: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.authorstream.com/Presentation/Goldye-37632-RabbitsCowsDaVinci-first-year-original-cow-calf-second-2-calves-third-3-fourth-oldest-bec-as-Entertainment-ppt-powerpoint/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Lösung und Quellenangabe&lt;/a&gt;

.
Ist recht. Nächstes Mal denken wir gar nicht und suchen nur noch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Im Safe Fotos von Gebäuden, betriebsbedingt Hotels nahe Wahrzeichen.
Frage: Welche Städte? Antwort: Google Goggles. Ich sagte ja schon, daß wir
Smartphones haben.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ergebnis 1: Das Konzept Schnitzeljagd degeneriert in der Nähe von permanent
verfügbarem Online zu &amp;lsquo;Teste Dein Google-Fu&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ergebnis 2: Serialisierung der Schnitzeljagd (Frage n-1 muß gelöst werden,
damit man die Frage n erhält) war schon vor dem Internet ein doofes und
langweiliges Konzept. Mit 15 Minuten Lockout da drin generiert es bloß
sinnlosen Frust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Können wir bitte nächstes Jahr was sinnvolles machen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2008/08/29/cyborg.html&#34;&gt;Cyborg&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>Kulturelles Defizit</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2010/02/28/kulturelles-defizit.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Feb 2010 08:37:53 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2010/02/28/kulturelles-defizit.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Seitdem ich für Geld andere Leute glücklich mache bin ich immer wieder
einige Jahre auf der Walz gewesen, und habe mich als Angehöriger des
fahrendes Volkes als Projektkraft bei wechselden Auftraggebern verdingt, um
danach wieder einige Jahre fest in einem Laden angestellt ein wenig
seßhafter zu werden, Kraft zu tanken und das Gelernte zu verarbeiten. Eine
der Sachen, die ich mich dabei immer wieder fasziniert haben sind die
unterschiedlichen Arbeitsstile der verschiedenen europäischen Kulturen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vielleicht ist meine Sample-Größe zu klein, vielleicht ist meine Auswahl von
anderen Faktoren beeinflußt, aber ich bin zu der festen Überzeugung gelangt,
daß zum Beispiel britische Firmenkulturen durch einen gemeinsamen Feind,
eine gemeinsame Zumutung zusammengehalten werden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In jeder britischen Firma, in der ich jemals gewesen bin, gab es einen
Umstand, der vollkommen unerträglich war und den jeder, der dort gearbeitet
hat, auf das Blut gehaßt hat. In einer Firma zum Beispiel war es ein
Ansagensystem, das den Leuten circa einmal pro Stunde durch eine für den
weitaus größten Teil der Mitarbeiter nutzlose Ansagen jeden sinnvollen
Gedanken aus dem Hirn geblasen hat, Meetings unterbrochen und Redeflüsse
gestört.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In einer anderen Firma befand man sich in einem Gebäude, das seit mindestens
2 Jahren im Zustand der Renovierung und des Umbaues befindlich war,
Stockwerk für Stockwerk. In einer dritten Firma befand man sich in einem
viktorianischen Stadthaus in einem der feinsten Viertel von London, aber
mußte in den Tiefpaterre-Räumen des Dienstbotentraktes zusammengepfercht
arbeiten - und vierteltypisch einige Meilen weit gehen oder fahren, um ein
Mittagessen oder auch nur eine Flasche Kakao in einem Cornershop kaufen zu
können.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aber niemand hat jemals einen Versuch unternommen, diese Sache zu verbessern
oder gar abzustellen. Stattdessen wurde geredet, sich beklagt und
gegenseitig bemitleidet. Abhilfe wäre kontraproduktiv gewesen, denn dann
hätte man der Gruppe die gemeinsame Identifikation weggenommen, die sie
zusammengeschweißt hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beeindruckt haben mich viele skandinavische Firmen. Auf irgendeine Weise hat
man dort einen Weg gefunden, mehr zu schaffen als in vielen anderen Firmen,
die ich gesehen habe, und gleichzeitig die Arbeit so zu organisieren, daß
niemand davon genervt ist. Zusammenhalt wird dort auf eine andere,
wesentlich schmerzfreiere Weise generiert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das fängt schon auf eine subtile Weise am Morgen an:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In vielen dieser Firmen stellt der Arbeitgeber ein Frühstücksbuffet. Da es
kostenlos ist, essen die meisten Leute nicht daheim, sondern bringen die
Kinder in die Schule oder den firmeneigenen Kindergarten und gehen dann in
die Kantine zum Essen. Am Buffet säbelt man sich einige Scheiben Brot
herunter, greift sich Butter, einen Klecks Marmelade oder eine Scheibe Wurst
und einen Pott Kaffee und setzt sich dann gemeinsam mit den Kollegen auf
eine Bank. Man erzählt sich von gestern abend, von den Kindern oder dem
Theaterbesuch, oder daß man Segeln gewesen ist. Langsam, aber fast von
selbst driftet das Gespräch zum heutigen Tag und was passieren wird - wer
was ausprobieren wird, was fehlt, und was von einem selbst erwartet wird,
damit die anderen Mitglieder des Teams weiter arbeiten können.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Übergang ist subtil, aber automatisch und er findet jeden Morgen statt.
Nach dem Frühstück sind irgendwie alle gebriefed und haben im Kopf eine
Liste von Dingen, die an diesem Vormittag weggehauen werden müssen, damit es
voran geht. Natürlich trifft man sich zum Mittagessen wieder, und tauscht
dort Ergebnisse aus, verabredet sich zu Besprechungen oder Präsentationen
und plant so gemeinsam beim Essen den Nachmittag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aber auch das Arbeiten in Gruppen ist dort anders, auf eine sehr angenehme
Weise. Ein Freund von mir aus Deutschland, Olaf Schlüter, hat vor vielen
Jahren einmal den Spruch geprägt: &amp;ldquo;Team ist, wenn von sechs Leuten zwei
Arbeiten. Wenn das immer andere Zwei sind, dann funktioniert das Team.&amp;rdquo; Das
ist, auf eine Weise, präzise die Beschreibung dieser Arbeitsweise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typischerweise haben wir dort zu sechs Personen, plus/minus ein paar,
zusammengesessen. Zwei haben rumgekaspert - würde man es formalisieren,
würde man es als Brainstorming bezeichnen. Zwei andere haben Dinge
vorbereitet - würde man es formalisieren, wäre es Pair Programming oder eine
Verallgemeinerung davon. Und zwei weitere haben etwas vorgeführt, umgesetzt
oder sonstwie etwas getan, das ein klassischer Beobachter &amp;ldquo;arbeiten&amp;rdquo; nennen
würde. Nach einer Weile durchmischt sich das, alle tauschen die Plätze,
reden miteinander und die Gruppe konfiguriert sich um, und dann geht es in
neuer Zusammenstellung weiter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dabei kommt es zu einem Effekt, den ich in Deutschland nahezu niemals
beobachten kann - außerhalb gewisser Geek- und Hackerzirkel jedenfalls. Und
das ist die Tatsache, daß man an Gesicht und Ansehen gewinnen kann, wenn man
in einer Diskussion seinen Fehler erkennt und sich dem Standpunkt seines
Gegenredners anschließt oder diesen übernimmt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist den meisten deutschen Firmenkulturen so entgegengesetzt, daß ich
überhaupt nicht mitbekommen habe was da passiert, als ich so einen
Positionswechsel das erste Mal beobachtet habe. Jemand, der Teamleiter gar,
obwohl das in diesen Gruppen kaum eine Rolle spielt, präsentierte seinen
Vorschlag an der Tafel und brachte dabei einige Abschätzungen hinsichtlich
Speicherplatz, Rechenaufwand und Kosten. Jemand anders aus der Gruppe
blickte von seinem Zettel auf, auf dem er einige Zahlen hingeschmiert hatte,
und meinte nur &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s all wrong.&amp;rdquo; Er stand auf, griff sich den Filzstift
und skizzierte seinen Plan gleich neben dem anderen. &amp;ldquo;If you do it like
this, and this, then you can do it in less than half the time, and with only
a fraction of the storage.&amp;rdquo; Der Chef stutzte kurz, dachte nach und entschloß
sich dann, seine eigene Idee zu verwerfen und die seines Mitarbeiters zu
übernehmen. &amp;ldquo;You are completely right. This is much better. We will be doing
it your way.&amp;rdquo; Anerkennendes Nicken in der ganzen Runde, und ein
Gesichtsgewinn für beide im ganzen Team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das alles führt zu einer Arbeitsweise, die ich als sehr entspannend
empfinde: Obwohl man echt viel Arbeit wegschafft, hat kaum jemand mal Streß.
Die meisten Fragen und Termine werden im Vorübergehen beim Frühstück oder
Mittagessen geklärt, und beim Arbeiten spielt man sich die Bälle zu. Die
Kultur ist so eingerichtet, daß Kooperation belohnt wird, und Ansehen
basiert nicht darauf, ob man sich durchsetzt, sondern ob man die Gruppe
voran bringt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist zugleich die Arbeitsweise und Einstellung, die der deutschen Politik
so vollkommen fehlt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es täte diesem Land echt gut, hätte man in der Koalition den
Expertenmeinungen von Techniker- und Juristenseite Gehör geschenkt, als es
um die Konstruktion des Zugangserschwerungsgesetzes ging, oder früher noch,
als es darum ging, die Stoßrichtung der Agenda auf diesem Gebiet überhaupt
festzulegen. Es hat eine klar artikulierte und durchstrukturierte Kritik an
der Idee des Zugangserschwerungsgesetzes selbst gegeben - Löschen statt
Sperren (und nicht etwa Löschen vor Sperren), Konstruktion internationaler
Zusammenarbeit (die noch dazu für andere Delikte nutzbringend einsetzbar
gewesen wäre) und Vermeidung eines sinn- und wirkungslosen
Grundrechtseingriffes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stattdessen hat man im Wahlkampfwahn den eigenen Irrweg zementiert. Man tat
das in dem Glauben, daß deutsche Kultur Durchsetzungskraft an sich mehr
belohnt als Korrektheit oder Brauchbarkeit der Lösung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gesichtsgewinn durch Übernehmen und Aufgreifen der besseren Idee, das ist
das große Defizit der akuellen politischen Kultur in unserem Land. Das ist
es wirklich: die Äußerungen in der Debatte im Petitionsausschuß und zum
Aufhebungsgesetz - ja, Frau Bär, auch und gerade sie sind gemeint! -
zeigen, daß man immer noch der Meinung ist, einen politisch Gewinn
bringenden Kurs zu verfolgen, oder vermeintlich Frau von der Leyen schützen
zu müssen, indem man an dem von ihr initiierten Irrwegen weiter festhält.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es ist zugleich die Hoffnung, die die Piraten in der deutschen Politik
darstellen. Denn einer der Kernpunkte des piratischen Denkens, der mir das
Herz aufgehen läßt, ist die Konzentration auf die Sachpolitik. Es ist die
Fähigkeit, das Bessere anerkennen zu können und ihm dadurch den Weg zu
bereiten, daß man sich selbst beiseite nimmt und hinter die bessere Idee
stellt. Selbst dann, wenn es nicht die eigene war.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Internet und Produktivität aus der Sicht eines Cyborgs</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2009/10/09/internet-und-produktivit-t-aus-der-sicht-eines-cyborgs.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Oct 2009 12:23:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2009/10/09/internet-und-produktivit-t-aus-der-sicht-eines-cyborgs.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Auf dem wunderbaren Blog Netzwertig findet man
&lt;a href=&#34;http://netzwertig.com/2009/10/09/internet-und-produktivitaet-zeitverschwendung-vs-effizienzgewinn/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Zeitverschwendung vs. Effizienzgewinn&lt;/a&gt;

:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man kennt sie ja, die Klagen über verschwendete Zeit am Arbeitsplatz.
Anstelle produktiv zu sein und ihren Job zu erledigen, surfen Angestellte
bei Facebook, Twitter und YouTube – und fügen damit Firmen erheblichen
Schaden zu. So zumindest sehen es viele Unternehmen und blockieren daher
den Zugriff auf einschlägige Sites des Social Web. 54 Prozent der
US-Unternehmen sperren Social Networks komplett, so eine aktuelle Studie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Weigert versucht zu erklären, warum solche Aktivitäten nicht schlimm
sind, scheitert aber, weil er zu kurz greift:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doch lediglich zu kritisieren, Facebook &amp;amp; Co würden die Produktivität
vermindern, ist nur die halbe Wahrheit. Die Tatsache des Effizienzgewinns
durch die Digitalisierung sollte man keinesfalls vernachlässigen. Hier
lässt sich erheblich mehr gewinnen, als auf der anderen Seite Zeit zu
verlieren ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es gibt noch einen anderen Aspekt, der viel wichtiger und weitgehender ist
und den er nicht erwähnt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In meinem früheren Leben als Datenbank-Consultant bin ich viel als Fremder
in Firmennetzen gewesen und oft nicht richtig in deren IT-Infrastruktur
integriert gewesen: Jedes mal, wenn ich bei einem Kunden aufgeschlagen bin,
war einer der ersten Handgriffe, Vernetzung herzustellen und meinem Laptop
einen Weg &lt;em&gt;nach draussen&lt;/em&gt; ins Internet zu bahnen - und das nicht nur für das
Web, sondern auch für alle anderen Dienste. Erst in zweiter Linie habe ich
dann das Problem gelöst, im Netz des Kunden auf deren Datenbankserver
zugreifen zu können.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bei einigen Kunden war das nicht so leicht möglich, weil deren Firewalls die
Mitarbeiter und mich so weit isoliert haben, daß ich keinen Zugriff auf die
Außenwelt bekommen konnte. Solche Aufträge waren immer besonders schwierig
und für den Kunden nicht sehr produktiv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warum war es mir so wichtig, &lt;em&gt;raus&lt;/em&gt; zu kommen, wo ich doch für die
Kundendatenbanken gekommen bin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn ein Kunde mich als Consultant mietet oder mich als Mitarbeiter
einstellt, dann bekommt er nicht bloß mich, sondern er bekommt auch einen
sehr großen Teil von Infrastruktur, der nicht sichtbar ist - ich bin ein
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2008/08/29/cyborg.html&#34;&gt;Cyborg&lt;/a&gt;

 und neben einer
biologischen Komponente bestehe ich auch noch aus einer technischen und vor
allen Dingen auch aus einer sozialen Komponente, einem Netzwerk von
Verbindungen, Bekanntschaften und Freundschaften, die es mir ermöglichen,
weitaus mehr zu leisten als ich es als eine rein auf das biologische
reduzierte Person jemals könnte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durch
&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/RolandTichy/status/4550060774&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;meine Art zu Leben&lt;/a&gt;

:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ich reiste beruflich fast drei Jahre durch Europa und die USA, aber ich
war immer zu Hause - Eastern Standard Tribe oder in meinem Fall der Stamm
der MESZler war immer für mich erreichbar, wo immer ich war: Ich habe
nicht mehr oder weniger Kontakt mit meinen Freunden gehabt bloß weil ich
mal ein paar Wochen auf einem anderen Kontinent war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mein Griff zum externen Netzwerk dient dazu, diesen Teil meines Ich wieder
anzuschließen und für mich wie auch für meinen jeweiligen Auftraggeber
wieder verfügbar zu machen: Dadurch bin ich in der Lage, Antworten auf
Fragen schneller zu finden, Ideen aus meinem Netz zu ziehen und für mich
nutzbar zu machen, Hinweise und Verweise aufzupicken und generell sehr viel
produktiver zu sein als ich es ohne Netz wäre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apophenia beschreibt in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2009/07/13/i_want_my_cybor.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;I want my Cyborg
life&lt;/a&gt;


wie das funktioniert, was ich (und jeder andere, der unter das &amp;lsquo;Lebensgefühl
der Piraten&amp;rsquo; fällt) da tue. Sie beschreibt einen Konflikt zwischen einem
Offliner und sich:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Italy two weeks ago, I attended Modernity 2.0 (in the lovely Urbino
hosted by the fantastic Fabio Giglietto). There were two audiences in
attendance - a young cohort of &amp;ldquo;internet scholars&amp;rdquo; and an older cohort
deeply invested in sociocybernetics. At one point, after a talk, one of
the sociocybernetics scholars (actually, the former President of the
sociocybernetics organization&amp;hellip; I know&amp;hellip; I looked him up) began his
question by highlight that, unlike most of the audience who seemed more
invested in the internet than scholarly conversations, HE had been paying
attention. He was sitting next to me. He looked at me as he said this.It&amp;rsquo;s
not very often that I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve been publicly bitchslapped but boy
did that sting. And then I felt pissy, like a resentful stubborn child
bent on proving him wrong. Somehow, as I grew my hair out and became an
adult, I also became less spiteful because boy was I determined to bite
back. Of course, I haven&amp;rsquo;t become that much of an adult because here I am
blogging the details of said encounter.There&amp;rsquo;s no doubt that I barely
understood what the speaker was talking about. But during the talk, I had
looked up six different concepts he had introduced (thank you Wikipedia),
scanned two of the speakers&amp;rsquo; papers to try to grok what on earth he was
talking about, and used Babelfish to translate the Italian conversations
taking place on Twitter and FriendFeed in attempt to understand what was
being said. Of course, I had also looked up half the people in the room
(including the condescending man next to me) and posted a tweet of my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die ständige Verfügbarkeit von Netz und Connectivity verändert das Arbeiten
und den Umgang miteinander radikal. Nicht nur ist es für viele meiner
Freunde weitgehend egal, in welcher Stadt oder auf welchem Kontinent ich die
letzten paar Jahre gelebt habe, sondern das Netz erlaubt mir auch,
Informationen &amp;lsquo;in Echtzeit&amp;rsquo; aufzusammeln und mein Wissen im Vorübergehen
anzupassen und zu komplettieren. Darum sehe ich mit einem Laptop auf dem
Schoß fern - immer ein Wikipedia- und IMDB-Fenster offen - und darum brauche
ich auch Netz nach draußen, wenn ich irgendwo arbeite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Als MySQL Consultant hat mir das Zugriff auf das Handbuch, den Support
IRC-Server und meine Kollegen bei anderen Kunden gegeben, bei meiner
jetzigen Arbeit gibt es mir Zugriff auf meine ehemaligen Kollegen aus einer
Reihe von vergangenen Jobs, auf Ex-Kunden, die inzwischen anderswo arbeiten
und gute Bekannte geblieben sind, und auf viele Nachschlagequellen, an die
ich mich erinnere, aber die ich neu suchen muß, wenn ich wirklich damit
arbeiten wollte. Plus eine Riesenwelle an News, RSS, Tweets und Mail sowie
drei bis vier verschiedene Chatsysteme, die mich nahe bei den Leuten hält,
die mir wichtig sind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein Arbeitgeber, der so etwas abtrennte, bekäme eine kleinere Person und
einen weitaus schwächeren Mitarbeiter - für die Zeit die ich überbrücken
müßte, bis ich eine richtige Stelle gefunden hätte. Denn so werde ich
dauerhaft nie arbeiten wollen.&lt;/p&gt;
