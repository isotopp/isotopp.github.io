      <title>SQL Engineering Guidelines</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/04/15/sql-engineering-guidelines.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Where I work, the native database is MySQL.
This is what the database team fully supports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other databases, notably Postgres, are in use mostly because external products we run require them.
Internal projects should use MySQL.
An external company provides limited support for running Postgres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recommended version of MySQL to be used is currently the latest 8.0.
It has a large number of improvements over the previous version 5.7 in terms of the SQL subset supported, handling of sorts, critical character set support and join strategies.
Versions of MySQL older than 5.7 are completely unsupported and contain unfixed critical CVEs.
They must never be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that &amp;lsquo;fully supports&amp;rsquo; does also include operational aspects of the database:
Automated handling of grants, automated fail-over, replication tree management, capacity planning, restore testing of automated backups, and integration with compliance tickets.
Using other SQL products is likely to leave a team with a lot of toil that is taken away by automation had you been choosing MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34;&gt;
	Overview
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are using a &amp;lsquo;safe subset&amp;rsquo; of MySQL (&amp;ldquo;Blue MySQL&amp;rdquo;) and not all features of the product.
That said, we are an enterprise with several hundred use-cases.
For each of these rules a counterexample project likely exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;lsquo;safe subset&amp;rsquo; of MySQL mostly means: We do not store code in the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We do not use views.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We do not use stored procedures or stored functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We do not use triggers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We do not use UDFs (&amp;ldquo;user defined functions&amp;rdquo;, &lt;code&gt;.so&lt;/code&gt; files that are loaded into the server proper and can be called as SQL-functions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not run code in the database, because it makes applications very hard to update atomically in a rollout.
It also makes it hard to see all code that is part of the application in a developers&amp;rsquo; editor, because some of it is in git, and other code is part of the schema.
Finally, code in the database creates some kind of spooky action at a distance that creates lots of debugging problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically for MySQL, the MySQL stored procedure language is as beautiful as COBOL, as efficient as PHP 3, and as debuggable as embedded Lua.
Do not use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;general&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#general&#34;&gt;
	General
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQL systems are stateful systems, so your application can be stateless.
That means there is state in a lot of unexpected places in SQL, and you have to be aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/07/28/mysql-connection-scoped-state.html&#34;&gt;Connection Scoped State&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COMMIT can fail, and you must be able to retry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Databases store data for a long time.
Often longer than the code that created the data lives.
For example, there are databases in production that have an uninterrupted change history of more than 20 years.
The data started out in Postgres, was converted and migrated to MySQL 4.0 and then lived through a change of versions up to MySQL 8.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Database administrators operate with this in mind, and use a lot of defensive operational procedures.
Get their input and their help when planning changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All data has a full data lifecycle: It is being created, ingested, stored, changed and updated and ultimately exported to different systems and/or deleted.
Plan the full data lifecycle, and pay special attention to tables that have time as a component of the primary key or the table name, or otherwise exhibit log nature.
Every transactional database has a data warehouse inside, and it struggles to get out. Given the same number of customers, articles and transactions each day, will your database grow without bounds and which structures cause that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Database administrators will help you to complete the data lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;absolute-limits&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#absolute-limits&#34;&gt;
	Absolute Limits
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MySQL has a number of limits that are part of the codebase.&lt;/strong&gt;
Specifically, &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-limits.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;InnoDB limits&lt;/a&gt;

 are documented in the manual.
It is useful to be familiar with at least the information on indexing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that there are other limits that will affect you, based on physics, operations and available hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;size&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#size&#34;&gt;
	Size
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you running out of disk space? Know what to monitor, and how to handle the situation and &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/02/16/databases-how-large-is-too-large.html&#34;&gt;absolute size limits&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deleting data costs disk space.&lt;/strong&gt;
MySQL is running in a replication hierarchy, and in order to replicate MySQL stores a pre- and post-change image of each changed row in the binlog.
This is kept for up to seven days to allow lagging replicas to catch up.
For deletion, the pre-deletion image of the row is sent to the binlog, in order to allow the replica to find the row to delete it. This consumes disk space, which will be reclaimed only after seven days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A DBA can help you here to reclaim space early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size is Time, and Time is Size.&lt;/strong&gt;
Assuming 400 MB/s copy speed, copying one terabyte of data takes around 45 minutes.
Adding 15 minutes of replication catchup, you can expect around 1 hour of creation time per terabyte of database size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Databases of around 200-250 GB size have a creation time of around 10-15 minutes per instance.
That is sufficient even for databases in Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The DBA Standard SLO supports databases are &amp;lt;2 TB in size&lt;/strong&gt;, and fit onto a 1.92 TB sized standard NVME drive, including binlog and overhead.
They take around 2h to create from a donor instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Databases larger than that require special storage (external persistent volumes), which will have worse latency and cost more.
It will not be available immediately, and moving existing databases (which are already large) to different storage will take time in accordance with their size. Plan ahead, and plan with a DBA to make this a smooth transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The instance size limit is approximately 10 TB.&lt;/strong&gt; Instances larger than 10 TB will have a creation time so large that operations will have at most one attempt per day to do anything with the instances.
This produces unsustainable toil for DBA, and drag on your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, some time &lt;strong&gt;before hitting the 10 TB barrier your project will have to have an exit plan in place&lt;/strong&gt; to avoid hitting this limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan can be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use Cassandra or another sharded NoSQL storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use shards in MySQL, doing application level sharding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;consider a supported distributed database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will involve in all cases moving to a distributed setup that more or less transparently shards.
It will also involve moving to a setup where &lt;code&gt;JOIN&lt;/code&gt; will be much more costly because of the distributed nature of the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do currently have larger databases than 10 TB.
Contact their owners to understand the nature of their toil problems and why your setup wants to avoid this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;latency&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#latency&#34;&gt;
	Latency
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write your SQL and your applications SQL execution model with milliseconds of query execution time in mind, even for reads.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, we have on-prem databases with a memory saturated setup, and they expose query latencies for single primary key lookups in memory of 0.15ms.
This will not hold in the cloud, in virtual environments, and also not in setups that put ProxySQL in-between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Count the number of queries run to render a page using the available Event Instrumentation.&lt;/strong&gt;
Will the page render properly with 1-4 milliseconds of query execution time for each query?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep read-replicas of your data close to the application.&lt;/strong&gt; Crossing the boundaries between AZs will add another 4-10ms, or more, to each query. If your application is running on-premises, but your database is in the cloud, this is likely much slower than setting up local replicas and extending the replication hierarchy into the local AZ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using certain database ORMs, it can be easy to accidentally create SQL being executed in a loop.
For each object accessed in a loop, the ORM secretly fires a single primary key lookup in the background to fleshen the object lazily when it is accessed for the first time.
This is called machine-gunning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid machine-gunning&lt;/strong&gt;, primary key lookups in a loop. Consider using a &lt;code&gt;SELECT ... FROM table WHERE id IN ( ... around 1000 constants ... )&lt;/code&gt; clause.
If this is driven by another select, consider using a &lt;code&gt;JOIN&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;statement-size&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#statement-size&#34;&gt;
	Statement size
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objects and statements are limited to &lt;code&gt;max_allowed_packet&lt;/code&gt;, currently 16 MB in size.
Additionally, certain &lt;code&gt;WHERE id IN (...)&lt;/code&gt; clauses begin to show degraded performance and excessive memory use for a large number of ids in MySQL 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim for around 1000 values in such clauses.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay below 16 MB statement size.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For bulk writes, keep the transaction size to a reasonable 1000 to 10000 rows per commit.&lt;/strong&gt;
Group replication will be unhappy if you don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;many-tables-join&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#many-tables-join&#34;&gt;
	Many-tables &lt;code&gt;JOIN&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid &lt;code&gt;JOIN&lt;/code&gt;-ing more than 10 tables at once.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the optimizer were to brute-force all possible &lt;code&gt;JOIN&lt;/code&gt; combinations on an &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;-way table &lt;code&gt;JOIN&lt;/code&gt;, the number of combinations would be &lt;code&gt;n!&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;factorial&lt;/a&gt;

 of n).
This becomes an unwieldy number at a value of &lt;code&gt;n=10&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The optimizer will have to apply heuristics around a join-plan depth of 10, and do weird things, including sometimes missing obvious optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is usually not a problem, but if you are using an ORM and have deep class hierarchies, you may be hitting this limit inadvertently.
Be aware of your class-subclass relationships and how they are modelled, and what SQL is being generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bulk-updates-large-deletes-inserts-updates&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#bulk-updates-large-deletes-inserts-updates&#34;&gt;
	Bulk updates (large deletes, inserts, updates)
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very large atomic transactions are being executed on the primary, and on commit, enter the binlog. They then go downstream and execute on the replicas of that level, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As each replica has the same data as the primary, they will all approximately complete the statement at the same time. Your busy query will hog all replicas at the same tier at approximately the same time. You will likely lose capacity at each tier of the replication tree at once when executing such a large transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A query such as &lt;code&gt;DELETE FROM sales WHERE article_id &amp;lt; 1000000&lt;/code&gt; has the potential to make changes to very many rows. The update can take noticeable time, or depending on the data, even run for minutes or hours. The change can stall replicas, induce replication delay or otherwise impact production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all our supported languages packages, we have replication aware bulk update functions to handle this:
They will break up such large changes into manageable chunks, and execute them while monitoring replication lag.
Be sure to make good use of them, they exist for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-types-and-column-definitions&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#data-types-and-column-definitions&#34;&gt;
	Data types and column definitions
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MySQL supports a wide range of data types.
They are documented &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/data-types.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;in the manual&lt;/a&gt;

.
Each data type comes with a range and a storage size.
It is useful to know properties of the most common types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When choosing data types, think big (&amp;ldquo;assume 10x growth&amp;rdquo;).
Data types can be changed ex-post, but require an &lt;code&gt;ALTER TABLE&lt;/code&gt; command or an online schema change to be run.
This usually involves a background copy of all data of that table, and can take a lot of time for large tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional information about commonly needed data types can be found in your projects coding guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following rules have been proven to be useful guidance in the past:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;names&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#names&#34;&gt;
	Names
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Names are snake_case.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not use uppercase table names or column names.
We have done that in the past, and there are tables with upper case characters in names.
Don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depending on the version of MySQL and the filesystem in use, table names are case-sensitive or not, because they end up being file names on a case-sensitive file system or not.
Specifically, in production, on Linux, for older versions of MySQL table names are case-sensitive, so &lt;code&gt;Sales&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sales&lt;/code&gt; are different tables.
On Mac and Windows, with case-insensitive filesystems, they will be the same table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be consistent with column names.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not use MySQL keywords or reserved words as column names.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/keywords.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MySQL 8 list of reserved words&lt;/a&gt;

 lists keywords, reserved words, new keywords and reserved words - none of them should be used, even if some of them technically can be used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you must, quoting table and column names (&lt;code&gt;`table_name`&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;code&gt;`column_name`&lt;/code&gt;) avoids reserved word problems completely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Theoretically, using backticks it is possible to have column names and table names that contain spaces, or even emoji.
Don&amp;rsquo;t even think about that, much less try it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;normalization&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#normalization&#34;&gt;
	Normalization
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand database normal forms and aim for a relaxed third normal form.&lt;/strong&gt;
Try to &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2005/09/11/nermalisation.html&#34;&gt;normalize&lt;/a&gt;

 properly until you run into weirdness.
Only denormalize when you actually experience performance problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;keys&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#keys&#34;&gt;
	Keys
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every table must have a primary key.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In MySQL the primary key also defines the physical order of the data on disk:
Rows with similar primary key values will usually be stored physically closer together than rows with more dissimilar primary key values.
MySQL contains a large number of optimizations to exploit this and make this fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not having a primary key breaks group replication and row based replication.
We are using these features, so primary keys are mandatory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primary keys are short:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;integer&lt;/code&gt; (4 byte), &lt;code&gt;bigint&lt;/code&gt; (8 byte), &lt;code&gt;VARBINARY(16)&lt;/code&gt; (the output of &lt;code&gt;UUID_TO_BIN()&lt;/code&gt;, 16 byte).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MySQL uses primary keys as row addresses in all secondary keys. The longer the primary key, the more expensive the secondary key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That means &lt;code&gt;INDEX(a)&lt;/code&gt; will actually store &lt;code&gt;INDEX(a,id)&lt;/code&gt; (with &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; being the primary key) as a secondary index, and the optimizer knows that, and can use this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primary keys determine physical data ordering.&lt;/strong&gt;
Using the default InnoDB storage engine, the data itself is organized in a B+-tree in the primary key.
That is, the primary key holds the actual data rows in the leaf-nodes of the primary key.
That implies the data is physically arranged in primary key order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is why mutating a primary key is so expensive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This can be exploited to keep hot rows close together and reduce the working set size of the database.
InnoDB prefers hot rows to be close together, and has special-case code to make this work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This resonates nicely with &lt;code&gt;auto_increment&lt;/code&gt;: Using this, more recently inserted rows will be more on the &amp;ldquo;right-hand side&amp;rdquo; of the table, and older rows will be more on the &amp;ldquo;left-hand&amp;rdquo; side. Often data hotness coincides with row age, so using &lt;code&gt;auto_increment&lt;/code&gt; the database will automatically exploit this for smaller memory footprint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primary keys are immutable.&lt;/strong&gt;
Changing a primary key physically moves the record around in the data tree that makes up a table.
This is an extremely expensive operation.
Never change a primary key value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primary key values are not re-usable.&lt;/strong&gt;
When deleting a record, the primary key that once identified that record can never be re-used.
It may be still referenced by things outside the database, such as URLs with the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; as a parameter.
Re-using the primary would potentially link an external thing to a completely unrelated &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To use a UUID as a primary key, define the column as &lt;code&gt;VARBINARY(16)&lt;/code&gt; and use the &lt;code&gt;UUID_TO_BIN()&lt;/code&gt; function with swap flag set to true.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/miscellaneous-functions.html#function_uuid-to-bin&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;UUID_TO_BIN(string_uuid, 1)&lt;/a&gt;

: &amp;ldquo;If swap_flag is 1, the format of the return value differs: The time-low and time-high parts (the first and third groups of hexadecimal digits, respectively) are swapped. This moves the more rapidly varying part to the right and can improve indexing efficiency if the result is stored in an indexed column.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From MySQL&amp;rsquo;s point of view, &lt;code&gt;AUTO_INCREMENT&lt;/code&gt; integer primary keys work better than UUID, but a lot of software prefers UUID.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UUIDs can have advantages for high insert rates, because they can be created independently in different clients in parallel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MySQL stores data physically in primary key order, but the way UUIDs order is not advantageous to that.
MySQL provides the &lt;code&gt;UUID_TO_BIN(string_uuid, 1)&lt;/code&gt; function to fix this.
Consider using it, it unlocks many performance advantages. &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/04/06/mysql-and-uuids.html&#34;&gt;UUID discussion&lt;/a&gt;

, &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/09/22/alter-table-for-uuid.html&#34;&gt;Another UUID discussion&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The datatype produced by &lt;code&gt;UUID_TO_BIN()&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;VARBINARY(16)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When using &lt;code&gt;integer&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;bigint&lt;/code&gt; primary keys, consider making it &lt;code&gt;unsigned&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will double the key range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your primary programming language cannot handle &lt;code&gt;unsigned&lt;/code&gt; values, it is okay to use &lt;code&gt;signed&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember that Javascript has a 53-bit problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In your table definition, keep the primary key to the left.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is purely cosmetic, but it will make the life easier for reviewers of your code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;null-values-and-nullable-columns&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#null-values-and-nullable-columns&#34;&gt;
	NULL values and nullable columns
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define columns as &lt;code&gt;NOT NULL&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a column is nullable, the NULL value must have exactly one meaning, and it must be documented (e.g. in a COMMENT clause in the CREATE TABLE statement).
More on &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/08/25/null-is-null.html&#34;&gt;NULL values&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are using &lt;code&gt;LEFT JOIN&lt;/code&gt; or access columns that can be nullable, consider the SQL functions &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/comparison-operators.html#function_coalesce&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;COALESCE()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

, &lt;code&gt;IFNULL()&lt;/code&gt; and the comparison operator &lt;code&gt;IS NULL&lt;/code&gt;.
NULL values do not compare normally, so wrap nullables into one of these functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;default-values&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#default-values&#34;&gt;
	Default values
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;avoid &lt;code&gt;DEFAULT&lt;/code&gt; values&lt;/strong&gt;, except for natural &amp;ldquo;zero&amp;rdquo; values appropriate for the type.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for &lt;code&gt;DEFAULT&lt;/code&gt; date and time values, &lt;strong&gt;see the section on date and time values&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;boolean&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#boolean&#34;&gt;
	Boolean
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;TINYINT&lt;/code&gt; to store booleans.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MySQL &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/other-vendor-data-types.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;does not have a native boolean type&lt;/a&gt;

, so we use &lt;code&gt;TINYINT&lt;/code&gt;.
It uses one byte.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clever hacks exist to exploit nullability (&lt;code&gt;CHAR(0) NULL&lt;/code&gt; columns) or bitfields to store data more densely.
These usually backfire later in the software development lifecycle.
Avoid them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;integers&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#integers&#34;&gt;
	Integers
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always use &lt;code&gt;integer&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;bigint&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MySQL offers several integer data types smaller than the 4-byte &lt;code&gt;integer&lt;/code&gt; and the 8-byte &lt;code&gt;bigint&lt;/code&gt;.
They have been used in the past, and usually later created an upgrade problem when the data range was exhausted in company growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not use display widths with integers.&lt;/strong&gt; Use &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;int(11)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fractional-numbers-and-monetary-values&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#fractional-numbers-and-monetary-values&#34;&gt;
	Fractional numbers and monetary values
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always choose &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;. Never use &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;FLOAT&lt;/code&gt; is a 32 bit floating point number, and the range and precision is usually too small to be useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past some projects have stored pricing information as &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;.
This comes with its own set of problems.
Consider using an appropriately sized &lt;code&gt;DECIMAL(16,4)&lt;/code&gt; variant, but be aware what the systems you depend on and the systems depending on you use.
Compatibility may be better than correctness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For euro-values, use a column name suffix &amp;ldquo;_eur&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;char-varchar-and-the-various-text-types&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#char-varchar-and-the-various-text-types&#34;&gt;
	CHAR, VARCHAR and the various TEXT types
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid &lt;code&gt;CHAR&lt;/code&gt;, prefer &lt;code&gt;VARCHAR&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In very old versions of MySQL the &lt;code&gt;CHAR&lt;/code&gt; type had certain speed advantages.
None of these are true any more for modern MySQL using InnoDB.
Do not use fixed width character types anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider row width, and slightly prefer &lt;code&gt;VARCHAR&lt;/code&gt; over &lt;code&gt;TEXT&lt;/code&gt; types.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;VARCHAR&lt;/code&gt; are stored inline and contribute to row width, &lt;code&gt;TEXT&lt;/code&gt; types are stored like BLOBs and are stored in a complicated way that can have a lot of overhead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;VARCHAR&lt;/code&gt; for string-like texts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;TEXT&lt;/code&gt; where you actually store small &amp;lsquo;files&amp;rsquo; in the database.
If you do that, see below the notes on &lt;code&gt;BLOB&lt;/code&gt; data.
They also apply here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use the default &lt;code&gt;utf8mb4&lt;/code&gt; charset, it is the utf-8 you want.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;VARCHAR&lt;/code&gt; and the various &lt;code&gt;TEXT&lt;/code&gt; fields have a character set associated to them.
Always use &lt;code&gt;utf8mb4&lt;/code&gt; as the character set (it should be the default, but check).
Read up on &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/01/12/utf8mb4.html&#34;&gt;Why utf8mb4?&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid &lt;code&gt;ENUM&lt;/code&gt;, use lookup tables.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MySQL offers an &lt;code&gt;ENUM&lt;/code&gt; data type, and we have used this a lot in the past.
We found that removing values from an &lt;code&gt;ENUM&lt;/code&gt; is a very costly table change.
We recommend you use a lookup table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/09/18/mysql-encoding-fields-for-great-profit.html&#34;&gt;Encoding columns for great profit&lt;/a&gt;

 explains how converting string columns with low cardinality can pay off in shrinking the data size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;blobs-and-files-in-the-database&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#blobs-and-files-in-the-database&#34;&gt;
	BLOBs and files in the database
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Databases are not good file systems.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When reading values from disk, they pass on through the file system, the database server, are being converted into the column field data type the server uses internally, pushed again into the kernel into the network layer and then finally sent.
This involves making around three copies of the data, whereas using &lt;code&gt;sendfile()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;splice()&lt;/code&gt; to send a static file from the filesystem is zero copy.
Consider not using the database to store files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;max_allowed_packet is an absolute limit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All data MySQL handles must be smaller than the config value &lt;code&gt;max_allowed_packet&lt;/code&gt;, even if the field size allows for more.
In our systems that limit is 16 MB.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are ways around that, using string manipulation of very large strings.
This eats an insane amount of memory.
If you find yourself going down that route, stop and reconsider your design or life choices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In MySQL 8, handling &lt;code&gt;TEXT&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;BLOB&lt;/code&gt; is less costly, but still worthwhile checking.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the past, any result set that contained &lt;code&gt;TEXT&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;BLOB&lt;/code&gt; types, no matter how small, forced sort operations to spill to disk, making them slow.
This is no longer the case for the most recent versions of MySQL 8, but it is still useful in many cases to consider a two-step approach:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step 1: Run a query to select the primary key values you need in the order you need them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step 2: Run a second query of the form &lt;code&gt;SELECT id, blobcolumn FROM table WHERE id IN (...)&lt;/code&gt;, with the &lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt; containing a list of up to 1000 literal id values as constants to fetch the blob data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;BLOB&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;TEXT&lt;/code&gt; fields larger than 1 MB can saturate the network using replication and uses a lot of disk space.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MySQL is using row-based replication, and for each row changed will store a pre-image and post-image of the row on disk, for replication.
This is kept for up to seven days, to enable lagging replicas to catch up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each replica is then downloading this information, so for each changed 1MB field, 2 MB are copied to each instance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;date-and-time-values&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#date-and-time-values&#34;&gt;
	DATE and TIME values
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be aware of MySQLs awful date and time history.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The date and time types in MySQL have an awful history because of a number of very bad design decisions in the past.
Most of that is cleaned up by now, but we still see legacy problems in some places because of old data or old code.
What are the reasons for the bad things:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MySQL allowed partial dates, &amp;lsquo;2022-01-00&amp;rsquo; for &amp;ldquo;I do not know the day&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;lsquo;2022-00-00&amp;rsquo; for &amp;ldquo;I have no idea about month and day&amp;rdquo;.
They are no longer allowed (&lt;code&gt;NO_ZERO_IN_DATE&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MySQL allowed zero dates (&amp;lsquo;0000-00-00&amp;rsquo;), and conflated them with the &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; value.
This is no longer allowed (&lt;code&gt;NO_ZERO_DATES&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MySQL had a magic type &lt;code&gt;TIMESTAMP&lt;/code&gt; that in a magic position behaved magically.
Specifically, the leftmost &lt;code&gt;TIMESTAMP&lt;/code&gt; column was automatically set to &lt;code&gt;NOW()&lt;/code&gt; when it was not explicitly set to a value, but other columns of a row were changed.
This was used to implement &lt;code&gt;changed_at&lt;/code&gt; columns.
Today, you can apply this to any &lt;code&gt;DATETIME&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;TIMESTAMP&lt;/code&gt; in any position, using an explicit &lt;code&gt;ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP&lt;/code&gt; clause.
There are lots of special rules and exceptions that document past behavior and an attempt at compatibility and migration. &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/timestamp-initialization.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The manual on the state of things&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MySQL &lt;code&gt;DATE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;TIME&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DATETIME&lt;/code&gt; types do not deal with timezones.&lt;code&gt;TIMESTAMP&lt;/code&gt; does.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But only if the timezone tables in the mysql.* schema are initialized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The current timezone you are in is defined as a default for the server, and can be overridden as a connection property.
It is likely not a good idea to do that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can shoot yourself in the foot with timezones, DST boundaries and interval arithmetic. &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/04/02/making-an-unexpected-leap-with-interval-syntax.html&#34;&gt;How that happens&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prefer &lt;code&gt;DATETIME&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;TIMESTAMP&lt;/code&gt;, unless it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;changed_at&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The range of &lt;code&gt;TIMESTAMP&lt;/code&gt; is limited and has a year 2038 problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DATETIME, TIME and TIMESTAMP can have microsecond resolution if desired.&lt;/strong&gt; In MySQL, &lt;code&gt;DATETIME&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;TIME&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;TIMESTAMP&lt;/code&gt; can have fractional resolutions up to microsecond resolution. To get that, specify a precision such as &lt;code&gt;DATETIME(6)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;TIME(6)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;TIMESTAMP(6)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use minimum and maximum values as boundaries in time ranges.&lt;/strong&gt; If you define time ranges, use field names such as &lt;code&gt;valid_from&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;valid_until&lt;/code&gt;. If you are using &lt;code&gt;DATETIME&lt;/code&gt; types for that, use &lt;code&gt;1000-01-01 00:00:00&lt;/code&gt; for &amp;ldquo;minus infinity&amp;rdquo; and &lt;code&gt;9999-12-31 23:59:59&lt;/code&gt; for &amp;ldquo;plus infinity&amp;rdquo;, as these are the minimum and maximum values for this type. Do not use &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; values, as they will not compare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be aware that the SQL &lt;code&gt;BETWEEN&lt;/code&gt; operator is a closed interval (&lt;code&gt;WHERE id BETWEEN 4 and 7&lt;/code&gt; will return 4, 5, 6 and 7), and you often want half-open interval (&lt;code&gt;WHERE now() &amp;gt;= valid_from AND now() &amp;lt; valid_until&lt;/code&gt;). &lt;strong&gt;Avoid using BETWEEN to avoid ambiguity of the nature of the interval and assumptions on the code readers side.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#json-data-type&#34;&gt;
	JSON data type
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MySQL 8 provides JSON functions.
They are a bit clunky, but work very well.
When using JSON functions, also learn about generated columns and virtual indexes.
This is new functionality in MySQL 8, and that means it is less tested than other code.

.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;JSON&lt;/code&gt; in MySQL always uses the &lt;code&gt;utf8&lt;/code&gt; character set.
This is a bug, it should be using &lt;code&gt;utf8mb4&lt;/code&gt;, but currently not fixed.
The effect is that Emoji and other letters with 4-byte UTF-8 encodings cannot be used there.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ip_address&lt;/strong&gt;  varbinary(16), because IPv6 is a thing. Check out &lt;code&gt;INET6_ATON()&lt;/code&gt; and virtual indexes on generated columns as a convenience. &lt;code&gt;SELECT ...

    &lt;a href=&#34;#foreign-key-constraints&#34;&gt;
	Foreign Key Constraints
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid foreign key constraints, unless you are in a department that specifically requires you use them.&lt;/strong&gt;
MySQL allows you to define foreign key constraints.
They come at a price:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foreign key constraints can only refer to columns in the same database instance, but our schemas have more data than fits into a single schema, and often requires you work across database instances using multiple handles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foreign key constraints are always immediate.
That means they are checked at the end of each statement, not at the end of a transaction (&amp;ldquo;deferred&amp;rdquo;), forcing an order to your SQL statements inside a transaction.
This is often inconvenient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foreign key constraints require additional lookups and additional locks.
This can lead to lock escalation and a higher deadlock rate, impacting throughput.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With foreign key constraints it is possible to create undeletable and unupdatable rows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foreign Key Constraints with &lt;code&gt;ON UPDATE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ON DELETE&lt;/code&gt; clauses can cause spooky action at a distance, and can also cause large bulk deletes and updates that will break replication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foreign Key Constraints break all tooling we have for Online Schema Change and for automated database splits.
Table changes become extremely toil for everyone involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foreign Key Constraints break Group Replication, which we depend on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of that we recommend you do not use foreign key constraints.
They usually provide a lot of toil and little benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exceptions exist. Check your departments engineering guides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;transactions&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#transactions&#34;&gt;
	Transactions
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep transaction runtime short.&lt;/strong&gt; Long-running transactions will build a large Undo log and slow down the database for everyone.
A transaction taking fractions of a second is fast, a transaction being kept open for minutes or even hours is not. &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2019/11/18/a-blast-from-the-past.html&#34;&gt;The effect of long-running transactions on performance&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep transaction size in the range of 1000 to 10000 rows for batch loading.&lt;/strong&gt;
Larger transactions are incompatible with group replication, and also will not provide speedup.
Smaller transactions cause excessive sync to disk, and are not fast. &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/07/27/mysql-commit-size-and-speed.html&#34;&gt;Commit size and write speed&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use the default transaction isolation level REPEATABLE READ.&lt;/strong&gt;
There were use-cases for READ COMMITTED in the past, but with &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/blog-archive/mysql-8-0-1-using-skip-locked-and-nowait-to-handle-hot-rows/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT ... SKIP LOCKED&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

 in MySQL 8 and row based replication, most of these are gone. &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/07/29/mysql-transactions-the-logical-view.html&#34;&gt;What are isolation levels?&lt;/a&gt;

,  &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/07/30/mysql-transactions---writing-data.html&#34;&gt;Proper counters with locking&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To start a transaction, MySQL offers several semi-equivalent syntax variants: &lt;code&gt;BEGIN&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;BEGIN WORK&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;START TRANSACTION READ WRITE&lt;/code&gt;. Check what your ORM is using.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only &lt;code&gt;START TRANSACTION READ WRITE&lt;/code&gt; should be used.&lt;/strong&gt; It is the only syntax that signals write-intent or read-intent (&lt;code&gt;START TRANSACTION READ ONLY&lt;/code&gt;) in the opening statement, and hence the only statement that load balances properly in ProxySQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ProxySQL will have to assume write-intent in all cases if &lt;code&gt;BEGIN&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;BEGIN WORK&lt;/code&gt; are being used. This will run even read-only transactions on the primary, and scale badly, unless two application database handles are being used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#idempotent-queries&#34;&gt;
	Idempotent Queries
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Databases have transactions.
It is not strictly necessary to formulate queries as replayable (idempotent).
Things that are being wrapped in a transaction will all either execute together or not at all, and once the commit returns successfully the data is guaranteed to be persisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, &lt;strong&gt;it is useful to use replayable forms of write-queries because they are more resilient&lt;/strong&gt; and make certain recovery operations easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;read-modify-write-counters-and-select--for-update&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#read-modify-write-counters-and-select--for-update&#34;&gt;
	Read-Modify-Write, Counters and &lt;code&gt;SELECT ... FOR UPDATE&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common scenario in transactional databases is making a change to an existing record, for example updating a description, incrementing a counter or changing the state of a work item in a state machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can think of that as &amp;ldquo;taking a value temporarily out of the table&amp;rdquo; (like lending a book from a library) by locking it, making the change in the application, and then putting it back by running the actual update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The correct way to do this is to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start a transaction using &lt;code&gt;START TRANSACTION READ WRITE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read the value to be modified by using &lt;code&gt;SELECT ... FOR UPDATE&lt;/code&gt;, in order to not only select the row in question, but also pre-lock it the way a later write would. &lt;code&gt;SELECT ... FOR UPDATE&lt;/code&gt; is a read statement, but applies X-locks like an &lt;code&gt;UPDATE&lt;/code&gt;. This is &amp;ldquo;taking the value temporarily out of the table&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can now make changes to the record in application memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then run &lt;code&gt;UPDATE ... SET ...&lt;/code&gt; to write the change back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On &lt;code&gt;COMMIT&lt;/code&gt; the change will be persisted and the lock will be dropped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is called a read-modify-write (RMW) transaction, and is the correct way to achieve such multi-statement changes atomically.
You need to find out how your ORM creates RMW transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is discussed at length in &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/07/30/mysql-transactions---writing-data.html&#34;&gt;MySQL Transactions (Read-Modify-Write)&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure &lt;code&gt;START TRANSACTION&lt;/code&gt; syntax is being used, not &lt;code&gt;BEGIN&lt;/code&gt; syntax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;COMMIT&lt;/code&gt; can fail, you must check success and be prepared to re-run the entire transaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A transaction must not extend across a user interaction. You must not &lt;code&gt;SELECT ... FOR UPDATE&lt;/code&gt; and then wait for user input. A transaction must be finished in fractions of a second.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;optimistic-locking&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#optimistic-locking&#34;&gt;
	Optimistic locking
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To ensure record identity across user interaction, optimistic locking is commonly used.&lt;/strong&gt; The problem to solve is: We load a record into the application memory and then let the user perform changes. We need to write the changes back, but the record may have been simultaneously changed by a second connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot take an X-lock on the record and keep record ownership for a long time across a user interaction, because that will destroy performance in many ways (Imagine a user opening the edit screen and then going on vacation or even just a lunch break).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two common ways to solve this, which are collectively called &amp;ldquo;optimistic locking&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You write back the change in an update where you guard the &lt;code&gt;UPDATE&lt;/code&gt; with the full set of old column values in the update: &lt;code&gt;UPDATE t SET col1=new_value1, col2=new_value2, ... WHERE col1=old_value1, col2=old_value2, ...&lt;/code&gt;. The update will fail and not change any row, if any old value has changed since we loaded the original row into the editor presented to the user. It is then possible to present the change to the user and let them resolve the conflict.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similarly, we can have version numbers in each row, and guard the update with the version number. &lt;code&gt;UPDATE t SET col1=changed_value, version=old_version+1 WHERE id=pk_value AND version=old_version&lt;/code&gt;. The update can happen on the combination of &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt;, and will fail if the version changed while we were waiting for user input.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is important for the version number to be &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; part of the primary key, because otherwise we get versioned entries in our data table. This is usually not a desirable trait in transactional systems (see &lt;em&gt;Tombstones&lt;/em&gt; elsewhere).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;job-queues-and-skip-locked&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#job-queues-and-skip-locked&#34;&gt;
	Job Queues (and SKIP LOCKED)
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MySQL is not actually a queueing system. &lt;strong&gt;Talk to Kafka about queues and do not use MySQL as one.&lt;/strong&gt; Using MySQL as a queue will deliver &amp;ldquo;exactly once delivery&amp;rdquo; of jobs, at the cost of at least one disk write per enqueue and dequeue, which translates into fantastic monetary values in a cloud environment by the way of very high IOPS values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MySQL has been used as a queue &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/01/28/database-as-a-queue.html&#34;&gt;in some scenarios on bare metal&lt;/a&gt;

, because it is so obvious and convenient. Looking at the cloud, avoid that and use a proper queue service for your problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you must use MySQL as a queue, at least &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/07/13/mysql-a-job-queue-in-python.html&#34;&gt;do it right&lt;/a&gt;

, and lock properly using &lt;code&gt;SKIP LOCKED&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For writing to MySQL and Kafka, consider the Outbox pattern (&lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/09/01/outbox-pattern-apache-kafka-and-debezium&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Outbox pattern&lt;/a&gt;

) and talk to the Kafka team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sorting&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#sorting&#34;&gt;
	Sorting
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Database servers are often more expensive and centralized machines compared to their clients, and harder to scale. We have found that is it useful to &lt;strong&gt;sort in the client where it makes sense&lt;/strong&gt; instead of using &lt;code&gt;ORDER BY&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;subqueries&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#subqueries&#34;&gt;
	Subqueries
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prefer &lt;code&gt;JOIN&lt;/code&gt; over subqueries.&lt;/strong&gt; MySQL 8 is better at optimizing subqueries than older versions of MySQL, but it is usually still safer to write a &lt;code&gt;JOIN&lt;/code&gt; than to use the equivalent subquery syntax. If you come from Red Oracle, you have learned things to be the other way around and need to adjust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is especially true for subqueries with negations (&lt;code&gt;WHERE NOT EXIST&lt;/code&gt;) to find missing values. Use a &lt;code&gt;LEFT JOIN&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;IS NULL&lt;/code&gt; on a right-hand side value to achieve the same result much faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tombstones-is_deleted-flags&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#tombstones-is_deleted-flags&#34;&gt;
	Tombstones (&lt;code&gt;is_deleted&lt;/code&gt; flags)
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid Tombstones.&lt;/strong&gt; Tombstones are a per-row flag that marks a row as deleted. All queries to the table need their &lt;code&gt;WHERE&lt;/code&gt;-clause to be amended by a &lt;code&gt;AND is_deleted = 0&lt;/code&gt; term or similar to find only non-deleted rows. Tombstones are usually not a good idea.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The old data will increase the size of the active transactional table. This will increase the working set of the database, and require a larger instance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tombstone flag needs to be indexed, or even become part of the primary key, in order to eliminate dead rows quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The MTTR of the system after failure is higher because the database is larger, being bloated with dead data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually physically deleting the tombstone data is a cumbersome process when done in large batches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is usually preferable to build transactional systems that are small and contain only life data in transactional tables.&lt;/strong&gt; Log data with temporary structure should at least go to other tables with log nature, or even to different machines that are handling the archival log and are not part of the critical, transactional production scope.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can write records to the transactional table. When they retire, instead of deleting, move them to a log table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can double write records on creation to the transactional table and the log table, then mirror the entire lifecycle on both tables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Typical scenarios where Tombstones are deadly:&lt;/strong&gt; A queue-like structure in a table (&amp;ldquo;Picklists&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Producer/Consumer Scenarios&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;State machines in a table&amp;rdquo;)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is sometimes okay to keep old inventory records around in a lookup table if there is a chance that items elsewhere still refer to the deactivated inventory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In general, it is often useful in transactional systems to keep the working set aggressively small, and then keep non-critical data in other tables in the same system, or even in dedicated non-transactional systems. How little data do I need in order to be able to take their money successfully?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;partitions&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#partitions&#34;&gt;
	Partitions
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partitions are a way to split a large table internally into a number of small tables, while still presenting the interface of a single table to the user.
&lt;strong&gt;They may be useful for tables &amp;gt; 30 GB in size, a quarter of an instance&amp;rsquo;s memory size.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partitioning always works on the primary key, or the prefix of a compound (multi-column) primary key.
Internally, MySQL uses (a part of) the primary key to decide into which internal table (partition) to put the row.
The optimizer may use this to reduce the number of partitions to search when running queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, instead of deleting many rows individually, it may be possible to speed up some deletions by running an &lt;code&gt;ALTER TABLE ... DROP PARTITION ...&lt;/code&gt; to quickly remove data.
On the other hand, running DDL queries in the normal application workflow likely is going to need a compliance exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partitions can work on a &lt;code&gt;RANGE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;LIST&lt;/code&gt; of column values, or on a hash function (&lt;code&gt;KEY&lt;/code&gt; uses a system-supplied hash, &lt;code&gt;HASH&lt;/code&gt; uses a user-supplied function).
&lt;code&gt;RANGE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;LIST&lt;/code&gt; can speed up queries by enabling the optimizer to eliminate partitions before access. &lt;code&gt;HASH&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;KEY&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ldquo;spray&amp;rdquo; data across many partitions, and can make insertion faster and more even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk to a DBA about planning proper partitioning, taking your workload and access pattern into account.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#using-mysql-in-a-replication-environment&#34;&gt;
	Using MySQL in a replication environment
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our MySQL is always &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/03/24/a-lot-of-mysql.html&#34;&gt;in a treelike replication structure&lt;/a&gt;

 to place read copies of the data close to the application. This provides low latency data access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writes always go to the root of the replication tree, the current primary.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your application has access to segregated read and write handles for database access.
&lt;strong&gt;Make sure you are using the proper handle.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replication speed is mostly a function of workload.&lt;/strong&gt; DBAs can keep replication running, but they cannot really make a server replicate faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use replication-aware bulk functions.&lt;/strong&gt; Your database access library has functions to prevent overloading a replication hierarchy. Use them, and when they don&amp;rsquo;t work - &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;don’t get creative, get help&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DBAs can indeed speed up replication by changing the server configuration to a mode where disk writes are not properly persisted. By writing to disk less the server can replicate faster, at the cost of losing data should there be a fail-over situation while this configuration is active. This is known as &amp;ldquo;YOLO&amp;rdquo;-Mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our MySQL topology is managed by a program called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.percona.com/blog/2016/03/08/orchestrator-mysql-replication-topology-manager/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Orchestrator&lt;/a&gt;

.
Orchestrator takes care of Primaries and Intermediate Servers failing, rearranging the surviving members into a valid replication tree.
It also informs our server discovery mechanisms of the change.
This means:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your application cannot rely on write- and read-handles pointing to static machines, when DNS is used.
&lt;strong&gt;You must re-resolve hostnames immediately before reconnecting.&lt;/strong&gt;
You must make sure that your code does not internally cache DNS query results (Java!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MySQL typically does not use much CPU.
Servers with high CPU usage are having one of three problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Queries not using indexes, scanning a table completely, in memory.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify the query not using indexes and fix the schema or the query (see below).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excessive sorting in the server.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If possible, access the data in index order, or do the sorting in the client where it scales better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code in the database is being run (i.e. somebody has been using stored procedures, stored functions or similar)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Destroy the codebase and start over from scratch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	Finding problematic queries using Vividcortex
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On many replication hierarchies we have probes running that log query data into &amp;ldquo;Solarwinds DPM&amp;rdquo; (previously known as VividCortex).
If you do not have access or your replication hierarchy has no probes, contact DBA.&lt;/p&gt;

	Finding problematic queries using &lt;code&gt;sys.*&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All database servers by default have installed a series of views in &lt;code&gt;sys.*&lt;/code&gt;.
These read data from &lt;code&gt;performance_schema.*&lt;/code&gt; (P_S for short), which is partially enabled on all machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P_S is documented in &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema.html&lt;/a&gt;

.
It is optimized for logging performance data without impacting performance much.
It is not optimized for access by humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;sys.*&lt;/code&gt; (sys for short) is fixing that, presenting a number of useful views on P_S, for human consumption and reporting.
sys is documented in &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sys-schema.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sys-schema.html&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All views in sys exist in two variants: the regular variant for humans (&lt;code&gt;sys.host_summary_by_file_io&lt;/code&gt;) and the &lt;code&gt;x$&lt;/code&gt; variant presenting unabridged data at full resolution for reporting (&lt;code&gt;sys.x$host_summary_by_file_io&lt;/code&gt;).
Numbers in the regular variant are shortened and suffixed with units (&amp;ldquo;15m&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;100k&amp;rdquo;) or transformed into human time scales (runtime &lt;code&gt;01:02:03&lt;/code&gt;). Numbers in &lt;code&gt;x$&lt;/code&gt; views are presented raw.
It is useful to work interactively with the regular variants and the run the final report on the &lt;code&gt;x$&lt;/code&gt; variant for full data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that meaningful performance data can be gathered only on production instances, but you can craft performance insight queries on test instances easily.
You will then need to run these on production instances to actually get production performance data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common cause for slow query execution is &amp;ldquo;missing indexes&amp;rdquo;.
Once you have identified queries with slow execution time using Solarwinds DPM or sys, run the &lt;code&gt;explain&lt;/code&gt; command on them to see their execution plan.
Refer to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.slideshare.net/isotopp/explaining-explain&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Explaining EXPLAIN: Queries and what happens when you execute them&lt;/a&gt;

) to better understand what goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most commonly, one of these things needs fixing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add missing indexes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;formulate a query with dependent subqueries to use some kind of join&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;formulate a query with multiple range clauses in a way that resolves in multiple steps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DBA can help you with this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mismatching-types&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#mismatching-types&#34;&gt;
	Mismatching types
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A longstanding problem in MySQL was a type mismatch in a join.
If you have a query with a &lt;code&gt;a JOIN b ON a.col1 = b.col1&lt;/code&gt;, and the instances of &lt;code&gt;col1&lt;/code&gt; in the two tables have incompatible (different, and not coercible) types, an index cannot be used to resolve the query, even if it exists.
That is, if &lt;code&gt;col1&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;varchar&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, but an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, the join will be slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem can also often be provoked in a &lt;code&gt;WHERE&lt;/code&gt; clause such as &lt;code&gt;WHERE a.col1 = &amp;quot;value&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, with &lt;code&gt;a.col1&lt;/code&gt;
being integer, and &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;value&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; written as a string literal due to the quotes.
Again, an index, even if it exists, won&amp;rsquo;t be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bad-paging&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#bad-paging&#34;&gt;
	Bad Paging
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(based on an idea from Yves Orton)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The query &lt;code&gt;SELECT id FROM Whatever LIMIT 10360000,10000&lt;/code&gt; is an example of paging, where a user or a script want to read a large, full result set in chunks of 10k.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not an efficient practice, as the database has to execute the same query over and over.
It may be able to apply some mild optimizations for low limit values (at the start of the paging), but eventually it will have to reproduce large parts of the full table, handing out fragments of 10k rows.
On top of that, MySQL represents result sets internally in a linked list, so &lt;code&gt;LIMIT&lt;/code&gt; clauses with large offset values are very inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could instead fetch one row more, while reading in table native order.
This will get of the offset part in the &lt;code&gt;LIMIT&lt;/code&gt; clause.
It will not have to physically sort, as the table is read in native primary key order.
And it will only access actual 10k fragments of the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Whatever&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;order&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;limit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;10001&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We output 10k values, and take the final value as a new starting point &lt;code&gt;lastid&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Whatever&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;lastid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;order&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;limit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;10001&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a developer using Python, I want to be able to hand a &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; to SQL with a &lt;code&gt;WHERE id IN (…)&lt;/code&gt; clause, and it should do the right thing.
This can be done by using a prepared statement like &lt;code&gt;SELECT .... WHERE `foo` IN %s ...&lt;/code&gt; and passing in a &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; or a &lt;code&gt;tuple&lt;/code&gt;
for the placeholder variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important caveats:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are no &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; in the prepared statement after the &lt;code&gt;IN&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tuple&lt;/code&gt; will work, no other iterables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a developer using Python, I want to be able to trace the SQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;support&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#support&#34;&gt;
	Support
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;host-version-user&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#host-version-user&#34;&gt;
	Host, Version, User
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DBA will have a much easier time in helping you, if you have the output of the following query ready when you ask them about your SQL performance problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;@@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;hostname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;@@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will tell them the actual instance hostname, the precise version string of the database and the username (and by inference, the permissions) you are using to connect.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Debugging SQL in Python</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When using MySQL with Python, you may want to use the &lt;code&gt;mysqlclient&lt;/code&gt; library, which is what most people do and which will work just fine.
Or you are using the official MySQL 8 Connector/Python package, which will behave slightly differently, but maybe supports the unique MySQL 8 feature already that is not in &lt;code&gt;mysqlclient&lt;/code&gt;, yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your SQL may be hand-writtten, or it may be generated using SQL Alchemy, Django or some other package.
If the latter is the case, it may be useful to be able to see the actual SQL string that has been sent to the database in order to facilitate interactive debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;using-mysqlclient&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#using-mysqlclient&#34;&gt;
	Using mysqlclient
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are using &lt;code&gt;mysqlclient&lt;/code&gt; with Python, the class internally sends the SQL to the server in a method &lt;code&gt;_query(self, q)&lt;/code&gt; in the Cursor class (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/PyMySQL/mysqlclient/blob/6ebc1a1972dee69fb54b56867fc795ee220b5d79/MySQLdb/cursors.py#L206&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;

).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;_query(self, q)&lt;/code&gt; method itself updates an &lt;code&gt;_executed&lt;/code&gt; member of the cursor to store the literal query string sent to the server.
But it does so only after having sent the query.
On error, an exception is raised and &lt;code&gt;_executed&lt;/code&gt; is not updated (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/PyMySQL/mysqlclient/blob/6ebc1a1972dee69fb54b56867fc795ee220b5d79/MySQLdb/cursors.py#L316&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;

).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To always get access to the actual query string, define a class &lt;code&gt;DebugCursor&lt;/code&gt;, and specify it with your connnection &lt;code&gt;**kwargs&lt;/code&gt;. In &lt;code&gt;DebugCursor&lt;/code&gt;, do the needful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ch&#34;&gt;#! /usr/bin/env python3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;MySQLdb&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;MySQLdb.cursors&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nc&#34;&gt;DebugCursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;MySQLdb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cursors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;DictCursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;_query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;bp&#34;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sa&#34;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Debug: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;_query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our class &lt;code&gt;DebugCursor&lt;/code&gt;, we inherit from our cursor of choice.
We override &lt;code&gt;_query(self, q)&lt;/code&gt;, printing the query string &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt;, and then calling the parent class implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; python3 probe.py

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can use this to trace-log all literal SQL before it is being executed, even if the query string is invalid or contains syntax errors.&lt;/p&gt;

	Using MySQL Connector/Python
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are using Oracle MySQL Connnector/Python to connect to the database, the implementation can internally use Cython or a Pure Python implementation of the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both implementations behave slightly differently, unfortunately.
Only the Pure Python implementation can be debugged easily in all circumstances.
It is therefore important that you specify &lt;code&gt;use_pure=True&lt;/code&gt; with your connnection &lt;code&gt;**kwargs&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The raw SQL statement will be found in the cursor&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;_executed&lt;/code&gt; member.
If you are using multi-statements (don&amp;rsquo;t!), they will be logged in the &lt;code&gt;_executed_list&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;mysql.connector&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;mysql.connector.errors&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;db_config&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The output looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; python3 probe.py
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;=== Valid SQL:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;Debug: b&amp;#39;select d from testtable where id = 3&amp;#39;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;[(&amp;#39;drei&amp;#39;,)]

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;=== Invalid SQL:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;Debug: b&amp;#39;syntaxerror d from testtable where id = 3&amp;#39;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;Error: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near &amp;#39;syntaxerror d from testtable where id = 3&amp;#39; at line 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, we can use this to trace raw SQL and identify actual generated SQL syntax much easier.
This will allow us to pick up the literal SQL string, and debug interactively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same program, when run without &lt;code&gt;use_pure=True&lt;/code&gt;, will not update &lt;code&gt;c._executed&lt;/code&gt; properly if the SQL is malformed.
It will produce the following output, which is worthless for debugging:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; python3 probe.py
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;=== Valid SQL:

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;[(&amp;#39;drei&amp;#39;,)]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;=== Invalid SQL:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;Debug: b&amp;#39;select d from testtable where id = 3&amp;#39;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;Error: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near &amp;#39;syntaxerror d from testtable where id = 3&amp;#39; at line 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note how &lt;code&gt;c._executed&lt;/code&gt; still holds the previous statement and not the statement that actually errored.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Truncated incorrect DOUBLE value</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I record this for posteriority without much comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The error message &amp;ldquo;Truncated incorrect DOUBLE value&amp;rdquo; when issued by MySQL can be a confused parser, and masks unintended barely legal syntax:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;kris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;localhost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;kris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;testtable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, an &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; is possible and legal, if you wanted to produce a &lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt;.
Most people do not want this at this point in the statement, though.
The error message is particularly unhelpful if you have no access to the literal raw SQL string for whatever reason.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Databases: How large is too large?</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/02/16/databases-how-large-is-too-large.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/02/16/databases-how-large-is-too-large.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A database is a special kind of structured, persistent, global variable with concurrent access over the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You write data to a cell of a row of a table in a schema in the server, and it is being kept around for you, with a lifetime longer than the runtime of your program.
The database takes care of making sure of ordering access to that data, so there is a clearly defined series of changes to the data – locking, transactions, isolation are things that make databases popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so one gets to have a lot of database schemas in server instances, and they grow.
Sometimes that becomes a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;databases-dont-scale-even-when-they-scale&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#databases-dont-scale-even-when-they-scale&#34;&gt;
	Databases don&amp;rsquo;t scale, even when they scale
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, the MySQL server can easily utilize the resources even of very large servers.
At work, we have taken instances easily up to 400.000 queries per second on AMD EPYC servers with 64 cores and one terabyte of memory, without special tuning.
With careful tuning, more than a million QPS is achievable.
MySQL scales extremely well these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time, MySQL also has been a very low latency/high connection database:
since it uses a multithreading approach with a pre-generated thread pool, it can handle up to around 10k connections comfortably, and three times more at cost.
It can handle disconnect and reconnect situations in a way that is more reminiscent of an LDAP server than a database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it can answer single point primary key lookups from memory – the workload a &lt;code&gt;memcached&lt;/code&gt; handles – at &lt;code&gt;memcached&lt;/code&gt; speeds:
We see query resolution times including SQL parsing that are as low as 0.12ms (120µs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-doesnt-scale-_server-creation-time_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-doesnt-scale-_server-creation-time_&#34;&gt;
	What doesn&amp;rsquo;t scale: &lt;em&gt;server creation time&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MySQL replication hierarchies are designed as shared-nothing architectures.
Creating a new server means you have to copy the data for the server into place, and then let replication catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are storage trickeries that can be played, but they have long term consequences that need mitigation.
They also tie their user to very costly and very specific storage architectures and that is not a thing anybody can afford to have as a technical debt item on their sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-relativity-theory-of-databases-for-data-space-is-time&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#a-relativity-theory-of-databases-for-data-space-is-time&#34;&gt;
	A Relativity Theory of databases: For data, space is time.
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we create new databases, we copy the data over.
In the end, the network is very fast:
At 10  Gbit/s, we are looking at a stream of 1.25 GB/s coming in that we need to be able to persist at the receiving end, and that we need to provide at the sending end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at storage, we can see that in all but one situation, the bottleneck is not the network:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A conventional HDD with rotating rust can serve reliably around 200 MB/s in a linear read or write (&lt;a href=&#34;https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/ap-en/storage/product/data-center-enterprise/cloud-scale-capacity/articles/mg07acaxxx.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Toshiba HDD specs&lt;/a&gt;

 provide some reference).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A SSD usually gives us twice this, so we see streams of around 400-500 MB/s (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.micron.com/-/media/client/global/documents/products/product-flyer/5300_product_brief.pdf?la=en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Micron SSD specs&lt;/a&gt;

 provide some reference).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Openstack instances are quota&amp;rsquo;ed, and often get something like 400 MB/s quota again, which nicely matches expectations of SSD users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A NVME flash device can provide on the upside of 3000 MB/s (3 GB/s) sustained data rate when enterprise grade hardware is purchased (&lt;a href=&#34;http://brochure.stebis.nl/Micron9300.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Micron NVME specs&lt;/a&gt;

 provide some reference).
This is the one single case where a 10 GBit/s network interface actually is becoming a bottleneck, but of course more network is available if you have the coin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How long does it take to copy one Terabyte of data, assuming linear streaming access?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At 200 MB/s, we get 12000 MB/min = ~12 GB/min, or around 85.3 minutes for 1024 GB.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At 400 MB/s, that is twice the speed or half the time, 42.6 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add time for replication to catch up, and round up to a nice round number for rule of thumb estimates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 400 MB/s, copying one Terabyte of data takes 45 minutes to copy and 15 minutes for replication catchup, for a total of &lt;strong&gt;one hour per Terabyte of data size&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;size-constraints-for-databases&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#size-constraints-for-databases&#34;&gt;
	Size constraints for databases
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In database land, we copy databases all the time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To make backups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To make more replicas in order to scale a pool up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To replace replicas that have left the pool to go into maintenance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To create special purpose replicas that may or may not be useful after having served their special purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each replica we make needs a donor instance, and often a donor instance can donate only to one receiver at a single point in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All taken together means that asking for more replicas is not instantaneous.
You will have to wait one hour per TB of data size, and longer if there is need to clone up some donors to be able to parallelize cloning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some good numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typical HPE or Dell blades at work have a single or two internal drives of 1.92 TB (&amp;ldquo;two TB&amp;rdquo;) each.
If the instances make full use of them, preparing a blade takes slightly under 2h or 4h.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a single workday of 8h, you can probably expect one attempt per day to do &amp;ldquo;a thing&amp;rdquo;  to a database of ~10 TB size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this we get a few very strong recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;200-250 GB&lt;/strong&gt; databases can be replicated in intervals that fit into K8s readiness probes.
That is why Vitess and also many Postgres based clustering products recommend small instance sizes of 250 GB or less.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2-4 TB&lt;/strong&gt; data size give you &amp;ldquo;several attempts at maintenance per day&amp;rdquo;, and also fit standard blade on premises or i3.2xl and i3.4xl instances in EC2.
They are probably the upper end of supportable database size in terms of wait times due to data copies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 TB&lt;/strong&gt; data size is where toil explodes, because they are in the &amp;ldquo;a single attempt per day&amp;rdquo; class.
If you have databases that are larger than this, you need to have a long and hard look at your life and architecture choices, and the implications of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;reactive-autoscaling-is-not-a-thing&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#reactive-autoscaling-is-not-a-thing&#34;&gt;
	Reactive autoscaling is not a thing
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also means that reactive autoscaling of database instances does not work at all:
By the time you have scaled up, the demand is already handled by existing capacity or you have died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need ongoing capacity testing and predictive autoscaling that gives you some headroom  for the unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using spot instances is also very likely to make you very unhappy or very offline or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;tldr&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#tldr&#34;&gt;
	TL;DR
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a soft 2 TB boundary and a hard 10 TB boundary.
They are defined by physics, so they are not negotiable and cannot be removed by throwing money at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you reach these sizes, talk to your DBA about alternatives.
Treat the 2TB boundary as a complexity inflection point, and use the remaining time as runway to branch out into alternative solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/01/12/utf8mb4.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Twitter, Jan Wildeboer &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jwildeboer/status/1481308177727729668&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt;

 an &lt;a href=&#34;https://adamhooper.medium.com/in-mysql-never-use-utf8-use-utf8mb4-11761243e434&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;article by Adam Hooper&lt;/a&gt;

 on MySQL and the weird &lt;code&gt;utf8mb4&lt;/code&gt; character set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recommendation is correct:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In MySQL, use &lt;code&gt;utf8mb4&lt;/code&gt; when you mean to work with &lt;code&gt;utf8&lt;/code&gt; in your programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The background and reasoning for this (and why it is wrong) is way more complicated than outlined by Adam Hooper.
So let&amp;rsquo;s walk through this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;mysql-utf8-means-3-byte-unicode-and-access-to-only-the-bmp&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#mysql-utf8-means-3-byte-unicode-and-access-to-only-the-bmp&#34;&gt;
	MySQL &lt;code&gt;utf8&lt;/code&gt; means 3-byte Unicode, and access to only the BMP
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;utf8&lt;/code&gt; in MySQL encodes the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_%28Unicode%29#Basic_Multilingual_Plane&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Unicode BMP&lt;/a&gt;

.
The Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane, or BMP, is the original 65536 character plane.
It was the only character plane available in Unicode 1.0
It was thought to be enough for all scripts in the world.
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unicode was extended, as early as with the 2.0 release, to have more characters than that, in more code planes.
Currently, there can be up to 17 Unicode planes, but most of them are unused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unicode 1.0 is also different in other ways. Vladislav Vaintroub commented to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unicode 1.0 had a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul_%28obsolete_Unicode_block%29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;different range for Hangul&lt;/a&gt;

.
Unicode 2.0 fixed that, and remapped Hangul (which is a unique action, and they issued a policy to forbid remapping in the future).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making things immutable is important with character sets and sort orders, also for databases, as we will see.
It is in fact the entire reason for &lt;code&gt;utf8mb4&lt;/code&gt; to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;encodings-and-the-65536-character-barrier&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#encodings-and-the-65536-character-barrier&#34;&gt;
	Encodings and the 65536 character barrier
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are various ways to encode codepoints of Unicode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, with only the BMP existing, people thought of extending the concept of &amp;ldquo;byte&amp;rdquo; = &amp;ldquo;character&amp;rdquo; to double bytes.
This is how you get the &lt;code&gt;wchar&lt;/code&gt; and a 16 bit character set, the obsolete ucs-2 encoding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it became clear that 65536 characters are insufficient to represent all scripts and languages in the world, a larger 31-bit space was introduced and the naive encoding of that, ucs-4.
This would require 4 bytes per character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both are incredibly wasteful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using ucs-2 with western scripts means that every other byte is a null byte, and with ucs-4 for every character there will be 3 null bytes.
Even with non-western scripts there will be at least one, if not two null bytes per character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extending Unicode beyond the BMP posed a bit of a problem:
Windows NT had started to use Unicode as a character set, and ucs-2 as the standard encoding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution was the character range 0xD800 to 0xDFFF, which was unassigned to characters, so far:
2048 (11 bit) of unassigned positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting encoding takes characters beyond the BMP, with codes greater than 0xFFFF, and subtracts 0x10000.
This leaves a 20 bit number, which is then split into a high 10 bit part and a low 10 bit part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The high ten bits are added to 0xd800 (0xd800-0xdbff).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The low then bits are added to 0xdc00 (0xdc00-0xdfff).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was called utf-16 encoding, and became the character set of Windows starting with Windows 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;utf-16 also, for now, limits the number of characters that can be represented in Unicode to 1112064, a number that can be represented in 21 bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plan-9-and-utf-8&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#plan-9-and-utf-8&#34;&gt;
	Plan 9 and utf-8
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Unix world, the experimental Plan 9 operating system from A&amp;amp;T explored variable length encodings of Unicode:
utf-8 could represent 31-bit Unicode with encodings between 1 and 6 bytes in length.
Single byte codes would be compatible with ASCII, so that valid ASCII is also valid utf-8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the utf-16 hack had restricted the number of possible Unicode characters effectively from 31 bit to 21 bit, actual utf-8 encodings can only be up to 4 bytes long.
And because utf-8 is so much denser than other encodings, it is by far the dominant encoding of Unicode.
Even Microsoft, heavily invested in ucs-2 and utf-16 with Windows, started to support utf-8, beginning with the development of Windows 11 in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an utf-8 multibyte sequence, the &amp;ldquo;number of 1-bits before the first 0-bit&amp;rdquo; in the first byte of a multibyte character determine the length of the encoding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single byte characters are in the range 0x00-0x7f (0 leading 1-bits, single byte), for ASCII compatibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multibyte characters start with &lt;code&gt;110xxxxx&lt;/code&gt; for a two byte sequence, &lt;code&gt;1110xxxx&lt;/code&gt; for a three byte sequence and &lt;code&gt;11110xxx&lt;/code&gt; for a four byte sequence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second, and possible third and fourth byte are all of the form &lt;code&gt;10xxxxxx&lt;/code&gt;, which is otherwise unused, so that these bytes are always identifiable as continuation bytes in a multibyte encoding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes utf-8 restartable:
If you end up at a byte of the form &lt;code&gt;10xxxxxx&lt;/code&gt;, you know you are in the middle of a multibyte sequence of at most 4 bytes length.
You can backtrack a few bytes, and check for the clearly recognizable start pattern of a multibyte encoding, or error out with an invalid encoding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get 128 single byte characters that are identical to ASCII, 1920 two byte characters, and three bytes for the rest of the BMP.
Four bytes are needed for rare CJK characters, a bunch of math, some dead scripts and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/11/05/unicode-is-over-and-it-dies-over-emoji.html&#34;&gt;a ton of emoji that should not exist in the first place&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mysql-and-three-byte-utf8&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#mysql-and-three-byte-utf8&#34;&gt;
	MySQL, and three byte &lt;code&gt;utf8&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MySQL did support the &amp;ldquo;full full&amp;rdquo; range of 31 bit Unicode in the beginning, with up to 6 bytes being used for a single character.
That was changed &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/commit/43a506c0ced0e6ea101d3ab8b4b423ce3fa327d0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;in a single byte change commit&lt;/a&gt;

 in September 2002.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://dri.es/the-history-of-mysql-ab&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Back then&lt;/a&gt;

 MySQL 3.23 was the active release and InnoDB was not yet enabled by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vladislav Vaintroub commented about this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway MySQL&amp;rsquo;s utf8 was always meant to be castrated utf8, from its invention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a little gamble, and hope that supplemental plane won&amp;rsquo;t be used much, thus we could save a couple of bytes in filesort.
Although already by 2001 (Unicode 3.1) there were characters in supplemental range, they could be seen as &amp;ldquo;rarely used&amp;rdquo; (music notation, old Egyptian, Deseret and what not).
Thus only few people needed supplemental characters, until everyone&amp;rsquo;s favorite U+1F4A9 PILE OF POO premiered in Unicode 6.0, in 2010, actually a couple of years after, until smartphone made emoji ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that gamble - that supplemental plane remains rarely used, did not work out, but who would know that by 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaintroub&amp;rsquo;s comment about sorting refers to a limitation of MySQL that was only removed in MySQL 8.
More about that below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;character-sets-have-collations&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#character-sets-have-collations&#34;&gt;
	Character sets have collations
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unicode not only defines character sets, they also define a comparison algorithm for characters.
This is called UCA, Unicode Comparison Algorithm.
Like Unicode itself, &lt;a href=&#34;https://unicode.org/Public/UCA/9.0.0/ReadMe.txt&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;it is versioned&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older versions of UCA had issues in various ways:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://lefred.be/content/mysql-character-sets-unicode-and-uca-compliant-collations/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;lefred&amp;rsquo;s Blog article&lt;/a&gt;

 and

 about the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=76553&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Sushi-Beer issue&lt;/a&gt;

 explain this in depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;indexes-are-materialized-collations&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#indexes-are-materialized-collations&#34;&gt;
	Indexes are materialized collations
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Databases have indexes, and these extract values from a column, &lt;strong&gt;sort them&lt;/strong&gt; and store back pointers to the full row with each extracted column value.
This allows for fast searching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, indexes are materialized collations, and when a collation (or a charset) is changed, all indexes that contain values of that charset are invalid and need to be recreated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the deep dark past, MySQL made changes and bugfixes to existing collations, which made MySQL upgrades a pain:
The moment you apply the upgrade, you are forced to drop and recreate the indexes.
Depending on the amount of data and the size of the index, that requires an extraordinary amount of time and makes updates complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;utf8mb4-because-utf8-was-taken&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#utf8mb4-because-utf8-was-taken&#34;&gt;
	&lt;code&gt;utf8mb4&lt;/code&gt;, because &lt;code&gt;utf8&lt;/code&gt; was taken.
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MySQL adopted a policy similar to the Unicode Consortium itself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MySQL never updates existing character sets and collations, not even for bugfixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And because the name &lt;code&gt;utf8&lt;/code&gt; was taken, a new name was needed:
&lt;code&gt;utf8mb4&lt;/code&gt; is the version of Unicode utf-8 in MySQL that extends past the BMP, and also uses UCA 9.0 for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare to &lt;code&gt;utf8&lt;/code&gt; which encodes only the BMP, and uses an older UCA for comparison.
So &lt;code&gt;utf8&lt;/code&gt; not only has a smaller character range, it also sorts differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes upgrades mich simpler:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You install a new version.
Nothing changes, you are just running new code which hopefully sorts and orders as before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can create new columns using the new character set and collations, even in existing tables, because in MySQL a charset and collation is a column attribute.
Tables, databases and servers just provide defaults that are inherited at the time of subordinate object creation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To complete the upgrade, check all columns, and note which ones need changing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually change these columns, table by table, at your own leisure.
If necessary, use tooling such as Percona Online Table Change (&amp;ldquo;OSC&amp;rdquo;), making the change in the background without service interruption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;side-note-mysqls-sorting-and-file-formats-are-portable&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#side-note-mysqls-sorting-and-file-formats-are-portable&#34;&gt;
	Side note: MySQL&amp;rsquo;s sorting and file formats are portable
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MySQL does not use &lt;code&gt;libc&lt;/code&gt; and the character set comparison functions in there for itself.
It brings its own collations instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is also an important fact.
It means that MySQL does not break when you upgrade the operating system &lt;code&gt;libc&lt;/code&gt; on your machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If MySQL used &lt;code&gt;libc&lt;/code&gt; fort sorting and comparing, the database could break without any changes to the database whatsoever &amp;ndash; an innocent security update to the operating system &lt;code&gt;libc&lt;/code&gt; (which for some reason also touched &lt;code&gt;libc&lt;/code&gt; sorting and comparison) would break all character indexes in your database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MySQL does not do that.
It lets you migrate these things in a way that is operationally convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also means that MySQL versions sort the same between Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris and even Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like the on disk format is compatible across all platforms, so is character handling and time zone handling.
MySQL is MySQL on any platform, and copying files and replication always work across these boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;so-why-the-6-to-3-byte-commit&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#so-why-the-6-to-3-byte-commit&#34;&gt;
	So why the 6-to-3-byte commit?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that it matters much: Because Unicode and UCA changes between versions of Unicode, you&amp;rsquo;d still have to use different names for character sets and collations, and migrations to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why was it important that &amp;ldquo;we could save a couple of bytes in filesort&amp;rdquo; as Vaintroub puts it?
Here we go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sorting-is-important-and-hard-to-scale&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#sorting-is-important-and-hard-to-scale&#34;&gt;
	Sorting is important, and hard to scale
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only can databases, tables and individual indexes be very large, they also need to be kept sorted, and sometimes data needs to be re-sorted.
Databases usually have a large number of strategies for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small things are sorted in memory.
That is, the database creates the full rows of the result table in memory, using all columns.
It then sorts these rows in memory by shuffling around the full rows.
That uses up a lot of memory bandwidth, because we copy around full rows, which can be large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we do not want to move around full rows, because these rows are large.
So we only sort the columns specified in the &lt;code&gt;ORDER BY CLAUSE&lt;/code&gt;, which is a tiny subset of the full columns set of each row of the result table, and attach a row pointer to each of these sort rows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end we have a tiny in-memory table in sort order, which only holds columns from the &lt;code&gt;ORDER BY&lt;/code&gt;, and each row in it points to the unsorted full rows somewhere else - in memory or on disk.
We can then output the full rows in sort order, but at the cost of a lot of seeks - possibly on disk.
That is, because the full rows have not been sorted, so the row pointers from the sorted data to the full rows are a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we have very many rows.
So we do as before, but for a subset of all rows - as many as fit into our sort buffer.
When the sort buffer is full, we write it out to disk.
Then we continue with the next batch.
Across all partial results we perform a merge sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the things sorted were full rows, we can emit full result rows rather quickly.
If the things sorted were only &lt;code&gt;ORDER BY&lt;/code&gt; columns or other partial result set rows with row pointers attached, we may have to perform one or multiple seeks in order to get the missing columns from all tables involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The optimizer has to decide which strategy to use here, based on estimates of the row width, size of the result set (which has not yet been produced, so it&amp;rsquo;s a guess) and the available amount of resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;and-then-implementation-issues&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#and-then-implementation-issues&#34;&gt;
	And then, implementation issues
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older versions of MySQL have different storage engines: &lt;code&gt;MYISAM&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;INNODB&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MEMORY&lt;/code&gt; and others.
Modern MySQL has only &lt;code&gt;INNODB&lt;/code&gt;, but for temporary tables has a few tricks ready to make things faster:
for example, temporary tables can be recreated and do not need to be crash safe, so no redo and undo logging is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other storage engines than &lt;code&gt;INNODB&lt;/code&gt; had restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;code&gt;MEMORY&lt;/code&gt; tables could not have variable length columns, there was no &lt;code&gt;VARCHAR&lt;/code&gt;, only &lt;code&gt;CHAR&lt;/code&gt;.
So when sorting with temporary tables in memory, MySQL created these temp tables as &lt;code&gt;MEMORY&lt;/code&gt; tables, promoting every &lt;code&gt;varchar(255)&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;CHAR(255)&lt;/code&gt;.
A row with a varchar value of &lt;code&gt;hello&lt;/code&gt; suddenly used 255 bytes instead of 6 bytes to represent the string &lt;code&gt;hello&lt;/code&gt; (plus a lot of padding).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, with &lt;code&gt;utf8&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code&gt;varchar(255) charset utf8&lt;/code&gt; is promoted to a &lt;code&gt;char(255) charset utf8&lt;/code&gt;, which instead allocates 765 bytes of memory, out of which the first five bytes contain the string &lt;code&gt;hello&lt;/code&gt;, and the rest is wasteful padding.
With 6 bytes, it would be twice that amount of memory.
So reducing this from 6 to 3 bytes was quite worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;MEMORY&lt;/code&gt; tables had a configurable size limit, and if your table exceeded that (which happened rather quickly, given the above restrictions), it was converted to an on-disk temporary table in &lt;code&gt;MYISAM&lt;/code&gt; format: a spill.
&lt;code&gt;MYISAM&lt;/code&gt; of course had &lt;code&gt;varchar(255) charset utf8&lt;/code&gt; as a native type, and your &lt;code&gt;hello&lt;/code&gt; would again shrink to six bytes.
Looking at the on disk temporary file, which was rather small, you might wonder what caused the spill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MySQL 8 introduces unlogged &lt;code&gt;INNODB&lt;/code&gt; temporary tables (and a failed experiment involving mmap that you may want to disable).
So this problem is gone, once and for all:
&lt;code&gt;varchar&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;varchar&lt;/code&gt; at all times, and representing Unicode variants in temporary tables is no longer a problem - if you use MySQL 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is in fact one of the major reasons to graduate from 5.7 for many people.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your programming languages &lt;code&gt;utf8&lt;/code&gt; is called &lt;code&gt;utf8mb4&lt;/code&gt; in MySQL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;utf8&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;utf8mb4&lt;/code&gt; sort differently due to changes in the Unicode Collation Algorithm (UCA).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indexes are physically materialized sort orders of column sets. They can become pretty large.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MySQL never changes character sets or collations, even if they are buggy. Instead a new collation with a new name is created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That is, because changing a sort order may require dropping and recreating an index, which is expensive if the index is large.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sorting things can be done in different ways, depending on data set size, column size and other considerations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementation details can make sorting even more complicated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MySQL 8 is a worthwhile upgrade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Databases manage state so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to. If you think databases are complicated, consider what you would have to do if the database and your DBA would not be there for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>MySQL: Moving Average</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/11/24/mysql-moving-average.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;MySQL window functions can be used to calculate daily averages or moving averages for a 24h time window relatively easily.
In an &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/06/21/mysql-window-functions.html&#34;&gt;earlier article&lt;/a&gt;

 basic window functions were already discussed.
In this article, we want to see how we can get daily buckets and moving averages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sample program is available, as usual, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/isotopp/mysql-dev-examples/blob/master/mysql-rolling-window/rolling-window.py&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;

	Getting sample data
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be working with a data table named &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;, with three columns: a sensor &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;, a measurement datetime &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; and a metric value &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; that was sampled at that time.
The table definition looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nd&#34;&gt;@sql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;help&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Create a data table&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;setup_tables&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sql_setup&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;drop table if exists data&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; create table data (
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;                id integer not null,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;                d datetime not null,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;                m integer not null,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;                primary key (id, d)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;        )&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cmd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ow&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sql_setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cmd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;MySQLdb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;OperationalError&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sa&#34;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;setup_tables: failed &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt; with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cmd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;.&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one year, each day and for each of our 11 (0-10) sensors, 1001 values will be collected.
We insert a random time within the day, and a random measured value, an integer between 0 and 1000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nd&#34;&gt;@sql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;help&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Fill data table with test data&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#daily-buckets-with-group-by&#34;&gt;
	Daily Buckets with GROUP BY
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Window Queries are somewhat related to aggregations with GROUP BY:
With GROUP BY we make look at each row under the lens of the GROUP BY statement.
All rows that have equal values as listed in the GROUP BY clause land on the same pile.
We can then apply aggregation functions to measure the pile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our example, we could use &lt;code&gt;GROUP BY date(d)&lt;/code&gt;.
That is, our &lt;code&gt;datetime&lt;/code&gt; is turned into a &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt;, the time component is cut off.
Two values with the same date, but different times, are considered identical and would land on the same pile.
Different &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; values or different metric values &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; are also not used to select different piles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we do is &lt;code&gt;GROUP BY id, date(d)&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nd&#34;&gt;@sql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;help&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Group by day&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So two measurements from the same sensor-id and taken on the same date are put onto the same pile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MySQL offers us a number of functions to measure the pile: &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/aggregate-functions.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Aggregate Functions&lt;/a&gt;

.
We can &lt;code&gt;COUNT()&lt;/code&gt; the number of rows, we can &lt;code&gt;SUM()&lt;/code&gt; them up, we can ask for their &lt;code&gt;AVG()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MIN()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;MAX()&lt;/code&gt;.
But we can also ask for the values themselves as a comma separated list, using &lt;code&gt;GROUP_CONCAT()&lt;/code&gt;.
We can also ask for the values to be turned into JSON using &lt;code&gt;JSON_ARRAYAGG()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;JSON_OBJECTAGG()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our example above, we ask for the sum and the count and calculate the average ourselves.
The output looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since we aggregate and order by id first, we get all values from sensor 0 first, for an entire year.
Then the values for sensor id 1 follow, starting again at the beginning of the year.
Each row of output has values for one day, because we aggregated that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see how for each of the 10 sensors, approximately 90 values per day exist, but the actual value varies.
We can also see that the average is around 5000, but again, it varies each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;daily-partitions&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#daily-partitions&#34;&gt;
	Daily Partitions
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Window functions work just like aggregates, if we ask for that with a PARTITION BY clause.
But they will return all rows instead of making piles.
So when we define &lt;code&gt;WINDOW w AS ( partition by id, date(d) order by id, d)&lt;/code&gt;, we will get our sensors by sensor and by date.
Each new sensor id, and each new date will restart &amp;ldquo;data collection&amp;rdquo;, that is, our sums or counts will be reset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can check the sums and counts, and see them be restarted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can see how each time the day changes or the id changes the sum and count values start over.
Initially our count is 1, the sum is 6401 and the average is larger than 5000.
As we proceed through the day, we can see how the average converges against that expected value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After &lt;code&gt;2020-01-01 23:27:16&lt;/code&gt; at a count of &lt;code&gt;80&lt;/code&gt; the new day starts and the counters reset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same happens at the end of the year, at &lt;code&gt;2020-01-01 23:27:16&lt;/code&gt; when we start over at the first of January, but with id=1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;moving-average&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#moving-average&#34;&gt;
	Moving average
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of partitioning the data set by date boundaries we can also define a moving window instead.
This window is based on either values, or on date values.
In our case, we want the latter: for each metric date &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt;, we want to do our math on the preceding 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Window clause is &lt;code&gt;WINDOW w AS (order by d range between interval 1 day preceding and current row)&lt;/code&gt;.
As we can see, the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; is out of the picture here:
We cannot nest window definitions, and that means in this example we count and sum over the previous 24h of &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; sensors, not sensors with the same id as ours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the changing &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; values we can see that all sensors are considered.
The count also shows that in the middle of the field around 1000 values are considered - the amount of values in one 24h range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An expression such as &lt;code&gt;order by id, d range between interval 1 day preceding and current row&lt;/code&gt; is not valid: we get&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;and do that for each successive constant &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; value.
That is not fast nor elegant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We would have to wrap all that into a dependent subquery to loop.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Relational, and an Algebra</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/10/29/relational-algebra.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 14:06:51 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/10/29/relational-algebra.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is &amp;ldquo;relational&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;algebra&amp;rdquo; about &amp;ldquo;Relational Algebra&amp;rdquo; and SQL?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is likely that you know all this.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing new in this text, if you had Databases 101 in school or university, so you do not have to read any of this.
In case you had not, or you forgot because it was a long time ago, here it is, again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/vorsicht_mathe.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*This is the english version of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2010/04/28/was-bedeutet-eigentlich-relationale-algebra.html&#34;&gt;much older german writeup&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;algebra&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#algebra&#34;&gt;
	Algebra
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &amp;ldquo;Algebra&amp;rdquo; is a structure that is defined on base set A, with one or more operations on it.
That structure is an algebra, if the result of every operation leads to results that are again in that base set A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you have a thing and math on it, the result is again in that thing, and &lt;em&gt;you can continue to math on it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;natural-numbers-and-addition-and-all-the-pain-that-follows&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#natural-numbers-and-addition-and-all-the-pain-that-follows&#34;&gt;
	Natural numbers and Addition and all the pain that follows
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most well known of these structures is the set of natural numbers and addition {𝐍, +}:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you take two natural, integer, positive numbers and add them, the result is again in that set, a natural, integer and positive number, so you can continue to add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you make it more complicated and take on another operation, subtraction, that is no longer true:
4-6 is -2, which is not in 𝐍, it is integer, but not positive.
We just left the set of natural numbers 𝐍, and now need whole numbers 𝐙 instead to make {𝐙, +, -} an algebra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a whole branch of math, axiomatic number theory, that deals with the ever more complicated things we get in our desire to have an algebra for math with numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start with the empty set and the set that contains the empty set to get 𝐍 in the first place, define addition.
By having a desire for inverse operations, you invent subtraction and need 𝐙.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You invent a shorthand &amp;ldquo;multiplication&amp;rdquo; for repeated addition, and want the inverse, division, and suddenly you need 𝐐, the rational numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you shorthand &amp;ldquo;powers&amp;rdquo; for repeated multiplication, take the inverse,  roots, and have irrational numbers, and finally 𝐑, the set of real numbers as the union of rational and irrational numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All is good, the sun is shining, except one day you take the square root of -1, and end up with 𝐂, the complex numbers, and suddenly you lose total order.
As you descend into this more, you discover Quaternions (and lose commutativity) and other, more complicated structures and lose one nice property after the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But this text is not that story,&lt;/strong&gt; we are doing computer science here, not math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is all kind of weirdness in computer math, too, with machine epsilon and the lack of commutativity, and the number size dependent precision, but again, that is not our story here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We do not even do numbers in our department,&lt;/strong&gt; but more on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we need to talk about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;relations-and-functions&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#relations-and-functions&#34;&gt;
	Relations (and Functions)
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In math, a function is a thing that maps one set onto another set – or the same set, if you have an algebra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is y=0.5x+2, a function that maps 𝐑 on 𝐑, producing a line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing that makes it a function is that for any x, we get exactly one result, exactly one y.
Draw a vertical line from any point on the x-axis, and it will only ever hit the line of the function in exactly one spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2021/10/algebra-function.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are of course also things that for one given x give you more than one y value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example would be y&amp;lt;0.5x+2, all y that are smaller than some value derived from x: That&amp;rsquo;s a relation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2021/10/algebra-relation.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s enough math for one day.&lt;/strong&gt; We still want to do computer science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the first order of the day is to get rid of all these stupid infinities.
Complex, real, rational, yes, even natural numbers - that&amp;rsquo;s a lot of infinite, intangible brain farts from weird math geeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want proper values that are touchable and that can be seen with a debugger in memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer science does discrete math, all finite, all represented in tangible bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That also allows us to define a function (or relation) as a lookup table instead of a formula.
If it returns more than a single value (more than a single table row) it is not a function, as we have learned - it is a relation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thus we end up dealing with tables, and multiple result rows, and the ability to query the query results further - that is &amp;ldquo;relational&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;an algebra&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;relational-algebra-math-with-tables&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#relational-algebra-math-with-tables&#34;&gt;
	Relational Algebra: Math with Tables
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Algebra is a base set, and a number of operations you can perform on the elements of that set, and we demand that the result of any operation again is an element of the base set so that we can math on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our base set is &amp;ldquo;tables&amp;rdquo;.
Tables have rows, and each row has the same number of cells.
Such a row is called &amp;ldquo;a tuple of n values&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;n-tuple&amp;rdquo;, and is usually written with round parens: &lt;code&gt;(3, 4, 5)&lt;/code&gt; for a 3-tuple with the integers 3, 4 and 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In computer science there are two big camps of people:
one wants data types attached to slots, static type persons.
The other wants data types attached to values, dynamic type persons.
Most SQL databases want static types, so you do not define a row as &amp;ldquo;3 columns&amp;rdquo;, but you would say &lt;code&gt;(int, char(20), double)&lt;/code&gt; as an example.
The only SQL product I know of that is different here is SQLite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;operations-on-tables-that-produce-new-tables&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#operations-on-tables-that-produce-new-tables&#34;&gt;
	Operations on tables that produce new tables
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selection - cut out rows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projection -  cut out columns (or make new ones)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join (Cross Product) - combine tables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rename (tables, columns) - so that you can Join a table with itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aggregation - make piles of things considered equal under a projection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;selection-projection&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#selection-projection&#34;&gt;
	Selection, Projection
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2021/10/algebra-ops1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Selection and Projection operations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;SELECTION&lt;/em&gt; operation selects a row from a table. In SQL, this is a &lt;code&gt;WHERE&lt;/code&gt; clause:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;PROJECTION&lt;/em&gt; operation selects a column from a table.
In SQL, it is an expression in the &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can also use projection and rename to make new columns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;seventeen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will make a copy of the original table, and add two more columns, one the concatenation of a and b, and the other a constant number.
We use &lt;code&gt;AS&lt;/code&gt; to rename the columns from a machine selected name to a name of our choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Join operation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;JOIN&lt;/em&gt; operation combines two tables so that each row from table &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is matched with each row of table &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; once for all possible combinations, a cross product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, we wrote this as a comma, and added additional selection clauses to the &lt;code&gt;WHERE&lt;/code&gt; condition to select only the rows we wanted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;aid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;aid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;bid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;aid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;aid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a number of reasons that is unwieldy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It makes it hard to see what is an actual selection, and what is part of the join condition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It creates scoping problems with names&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has no syntax for other join types than a full cross join.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So since 1992 we write the &lt;code&gt;JOIN … ON …&lt;/code&gt; keyword, and can specify different join types by using different keywords (&lt;code&gt;JOIN&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LEFT JOIN&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;RIGHT JOIN&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;OUTER JOIN&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;JOIN&lt;/em&gt; above then becomes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;aid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;aid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;bid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;JOIN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;aid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;aid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;actual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;constraints&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;renaming-tables-for-self-references&#34;&gt;

	Renaming tables for self-references
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2021/10/algebra-ops3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Rename operation used in a self-join context.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a group of problems, list-of-parts problems or self-referential structures, that can only be modeled with a table rename.
The rename operation and the &lt;code&gt;AS&lt;/code&gt; keyword are very old, but SQL that can actually walk such structures is rather new - Recursive Common Table Expressions (&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/with.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Recursive CTEs and the WITH keyword&lt;/a&gt;

).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic self-join looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;emp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;empid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;employee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34; has the boss &amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;boss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;empid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;boss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;emp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;boss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;JOIN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;emp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;emp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;bossid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;boss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;empid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This expression uses the &lt;code&gt;emp&lt;/code&gt; table twice, and in order to be able to decide which instance we are referring to, the &lt;code&gt;AS&lt;/code&gt; keyword is needed to give each instance a unique name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;aggregates&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#aggregates&#34;&gt;
	Aggregates
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fifth and final operation is the aggregation, with the &lt;code&gt;GROUP BY&lt;/code&gt; keyword.
To aggregate, you project a table virtually, and pile all rows that are identical under the projection onto the same heap, then measure heaps with aggregation functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that sounds weird, look at the drawing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2021/10/algebra-ops4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Aggregate operation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;bossid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;emp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;GROUP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;bossid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We group &lt;code&gt;emp&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;bossid&lt;/code&gt;, that is, we put all rows from &lt;code&gt;emp&lt;/code&gt; that have the same value for &lt;code&gt;bossid&lt;/code&gt; onto the same pile.
We can only reference columns that we mention in the &lt;code&gt;GROUP BY&lt;/code&gt;, or measure the piles using aggregation functions such as &lt;code&gt;COUNT()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SUM()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;AVG()&lt;/code&gt; and others, e.g. &lt;code&gt;GROUP_CONCAT()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;emp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;bossid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

	Subqueries: Mathing on with Tables
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we now have a base set, tables, and five table operators that make new tables.
This is supposedly an algebra, so we should be able to apply SQL to the tables made by SQL statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have that - &lt;strong&gt;Subqueries&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	Scalar Subqueries, and new columns
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can &lt;a href=&#34;https://jan.kneschke.de/projects/mysql/groupwise-max/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;put SELECT expressions into any position of the SQL statement&lt;/a&gt;

 in place of constants, column names or expressions.
When we put a &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; into a place of a scalar value, it must return a 1x1 table, of course, to be able to be cast to a scalar (of the appropriate type).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can we make new columns from values that are the result of another select? Yes, we can!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;joining-against-a-subquery&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#joining-against-a-subquery&#34;&gt;
	Joining against a Subquery
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also join against tables that are the results of another select.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start with a query that finds for each schema the number of rows that the largest table in that schema has:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We take the original query and put it into our &lt;code&gt;FROM&lt;/code&gt; clause, naming the resulting table &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;.
We can now join our &lt;code&gt;information_schema.tables&lt;/code&gt; table (which we name &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;) against that original query result &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;, on equal &lt;code&gt;maxrows&lt;/code&gt; values and equal &lt;code&gt;table_schema values&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then ask &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; for the name of all the tables that have as many rows as &lt;code&gt;m.maxrows&lt;/code&gt;.
More than one answer is possible.
For example, the &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt; schema has two tables with 12 rows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dependent-subqueries---the-where-clause&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#dependent-subqueries---the-where-clause&#34;&gt;
	Dependent Subqueries - the WHERE clause
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can solve the same problem also by putting the Subquery into a &lt;code&gt;WHERE&lt;/code&gt; clause:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a dependent subquery:
It runs once for every row in &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; that we find and may or may not produce a value.
We select each row from &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; where the &lt;code&gt;table_schema&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; match and select those rows where the &lt;code&gt;table_rows&lt;/code&gt; match the &lt;code&gt;maxrows&lt;/code&gt; value we find in the subquery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does not sound efficient, and it is in fact the purpose of the program generator of the database to produce an execution plan that is not literally like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, the query planner in MySQL was severely limited, and consequently dependent subquery execution times were very bad.
This is only now, with the 8.0 release, slowly changing.&lt;/p&gt;

	A Tuple is a type, too
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tables are sets of tuples, and a tuple that can be used in SQL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this base table:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#not-an-algebra-ldap-xpath-results-and-many-others&#34;&gt;
	Not an Algebra: LDAP, XPath Results, and many others
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many query languages that are not an algebra, so the results are not of a kind that can be used for further queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most classical example is LDAP:
LDAP defines operations on a tree, the LDAP tree.
The result of any LDAP query is not a subtree, but a node set.
LDAP queries do not work on node sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result:
LDAP servers are very fast, and in some cases can handle hundreds of thousands of queries per second.
But the things that SQL could do in a single query actually need hundreds of thousands of queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another classical example is XPath.
Again, we have a tree as a data type and operations on it.
The result again is a node set, and not a tree, so we cannot query the result using XPath.
This lack is so glaringly obvious that almost all XPath implementations provide extensions to work around that and allow you to somehow convert a node set into a queryable tree.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MySQL: Python and WHERE ... IN ()</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/10/28/python-where-in.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 14:06:51 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/10/28/python-where-in.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a developer using Python, I want to be able to hand
a &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; to an SQL statement with a
&lt;code&gt;WHERE id IN (…)&lt;/code&gt; clause, and it should do the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that is not how it started, because it was asked on the  internal no-work-channel, so it kind of escalated more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-question&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#a-question&#34;&gt;
	A question
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original question was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dev&amp;gt; Why is it 2021, and SQL prepared statements still can&amp;rsquo;t deal with IN?  Or have I missed some exciting development?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a quick detour through Java (which we won&amp;rsquo;t discuss any further in this article), we established that this was a Python problem in this particular instance.
And we touched on several other interesting things on our way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, the solution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ch&#34;&gt;#! /usr/bin/env python3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;MySQLdb&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;MySQLdb.cursors&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nc&#34;&gt;DebugCursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;MySQLdb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cursors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;DictCursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;_query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;bp&#34;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sa&#34;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Debug: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;_query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ow&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you didn&amp;rsquo;t spot it: you can safely generate the &lt;code&gt;WHERE d IN …&lt;/code&gt; clause by supplying a string placeholder and then handing it a &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;.
Do not provide parens, the list will bring its own: It is &lt;code&gt;select d from t where id in %s&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;select d from t where id in ( %s )&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-is-that-safe&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#why-is-that-safe&#34;&gt;
	Why is that safe?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling &lt;code&gt;cursor.execute(sql, args)&lt;/code&gt; to run the SQL.
&lt;code&gt;cursor&lt;/code&gt; is from &lt;code&gt;MySQLdb&lt;/code&gt;, which is the package &lt;code&gt;mysqlclient&lt;/code&gt;, obviously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wait-what&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#wait-what&#34;&gt;
	Wait, what?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Python 2, there was a MySQL database class called &lt;code&gt;MySQLdb&lt;/code&gt; in the package &lt;code&gt;MySQLdb&lt;/code&gt;, which was not Python 3 compatible, and the maintainer vanished.
Also, Python 3 wanted to do away with upper case letters in package names, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So somebody took over the package, renamed it &lt;code&gt;mysqlclient&lt;/code&gt; and made it Python 3 compatible, and kept the old class names in order to, uncharacteristically for Python, not break compatibility.
Hence, you install the dependency &lt;code&gt;mysqlclient&lt;/code&gt; to get the &lt;code&gt;MySQLdb&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember this the next time a Python person makes fun of your PHP needles and haystacks, or your Perl anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;anyway&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#anyway&#34;&gt;
	Anyway…
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, the cursors are in &lt;code&gt;cursors.py&lt;/code&gt;, hopefully somewhere in your venv.
And &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/PyMySQL/mysqlclient/blob/143129be8f57d3a0667f01c989b9776bd80c28d3/MySQLdb/cursors.py#L171-L207&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cursor.execute()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

 looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;171&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;bp&#34;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;199&lt;/span&gt;                 &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;tuple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;literal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;             &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;202&lt;/span&gt;             &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ne&#34;&gt;TypeError&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;203&lt;/span&gt;                 &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ProgrammingError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;204&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;205&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;isinstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;bytes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;bytearray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;206&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;bp&#34;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;_query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;207&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So in line 201, the replacement is a simple old style Python string formatting, &lt;code&gt;query % args&lt;/code&gt;.
This is then handed to &lt;code&gt;self._query()&lt;/code&gt; in line 206.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before that, in 190ff, the args are massaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt; is not a &lt;code&gt;dict&lt;/code&gt;, we &lt;code&gt;map(db.literal, args)&lt;/code&gt;, which happens to be defined in
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/PyMySQL/mysqlclient/blob/5c04abf87d32a3254dd481c03740a8c56520bc3a/MySQLdb/connections.py#L266-L287&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;connections.py:266&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

.
The function escapes the arg using the proper encoding required.
It ends up using
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/PyMySQL/mysqlclient/blob/204fb123683454cdb670e0065f09e50d425b94c8/MySQLdb/_mysql.c#L964-L1011&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;string_literal()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

,
which is defined in &lt;code&gt;_mysql&lt;/code&gt;, a C-language wrapper that links against &lt;code&gt;libmysqlclient.so&lt;/code&gt;, the C language client protocol library.
And that in turn ends up being a call to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/PyMySQL/mysqlclient/blob/204fb123683454cdb670e0065f09e50d425b94c8/MySQLdb/_mysql.c#L1000&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mysql_real_escape_string_quote()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

,
which is the appropriate function for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;code&gt;dicts&lt;/code&gt;, similarly, the items are being enumerated and then &lt;code&gt;db.literal()&lt;/code&gt; is applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is proven to work, and it uses the recommended escape function on parameters for MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;debugging&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#debugging&#34;&gt;
	Debugging
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do hand the query off to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/PyMySQL/mysqlclient/blob/143129be8f57d3a0667f01c989b9776bd80c28d3/MySQLdb/cursors.py#L316-L323&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;self._query()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;


in the end. And that does the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;_query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;bp&#34;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;bp&#34;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;_get_db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;bp&#34;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;_result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;bp&#34;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;_do_get_result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;bp&#34;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;_post_get_result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;bp&#34;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;_executed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;bp&#34;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;rowcount&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That it, it fetches the existing database connection db, sends off the query and fetches and processes the result (so that you can call &lt;code&gt;cursor.fetchall()&lt;/code&gt; or similar on it).
It also remembers the query string in &lt;code&gt;cursor._executed&lt;/code&gt;, but only after the query ran without error.
And finally, it returns the rowcount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could debug by printing &lt;code&gt;cursor._executed&lt;/code&gt;, but only if we don&amp;rsquo;t need to debug and the query actually ran.
That is, because the assignment happens only after the &lt;code&gt;db.query()&lt;/code&gt;, which in turn will throw an exception if there is a problem with our SQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in order to actually debug, we need to do better:
We can specify a &lt;code&gt;cursorclass=&lt;/code&gt; anyway, as a connection parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We make our own cursorclass, &lt;code&gt;DebugCursor&lt;/code&gt;, which we let inherit from our cursor class of choice.
I happen to be partial to &lt;code&gt;DictCursor&lt;/code&gt;, so I inherit from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;code&gt;DebugCursor&lt;/code&gt;, I simply override &lt;code&gt;_query()&lt;/code&gt;, log the query string and hand off things otherwise unchanged to the superclass.
Because I do that before everything else, I get my log sent before stuff catches fire and my code burns to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That way I get to see the replaced SQL before it runs, even it if is gibberish.
So I can actually see that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sql&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;select d from insert_test where d in ( &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;%(ary)s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt; )&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;ary&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;in which I supply my own parens, turns into&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;while without those extra parens I get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; python3 prep.py query

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;{&amp;#39;d&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;zwei&amp;#39;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;{&amp;#39;d&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;drei&amp;#39;}

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;and so I get to actually see that all is fine and well, and properly escaped.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I ranted about hiring interviews, and the canned questions that people have to answer.
One of the interviews we do is a systems design interview, where we want to see how (senior) people use components and patterns to design a system for reliability and scale-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sample question (based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/isotopp/status/1442443978985586691&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;a Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;

 in German):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is 2010, and the company has a database structure where a fixed number front end machines form a cell.
Reads and writes are already split:
Writes go to the primary of a replication tree, and are being replicated to the read instance of the database in each cell.
Reads go to the database instance that is a fixed part of the cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2021/09/mysql-2010-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read and write handles are split in the application. Clients write to a primary MySQL database, which then replicates to a database instance that is fixed part of a cell. Clients from a cell read from this fixed replica.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this is not very effective:
The data center has 10 cells, but when a cell overloads its database, spare capacity from other cells cannot be utilized.
Also, the data center is not redundant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load balance database queries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend the architecture to more than a single data center (or AZ).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optionally be resilient against the loss of individual databases or a full AZ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possible topics or annotations from a candidate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kind of strategies are available for load balancing database connections?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DNS, Anycast or L2 techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proxy (but not a web proxy)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zookeeper or another consensus system with modified clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the advantages or disadvantages of this?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;L2. Huh. Don&amp;rsquo;t do that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DNS updates are slow and complicated. It can be made to work, but you will always have very little control over what is balanced why and how. DNS is better used for a global load balancing of http requests, and not as a database load balancer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zookeeper could be used to do this with modified clients, but we would have to discuss how exactly that works. That&amp;rsquo;s an interesting sub-question of its own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MySQL Router or ProxySQL are made for that, but have a lot of interesting sub-questions of their own. See below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What else may be different when load balancing database connections instead of http?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;web-proxies are not good database proxies. The database protocol is not http, and it is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/07/28/mysql-connection-scoped-state.html&#34;&gt;stateful protocol&lt;/a&gt;

. This requires extra care when load balancing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database connections can be long-lived. A load balancing action to a different client only ever happens on connect. If you disconnect and reconnect only every 100 web actions or so, it is possible for the system to rebalance slowly. On the other hand, if you are using TLS&amp;rsquo;ed connections, connection setup cost can be high, so longer lived connections amortize better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database connections have a highly variable result set size. A single select may return a single value of a single row, or an entire 35 TB table. If the proxy tries to be too intelligent and does things with the result as it passes through, it can die from out of memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proxies can become bottlenecks. Imagine 50 frontends talking to 10 databases via a single proxy on a typical 2010-box with a single (or two) 1 GBit/s network interface, and results contain BLOBs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What else there is to know?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replication scales only reads. As this is a shared nothing architecture, each instance eventually sees all writes. To scale writes, we have to split or shard the database. That is out of scope for this question.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In our specific scenario, the number of writes is not actually a problem. We can assume a few hundred writes per second.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can we extend that to more than one AZ?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, we can create an intermediate primary in each AZ, which takes the writes from the origin AZ into each sub-AZ. It then fans out to the local replicas. This saves on long distance data transfer. It also creates mildly interesting problems for measuring replication delay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because the replication tree is deeper, writes take longer to reach the leaves. Most applications should be able to accommodate that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The alternative would be something with full Two-Phase-Commit, but that would be even slower, and would have scaling limits in the number of systems that participate in the 2PC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is usually how far we get in a single interview session, and only with touching only on some of these points.
To find all is completely unrealistic, even for experienced people.
We would now reach a point where we discuss failure scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it would be highly unusual to get this far, and that is not actually the goal in an interview.
I do in fact hardly care about the solution we end up with.
My goal is to have a useful discussion about databases, scale-out and resiliency, and about stateful systems and their limits.
When there are remarks such as &amp;ldquo;Our environment is smaller, but for us &amp;hellip; works&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;We tried this: &amp;hellip; but observed that often &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; that&amp;rsquo;s actual gold in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even things such as &amp;ldquo;In HTTP one would do &amp;hellip; but I can imagine that with stateful systems that does not work because &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; is already gold, because it shows a level of reflection and insight that is rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective is not to reinvent our 2021 setup. The objective is to use this clearly limited setup as a base for a common conversation about database problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Database Reliability Engineer&amp;rdquo; is the hardest position to hire for in my environment, because it is an &lt;a href=&#34;https://clausraasted.medium.com/t-shaped-consultants-are-great-but-heres-why-you-should-consider-being-h-shaped-instead-72fadf097da9&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;H-shaped qualification&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of H-shaped people is a metaphor used in job recruitment to describe the abilities of individuals in (or outside) the workforce. The vertical bars on the letter H represent the depth of related skills and expertise in a single field or discipline, whereas the horizontal bar is the ability to combine those two disciplines to create value in a way that was hitherto unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective is to find a person that &amp;ldquo;Understands MySQL&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Understands Python or Go&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;Understands any database&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Understands a useful programming language&amp;rdquo;), so that I can throw them at our existing codebase and have them useful within 3-6 months - ugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I can find one person per year, I am very lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MySQL: Binding the ORM</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/09/17/binding-the-orm.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2021 14:06:51 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/09/17/binding-the-orm.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My task is to collect performance data about a single query, using &lt;code&gt;PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA&lt;/code&gt; (P_S for short) in MySQL, to ship it elsewhere for integration with other data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a grander scheme of things, I will need to define what performance data from a query I am actually interested in.
I will also need to find a way to attribute the query (as seen on the server) to a point in the codebase of the client, which is not always easy when an ORM or other SQL generator is being used.
And finally I will need to find a way to view the query execution in the context of the client code execution, because the data access is only a part of the system performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is about marking a query so that it can be identified in source and attributed to its origin in the codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my scenario, I have control over the ORM or DAO.
I can look at the stackframe, identify the caller of the &lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt; function and put filename and line number or other identifying information into the generated query text.
I could also get identifiers (&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/opentracing/specification/blob/master/specification.md&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;tracing ids&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;quot;) from the caller and pass them on, so the query execution can be a child span of the ORM call that made the SQL and ran it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;comments-are-stripped-from-p_s&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#comments-are-stripped-from-p_s&#34;&gt;
	Comments are stripped from P_S
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s try comments first.
The &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/comments.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;manual knows&lt;/a&gt;

 three kinds of comments in MySQL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/* ... */&lt;/code&gt; C-like comments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;# ...&lt;/code&gt; Shell-like comments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-- ...&lt;/code&gt; Not quite SQL-like comments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With preserved comments I could put identifying information into the query string, and later extract it from P_S.
I could use this information to attribute the query and link it to its origin in code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one connection, I issue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;localhost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;8025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;msandbox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;kris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt;/* keks */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;8192&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;rows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result set is irrelevant, but I put a comment with &lt;code&gt;/* ... */&lt;/code&gt; into the query string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In P_S, I find&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;localhost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;8025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;msandbox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;performance_schema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sql_text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;events_statements_history&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;thread_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;47&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;order&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;event_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;desc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;limit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comment has been stripped, you can still see the double spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old-fashioned SQL comments and shell comments seem to die already in the client:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same happens with Shell comments: Of course, again, the comment is not in P_S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unclear why comments are stripped, and where.
Maybe it is a vestige from the statement conditioning that was installed as a pre-stage to the late query cache, bless its rotten soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seem to be two mechanisms, one for SQL and Shell comments, and one for C comments:
When looking at the client history, the Shell and SQL  comments are not recalled by the editor, but the C comment is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This difference in treatment makes some sense, because MySQL uses magic C comments to control statement parsing for compatibility: &lt;code&gt;SELECT /*! 80000 NEW_KEYWORD */&lt;/code&gt; is parsed as a &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; by MySQL before version 8.0.0 and as &lt;code&gt;SELECT NEW_KEYWORD&lt;/code&gt; by MySQL 8.0.0 and higher. This allows &lt;code&gt;mysqldump&lt;/code&gt; and other programs to emit SQL code that degrades gracefully on older versions of MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar syntax, &lt;code&gt;/*+ ...*/&lt;/code&gt; is used to control optimizer hints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;new-query-attributes&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#new-query-attributes&#34;&gt;
	New: Query attributes
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Query Attributes are a newfangled thing (8.0.23 or newer) that allow a client to annotate a query.
The annotations are preserved in the server and are being made available in some contexts, but they do nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/query-attributes.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The manual&lt;/a&gt;

 explains this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attributes are defined prior to sending a statement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They exist until the statement ends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While they exist, they can be accessed on the server side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The examples given are exactly my use-case:
Transporting identifying information from the client into the server, or injecting control information for a plugin from the client into the server in order to affect query processing in the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Query Attributes do nothing in the server.
The server does not look at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Query Attributes are supported by the C-API client and the MySQL command line client.
Not much support exists elsewhere, yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic exercise to check functions works:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#where-to-go-from-here&#34;&gt;
	Where to go from here?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can generate a query in a client I control, and annotate the query with identifying information.
In my case this information will be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A trace flag. If the query is to be traced, the trace flag will be present. The default is: The query will not be traced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A set of three identifiers (alphanumeric strings: sha256 MACs, UUIDs or strings representing integer numbers). They are a root id, a parent id and a query id. These identifiers allow me to model a span/parent span relationship in a larger tracing context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to find a hook in the server for a plugin.
The plugin must run after query execution, but with the execution plan, the query string and the P_S data for the query still present.
I am not yet familiar with this, and need to check the current server about what is on offer.
Maybe the hook that the audit plugin uses can be repurposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the trace flag is set, it will need to access&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the query attributes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the query plan that ran, if possible (Need to check what &lt;code&gt;EXPLAIN FOR CONNECTION&lt;/code&gt; does)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the information about the query execution that can be gathered from P_S data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It needs to transform this information into a single serialized form, for example a JSON string, and then exfiltrate this in a way that does not block the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The generic way to do this in my environment has in the past been to send a UDP packet to localhost.
UDP to localhost is considered non-lossy, limited to 64K and dropping the data if the listener is not present.
A file write to an append-only file may also write, if there is a rotation/truncation mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will then need to take the JSON in my client, transform it some more and send it to a tracing consumer, e.g. Jaeger, Lightstep, or in my case, Honeycomb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trace data will there be joined with spans from other components, including spans around the ORM that made the SQL and the code that called into the ORM.
This will allow to view the context of the query without having to grep for it, use modern web tools to analyze query execution in the context that generated it and generally unify SQL debugging with other application debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes the need for specialized &amp;ldquo;Database Performance Monitoring&amp;rdquo; (DPM) software go away, at least for individual developers.
A DPM can still be useful for operational tasks, but these are usually served by telegrams MySQL collector, Prometheus and Grafana just fine (and these usually scale better than a DPM).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MySQL: Tracing a single query with PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/09/15/mysql-tracing-a-single-query-with-performanceschema.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 18:06:51 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/09/15/mysql-tracing-a-single-query-with-performanceschema.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My task is to collect performance data about a single query, using &lt;code&gt;PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA&lt;/code&gt; (P_S for short) in MySQL, to ship it elsewhere for integration with other data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a grander scheme of things, I will need to define what performance data from a query I am actually interested in.
I will also need to find a way to attribute the query (as seen on the server) to a point in the codebase of the client, which is not always easy when an ORM or other SQL generator is being used.
And finally I will need to find a way to view the query execution in the context of the client code execution, because the data access is only a part of the system performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is about query execution in the server, and the instrumentation available to me in MySQL 8, at least to get things started.
So we take the tour of performance schema, and then run one example query (a simple join) and see what we can find out about this query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;performance-schema-the-10000m-view&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#performance-schema-the-10000m-view&#34;&gt;
	Performance Schema, the 10.000 m view
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Manual&lt;/a&gt;

 has a major chapter that covers P_S in details.
The original idea of P_S is to have a bunch of preallocated memory areas without locks, presented to the database itself as tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P_S is unusual in the way that P_S &amp;ldquo;tables&amp;rdquo; are never locked while you work with them.
That means the values in a &amp;ldquo;table&amp;rdquo; can change while you read them.
That is important - if you for example calculate percentages, they may not add up to 100%.
If you &lt;code&gt;ORDER BY&lt;/code&gt;, the sort may or may not be stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are good properties: P_S will not freeze the server, and you won&amp;rsquo;t kill the server by working with P_S tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a good idea to make a copy of P_S tables while you work with them, by turning off subquery merging with &lt;code&gt;select /*+ NO_MERGE(t) */ &lt;/code&gt;, and then materializing P_S tables in subqueries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, P_S also had no secondary indexes, so joining P_S tables against other P_S tables did not work efficiently.
That was probably a good idea, because joining against a table that is changing while you execute the join is probably generating random results anyway.
But because it is so common, and because MySQL itself does this now internally in &lt;code&gt;sys.*&lt;/code&gt;, secondary indexes to join efficiently now exist.
That does not make the joins more correct, but at least you get the result faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote about all this &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/12/01/not-joining-on-performance-schema.html&#34;&gt;in an earlier article&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;instruments-objects-actors-threads-and-consumers&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#instruments-objects-actors-threads-and-consumers&#34;&gt;
	Instruments, Objects, Actors, Threads and Consumers
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data P_S collects is centered around three major things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time consumed. In database servers, that is mostly wait time - waiting on I/O or locks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data transferred. In database servers, that is mostly pages read or written. In a way, this related to I/O wait.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory used. In database servers, that is buffers allocated - how large, and how often, and peak usage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P_S collects this in the form of &amp;ldquo;events&amp;rdquo; (and takes care to note that P_S events are not binlog events or other any events).
The collection points are in the database server code, which is instrumented, so the collectors are &lt;em&gt;instruments&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing that the server code works on may be of a certain kind, for example a table or another &lt;em&gt;object&lt;/em&gt; in the server, but have a variable identity (that would be different tables, with different names).
Instruments can be filtered by using object names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activity done in the server is done on behalf of a database user, in the form of &lt;em&gt;user@host&lt;/em&gt; or, new in MySQL 8, using roles.
The entity on which behalf the server is working on is called the &lt;em&gt;actor&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activity done in the server is also done in the context of a &lt;em&gt;thread&lt;/em&gt;, some of which are background threads, while the majority in a busy server are usually connection threads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, the data collected is put into the in-memory tables of P_S.
These come in various groups, and are called &lt;em&gt;consumers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2021/09/performance_schema_filtering.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data is collected from objects using instruments. Instruments can be turned on and off. Their collected data is then filtered by Objects, Actors and Threads, and finally dropped into consumers. Many consumers are aggregates, some collect information specific to one query execution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each of these things there is a &lt;code&gt;setup_...&lt;/code&gt; table that controls how event data is collected by the instrumentation, filtered and the consumed in result tables.
In parallel, object identities are collected in &lt;code&gt;..._instances&lt;/code&gt; tables, which are needed to resolve object identities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#current-history-and-history-long-tables-vs-summaries&#34;&gt;
	Current, History and History Long Tables vs. Summaries
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P_S collects data in a lot of summary table, which should not interest us that much here.
Our task is to look at the performance data of a single, individual query to better understand what happened when it ran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These unaggregated tables are &lt;code&gt;events_transactions&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;events_statements&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;events_stages&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;events_waits&lt;/code&gt;.
For each of them, we have  &lt;code&gt;_current&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;_history&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;_history_long&lt;/code&gt; tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;_current&lt;/code&gt; tables contain one entry for the currently running thread.
The &lt;code&gt;_history&lt;/code&gt; tables contain a configurable number of entries for each thread, for example 10 per thread.
And the &lt;code&gt;_history_long&lt;/code&gt; tables contain a configurable number of entries, shared across all threads, for example 10.000 in total.
As the server continues to execute statements and produce events, old entries are discarded and new entries are added, automatically.
Additionally, each query execution is aggregated along several dimensions in summary tables.
Summary tables state these dimension(s) using &lt;code&gt;by_&amp;lt;dimensionname&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, for example &lt;code&gt;_by_user_by_eventname&lt;/code&gt; or similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In current MySQL, P_S is enabled by default.
But not all instruments and consumers are enabled, because some instrumentation slows query execution down, and some consumers can use a lot of memory.
To be fast and safe, all memory is statically allocated at config change so the memory resource usage of P_S is constant and no allocations are made during execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can enable all instrumentation completely with this SQL:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is, events are tagged with a &lt;code&gt;THREAD_ID&lt;/code&gt; (which is not a CONNECTION_ID() as seen in processlist), an &lt;code&gt;EVENT_ID/END_EVENT_ID&lt;/code&gt; bracket, various source and timer values and for further dissection, a &lt;code&gt;NESTING_EVENT_ID&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_TYPE&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can translate processlist ids into thread ids using the &lt;code&gt;P_S.THREADS&lt;/code&gt; table, and then use this to limit our view on the &lt;code&gt;events_statements_current&lt;/code&gt; table:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So running this query took 341 Microseconds, or 0.341 ms.
And sources are named after their location in the server sourcecode, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/blob/8.0/sql/conn_handler/init_net_server_extension.cc#L94-L96&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;filename and line number&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Events exist in a hierarchy: wait events nest within stage events, which nest within statement events, which nest within transaction events.
Some nested events refer to their own type, for example, statement events can point to other statement events they are nested in.
Other events refer to their enclosing context in the hierarchy.
Nesting Event ID, Type and Level make this clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;instrument-names&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#instrument-names&#34;&gt;
	Instrument names
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manual explains &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema-instrument-naming.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Instrument Names&lt;/a&gt;

.
They have path-like names that group instruments hierarchically, for example &lt;code&gt;wait/io/file/innodb/innodb_data_file&lt;/code&gt;.
This is a &lt;code&gt;wait&lt;/code&gt; event, &lt;code&gt;io&lt;/code&gt; related, specifically &lt;code&gt;file&lt;/code&gt; I/O, more specific &lt;code&gt;innodb&lt;/code&gt; and even more specific &lt;code&gt;innodb_data_file&lt;/code&gt;.
Looking at other fields in the &lt;code&gt;events_waits_history&lt;/code&gt; table, we would see the file name as part of the &lt;code&gt;OBJECT_SCHEMA.OBJECT_NAME&lt;/code&gt; designator for this event.
That means, we can see how long we waited for I/O coming from this specific file or going to the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further up in the nesting we would see, at the statement level, the actual &lt;code&gt;SQL_TEXT&lt;/code&gt;, and also the number of rows scanned.
That means we can get a rough estimate why this particular statement instance was slow - for example, the plan was good, the number of rows was low, but we see a lot of actual file IO waits, so probably the buffer pool was cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manual page above discusses the instrument names at length, and it is important to get an overview of what exists and what is measured.
Specifically, for statement level entries the instruments vary during query execution and become more detailed, as they reflect the progress in understanding of the server about the nature of the statement as it is executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;an-example-run&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#an-example-run&#34;&gt;
	An example run
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a freshly restarted idle server, we log in to a shell and &lt;code&gt;use world&lt;/code&gt; for the world sample database.
This is a tiny database, but because the server has been just restarted, nothing of it is cached.
We run a simple query:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;localhost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;8025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;msandbox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mysql command line client is running from the sandbox with &lt;code&gt;/home/kris/opt/mysql/8.0.25/bin/mysql --defaults-file=/home/kris/sandboxes/msb_8_0_25/my.sandbox.cnf world&lt;/code&gt;.
Autocompletion for names is not disabled.
So on client startup, the client invisibly runs &lt;code&gt;show databases&lt;/code&gt; to learn the names of all databases for autocompletion.
It then enters the &lt;code&gt;world&lt;/code&gt; database as requested and runs &lt;code&gt;show tables&lt;/code&gt; to learn the names of all tables in the &lt;code&gt;world&lt;/code&gt; database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only then we come to the prompt and can paste our query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are only interested in &lt;code&gt;thread_id = 48 AND event_id = 5574&lt;/code&gt;, our query.&lt;/p&gt;

It took 3310477000 picoseconds (3.31ms) to run.
The &lt;code&gt;sql_text&lt;/code&gt; is the full text of the statement (up to a cutoff point, in order to manage memory consumption).
The parsed statement is called &lt;code&gt;digest_text&lt;/code&gt; - identifiers are quoted, whitespace is normalized, actual constants are replaced with placeholders, and (not shown here) variable length &lt;code&gt;WHERE ... IN (...)&lt;/code&gt; clauses are shortened with ellipses.
This normalized digest is then hashed and produces an identifier for this group of identically formed statements, the &lt;code&gt;digest&lt;/code&gt;.
We learn about the number of rows looked at, &lt;code&gt;92&lt;/code&gt; and sent, &lt;code&gt;46&lt;/code&gt;.
No special flags indicating specific execution modes were set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use the &lt;code&gt;event_id&lt;/code&gt; to look even deeper:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the various execution stages of our statement - we select by &lt;code&gt;thread_id&lt;/code&gt; and with the &lt;code&gt;event_id&lt;/code&gt; of the statement, &lt;code&gt;5574&lt;/code&gt; as a &lt;code&gt;nesting_id&lt;/code&gt;, ordered by &lt;code&gt;event_id&lt;/code&gt;.
Time was consumed by the &lt;code&gt;stage/sql/statistics&lt;/code&gt; phase, looking up table stats for a good execution plan, and then by the actual query execution in &lt;code&gt;stage/sql/executing&lt;/code&gt;.
The former took 0.7ms (703.58us), the latter 2.26ms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are interested in what took so long, specifically, so we look into waits for event_ids 5611 and 5712 - finding nothing, and also nothing particularly time-consuming:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We seem to be unable to attribute time spent loading data from disk to a specific thread, and we seem to be unable to account for the runtime of certain stages by looking at waits.
That&amp;rsquo;s unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;memory-only-as-summary&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#memory-only-as-summary&#34;&gt;
	Memory only as summary
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diverse &lt;code&gt;memory_%&lt;/code&gt; tables exist to track memory usage in the server.
All of these tables are summary tables, there are no memory events tables that could trace memory usage per query.
That might be okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;-----------+-------------------------------+-------------+---------------------------+---------------------------+
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;rows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;no-explain&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#no-explain&#34;&gt;
	No EXPLAIN
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that would be useful to collect from P_S is the actual execution plan of a query.
But while we can explain a lot of statements by running &lt;code&gt;EXPLAIN &amp;lt;stmt&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and while we can &lt;code&gt;EXPLAIN FOR CONNECT ...&lt;/code&gt;, the former is not the recorded execution plan, and the latter only works while the query is running.
It&amp;rsquo;s the actual execution plan while the query executes, but it is not recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#summary&#34;&gt;
	Summary
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of information about query execution can be gathered from P_S.
The query execution can be broken down in statements, stages and waits.
Specifically, statements collect a lot of interesting quality flags.
Stages can collect percentages of completion for long-running queries and give a general feel about where in the query execution time is spent.
Waits should be able to attribute time to individual operations in the database server, but specifically for file I/O this seems to be more complicated, and I have not been able to solve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see waits for I/O summary tables, and we can see a lot of other statistical information in other summary tables.
We can also use additional tables not covered here for debugging (for example &lt;code&gt;DATA_LOCKS&lt;/code&gt; for locking behavior).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory instrumentation is interesting, but at this stage it is unclear to me if it is sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to be really hard to record execution plans together with statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More experimentation with more complicated queries is necessary to see if it is possible to see things like sorting, temp files and similar operations, and attribute time to these operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of queries on P_S necessary to extract information about a single query is staggering, a 10:1 ratio.
At least filters exist and are on by default, so that I do not have to hear my monitoring noise in my monitoring.
That is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could really use a single large JSON blob containing the entire package with performance data for a query, at once - one query to trace one query.
That is, the information from transaction, statement, stages, waits, the execution plan and the memory consumption for a given transaction or statement, in one go.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MySQL: Page compression revisited</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/09/14/mysql-page-compression-revisited.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2021 16:03:47 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/09/14/mysql-page-compression-revisited.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like I said, I never had much reason to use table compression, and only recently looked into the topic.
MySQL Page Compression looks a lot easier at the database end of things, but relies on hole punching support in the file system.
Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at what that means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;files-inodes-and-arrays-of-blocks&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#files-inodes-and-arrays-of-blocks&#34;&gt;
	Files, Inodes and Arrays of Blocks
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original Unix filesystem saw the disk as a sea of blocks, which were represented in a free map as an array of bits.
Files have numbers, which are an index into an array of so-called inode structures.
Inodes store the files metadata and contain an array of block numbers, which make up the actual file.
The array is folded multiple times, to optimize for the more common case of small files:
The first few block numbers were stored in the inode, followed by a pointer to a block containing file block numbers, then a pointer to a block containing pointers to blocks of file block numbers and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2021/09/filestructure.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The block list inside an array is folded multiple times, to optimize for the more common case of small files.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These structures make up the so-called lower filesystem, which deals with organizing blocks into numbered files efficiently.
On top of that resides the upper filesystem, which is concerned with managing names of files, and organizing them into directories.
In our instance the upper filesystem is of no interest, so we are ignoring it completely:
To us files are sequences of blocks, organized in inodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the folded block array of the original file system served us for many decades, more modern file systems try to shrink these block lists by storing extents.
An extent is a pair (start, length) that describes a  contiguous sequence of blocks.
On a mostly empty disk, most files can probably be arranged in such runs of contiguous blocks, so this is a more efficient way to store things.
Also, free lists can in many cases be stored more efficiently as extents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The XFS filesystem is getting a lot of mileage of such extents, and one major a difference between the Linux ext3 and ext4 is the use of extents instead of block lists and bitmaps in many places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;sparse-files&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#sparse-files&#34;&gt;
	Sparse Files
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unix always allowed you to seek past the end of a file and write data.
The following example program creates a file named &lt;code&gt;testfile&lt;/code&gt; by opening a new file of length 0, seeking to the position 20 GB and writing an integer at that position.
The resulting file is 20 GB in length, but only occupies a minuscule amount of disk space.
This is called a &lt;em&gt;sparse file&lt;/em&gt;, a file with holes in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading a sparse file, the non-existent blocks are returned as blocks filled with zeroes.
On writing, space is allocated for the previously unallocated blocks in the sparse file, but probably not in sequence.
So on hard disks, a seek occurs that would probably not have occurred, had the file actually been written properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34; data-lang=&#34;c&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;kris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nl&#34;&gt;server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;~&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sparseme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When looking at this on the disk we can see that in fact only 4 KB of disk space (one block on a modern disk) has been allocated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We compile the C-program with &lt;code&gt;cc -o sparseme sparseme.c&lt;/code&gt;, then run it as &lt;code&gt;./sparseme&lt;/code&gt;.
We look at the resulting &lt;code&gt;testfile&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;ls -lsh testfile&lt;/code&gt;. The size of the file is shown as 21G, but the allocation (in the leftmost column, we asked for that with the &lt;code&gt;-s&lt;/code&gt; flag) is only 4K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the XFS maintenance program &lt;code&gt;xfs_bmap&lt;/code&gt; in verbose mode, we get to see the block map (bmap) of the file, as an extent listing. The program operates with sectors of 512 bytes, the unit that was common for many hard disk before we moved to 4K sectors. We see a large hole from offset 0 to 41943039 (times 512 bytes for sector size, this is 20 GB). Then there are 8 sectors (one 4K disk drive hardware block) mapped to 8 contiguous blocks (actually one hardware block) at 104705904 from the start of the partition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can do the same thing using a &lt;code&gt;dd&lt;/code&gt; command without writing a C-program:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;kris@server:~$ rm testfile testfile2

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;   1: [41943040..41943047]: 104705904..104705911  3 (10334064..10334071)        8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;code&gt;of=testfile2&lt;/code&gt; generates the outfile, and we write one byte (&lt;code&gt;bs=1&lt;/code&gt;) one time (&lt;code&gt;count=1&lt;/code&gt;) after seeking to position 20G (&lt;code&gt;seek=...&lt;/code&gt;).
Using &lt;code&gt;ls -lsh&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;xfs_bmap&lt;/code&gt; output, we can confirm that this is indeed a file with a hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sparse files are hard to handle:
When you copy them, the non-existent blocks are read as blocks full of 0-bytes, and written.
The target file will therefore actually allocate all the space the source file only claims to be large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a problem with &lt;code&gt;core&lt;/code&gt; files in many Unix system, because they are being dumped as sparse files, mapping the actual process address space to file offsets, and leaving unallocated space in the address space at least in part as holes in the file.
Until you naively copy that file, that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GNU &lt;code&gt;cp&lt;/code&gt; program has a &lt;code&gt;--sparse&lt;/code&gt; option that tries to handle this, and &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; also has special options that make it sparse file aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;hole-punching&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#hole-punching&#34;&gt;
	Hole Punching
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some filesystems allow you to punch holes into files, using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://lwn.net/Articles/415889/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;fallocate(2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

 system call.
This system call can be used to assign blocks to a file, making sure it is not a sparse file, without actually having to write all those bytes and a few other things.
Using the filesystem dependent &lt;code&gt;FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE&lt;/code&gt; flag, extents in the file can be marked as &amp;lsquo;unused&amp;rsquo; and be given back to the filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look what our tables from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/09/09/mysql-two-kinds-of-compression.html&#34;&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt;

 look like on disk, using &lt;code&gt;xfs_bmap&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The uncompressed table looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;kris@server:~/sandboxes/msb_8_0_25/data/kris$ xfs_bmap -v keks.ibd

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;   1: [64..159]:        104753560..104753655  3 (10381720..10381815)     96
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;   2: [160..223]:       104744928..104744991  3 (10373088..10373151)     64
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;  ...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;  18: [327680..450559]: 126091200..126214079  4 (262080..384959)     122880
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;  19: [450560..516095]: 126404568..126470103  4 (575448..640983)      65536
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We get 20 extents, some of which are smaller than 100 sectors, but some of which are larger than 100k sectors of contiguous space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the page compressed file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;kris@server:~/sandboxes/msb_8_0_25/data/kris$ xfs_bmap -v keks2.ibd

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We get more than 30k extents here, all of them 8 sectors (4K) of data and 24 sectors (12K) of hole in my very compressible test data.
This is messy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to delete these things demonstrates the cost of this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With longer files, we get more holes, more overhead and even longer times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;file-size-over-time&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#file-size-over-time&#34;&gt;
	File Size over Time
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While running &lt;code&gt;insert into keks2 select * from keks&lt;/code&gt;, I was monitoring the size of the new table at the file system level.
This looks funny, because we can see the file&amp;rsquo;s allocation growing over time, but there are downward spikes in allocation every few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The size of these downward spikes (several megabytes in some instances) is impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

	Implications for MySQL
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Page Compression was introduced to MySQL in 2015, and Mark Callaghan has been experimenting from early on.
He has a series of blog articles on this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://smalldatum.blogspot.com/2015/10/wanted-file-system-on-which-innodb.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Wanted Wanted: a file system on which InnoDB transparent page compression works&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and earlier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://smalldatum.blogspot.com/2015/08/first-day-with-innodb-transparent-page.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;First day with InnoDB transparent page compression&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://smalldatum.blogspot.com/2015/09/second-day-with-innodb-transparent-page.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Second day with InnoDB transparent page compression&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://smalldatum.blogspot.com/2015/09/third-day-with-innodb-transparent-page.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Third day with InnoDB transparent page compression&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and being Mark, he also has a series of bugs open on this.
The links are in the articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Wanted&amp;rdquo; article from the list above contains a number of very recent, very relevant comments by Marko Mäkelä, and a link to &lt;a href=&#34;https://lwn.net/Articles/864363&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;LWN: Hole-punching races against page-cache filling&lt;/a&gt;

, from July 29, 2021.
This bug is still open in all production Linux kernels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to make using Page Compression a risky and expensive thing. Mark&amp;rsquo;s estimate in private communication was approximately &amp;ldquo;a thing such as RocksDB which never overwrites data has an inherent advantage  over anything that does in-place updates when it comes to compression&amp;rdquo; (my summary of his words), and I think he&amp;rsquo;s correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems I accidentally did a few things right when I never even tried to use compressed tables in InnoDB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;thanks&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#thanks&#34;&gt;
	Thanks
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks, Mark, for you very useful and insightful comments, and for nudging me to go deeper on this.
And thanks for necro&amp;rsquo;ing Marks articles with your comments, Marko!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MySQL: CREATE IF NOT EXISTS TABLE, but CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/09/10/create-if-not-exists.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 20:01:06 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/09/10/create-if-not-exists.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the MySQL Million Challenge, I was going through the server syntax in order to understand what things can be created in the server.
And now my OCD triggered.
DDL is a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;creation&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#creation&#34;&gt;
	Creation
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a database developer, I want to be able to create server objects using the &lt;code&gt;CREATE thing&lt;/code&gt; syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The server gives you that for the following things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DATABASE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EVENT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FUNCTION (and FUNCTION SONAME)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;INDEX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LOGFILE GROUP (NDB only, not going to look at this)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PROCEDURE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RESOURCE GROUP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ROLE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SERVER&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SPATIAL REFERENCE SYSTEM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TABLE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TABLESPACE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TRIGGER&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USER&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VIEW&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;safe-creation&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#safe-creation&#34;&gt;
	Safe creation
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a database developer I want to be able to script things safely, so I need &lt;code&gt;IF NOT EXISTS&lt;/code&gt; clauses in my &lt;code&gt;CREATE&lt;/code&gt; syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statements that create things often allow you to specify &lt;code&gt;IF NOT EXISTS&lt;/code&gt; for conditional creation of the thing:
Creation of the thing will fail if it already exists.
Using the &lt;code&gt;IF NOT EXISTS&lt;/code&gt; clause the creation is conditional, so if the thing already exists this is not an error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is important for scripting: If the thing already exists, the script will throw an error and depending on settings will stop.
It is even more important in replication, because if you replicate the creation statement to a replica, the replication will stop with an error unless it is conditional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;code&gt;CREATE&lt;/code&gt; statements replicate, but do not offer conditional syntax.
They cannot be used safely in replication, and they are cumbersome in scripting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two &lt;code&gt;CREATE&lt;/code&gt; statements offer deviant safe creation: Instead of &lt;code&gt;CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS&lt;/code&gt; they offer &lt;code&gt;CREATE OR REPLACE ...&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;multiple-object-syntax&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#multiple-object-syntax&#34;&gt;
	Multiple object syntax
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a database developer I want to be able to chain multiple &lt;code&gt;CREATE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;DROP&lt;/code&gt; actions together in a single statement, so that the things are created (or dropped) together, atomically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, DDL could be made transactional.
This makes sense even if a rollback is not possible, if they are being executed in a kind of DDL transaction under a lock, so that they appear to happen atomically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple &lt;code&gt;CREATE&lt;/code&gt; syntax does not exist.
For few objects, a multiple drop syntax does exist, but support is thin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;safe-drop&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#safe-drop&#34;&gt;
	Safe DROP
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a database developer, I want to be able to &lt;code&gt;DROP&lt;/code&gt; the things that I created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a database developer, I want to be able to make the &lt;code&gt;DROP&lt;/code&gt; conditional using an &lt;code&gt;IF EXISTS&lt;/code&gt; clause, to be able to script and replicate this operation safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The support for this is better than for creation, for some reason, and there is no deviant syntax.
Still, some things cannot be dropped safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;enumeration-and-definition-display&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#enumeration-and-definition-display&#34;&gt;
	Enumeration and Definition display
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a developer, I want to be able to enumerate all the things of a category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logically, an API is incomplete without enumeration.
I need to be able to see what exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In MySQL, a lot of things can be listed with &lt;code&gt;SHOW&lt;/code&gt; commands, and all things can be listed by looking into the appropriate system tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, a lot of things can not be listed using the &lt;code&gt;SHOW plural&lt;/code&gt; syntax (&lt;code&gt;SHOW TABLES&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SHOW DATABASES&lt;/code&gt;).
For a few things, a deviant syntax is supported (&lt;code&gt;SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS&lt;/code&gt;) that also shows the definition of the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For other things you have to access system tables.
These system tables seem to be spread around, some are in I_S (Tablespace), others in mysql.* (servers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, MySQL seems to favor the syntax &lt;code&gt;SHOW CREATE thing&lt;/code&gt; to show an SQL statement that would recreate the thing if I dropped it.
But for some things, this is not implemented, despite the fact that the information for this is available in various system tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;altering-and-renaming-things&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#altering-and-renaming-things&#34;&gt;
	Altering and renaming things
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a database developer, I want to be able to change the definition of a thing after creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most things can be altered after creation.
For some things, some attributes cannot be altered even if an &lt;code&gt;ALTER&lt;/code&gt; statement exists. Notably, it is impossible to rename a database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only two things can be renamed, tables and users.
For other things, renaming is possible using &lt;code&gt;ALTER TABLE RENAME&lt;/code&gt; syntax, but a pure &lt;code&gt;RENAME&lt;/code&gt; does not exist despite the fact that renaming is supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For roles and users, &lt;code&gt;ALTER thing IF EXISTS&lt;/code&gt; conditional syntax is supported, but for all other things it is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;replication&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#replication&#34;&gt;
	Replication
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All thing creations are replicated, except resource groups and servers.
That even makes sense, which is unusual, given all the other illogical anomalies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-table-because-this-is-about-databases&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#a-table-because-this-is-about-databases&#34;&gt;
	A table, because this is about databases
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Command&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;replicates&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;enumerate SHOW&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;CREATE&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;IF   T EXISTS&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;OR REPLACE&lt;/th&gt;

      <title>MySQL: The Million Challenge</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/09/10/mysql-million-challenge.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 16:01:06 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/09/10/mysql-million-challenge.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A long-standing idea that I have is to test the servers limits:
How does it fail and break if there are very many of a thing?
Previously that was too easy, because many structures were constructed in a way that it was obvious they would not scale.
But with MySQL 8 many things were overhauled, so let&amp;rsquo;s see what we can make many of and see how the server fares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-million-challenge&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-million-challenge&#34;&gt;
	The Million Challenge
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Database servers are programs that are built to handle a lot of data. A million rows in a table are not a problem, and searching one in a million rows neither, because the server has structures that make this fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is the database server using these structures internally in an efficient way and can it handle a lot of tables, schemas, views, users, grants, roles and so on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can we try?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a million tables and see how performance degrades or not.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will this work better if we use general tablespaces instead of file-per-table?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a million views, all pointing to the same table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nest views, one million deep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a million stored procedures.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a million stored procedures, calling each other in a chain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a many triggers? Is that even possible?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a million users.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a million grants. This one is dear to my heart - we have this at work in one environment, and it broke the server in an exciting and hard to fix way. &lt;code&gt;GRANT&lt;/code&gt; statements in the processlist and &lt;code&gt;SHOW PROCESSLIST&lt;/code&gt; running concurrently raced badly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a million concurrent connections. Well, no, but I have seen 60.000 already, and it was not pretty. This failed in interesting ways, because monitoring was joining against &lt;code&gt;P_S.THREADS&lt;/code&gt; and fell over badly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a million users, using roles.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a million roles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any other ideas that fit the general theme?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MySQL: The table &#39;../tmp/#sql…&#39; is full</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/09/09/tmp-file-full.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 17:01:06 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/09/09/tmp-file-full.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We observe a large number of messages of the kind&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;The table &amp;#39;../tmp/#sql…&amp;#39; is full
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;before-mysql-8&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#before-mysql-8&#34;&gt;
	Before MySQL 8
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In older Versions of MySQL, implied temporary tables are being created whenever your &lt;code&gt;EXPLAIN&lt;/code&gt; contained the phrase &lt;code&gt;using temporary&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, MySQL would create an in-memory temporary table to materialize an intermediate query result, and then continue to process the data from there. If that temporary table was larger than some configurable limit, the temporary table would instead be converted to a MyISAM table on disk, streamed out, and then work would continue with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has a large number of disadvantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A table in the &lt;code&gt;MEMORY&lt;/code&gt; storage engine can have no variable length columns. That means, any &lt;code&gt;VARCHAR&lt;/code&gt; column gets converted to a &lt;code&gt;CHAR&lt;/code&gt; column in the &lt;code&gt;MEMORY&lt;/code&gt; version of that table.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt; Your 5 byte (plus overhead) long &amp;lsquo;&lt;code&gt;hello&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rsquo; in a &lt;code&gt;VARCHAR(255) CHARSET utf8&lt;/code&gt; would turn into a 765 byte &lt;code&gt;CHAR(255) CHARSET utf8&lt;/code&gt; monstrosity, right-padded with spaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory used by &lt;code&gt;MEMORY&lt;/code&gt; engine tables would be dynamically allocated on top of the other buffers the database uses, making the process size quite variable, depending on how many concurrent threads need to use temporary tables right now. This can lead to memory exhaustion and a visit from the OOM killer, or worse, to a paged out database server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When being streamed out to disk, the original variable length data types would be used, so you would not even see what caused the temporary table on disk in many cases, unless you looked very hard at the schema.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory for efficient MyISAM table processing is usually not configured on an InnoDB MySQL instance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of that, we encouraged our users at work to be wary of plans with &lt;code&gt;using temporary&lt;/code&gt;, to avoid use of utf8 columns except for human generated data, and to employ certain techniques for writing queries that handle strings in a nicer way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;mysql-8-fixes-this&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#mysql-8-fixes-this&#34;&gt;
	MySQL 8 fixes this
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with MySQL 8, implicit temporary tables are using the InnoDB storage engine exclusively. That means, temporary tables have largely the same properties as any ordinary table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is safe to use &lt;code&gt;VARCHAR(...) CHARSET utf8mb4&lt;/code&gt;, and at work we now recommend that you use this to represent strings. Variable length data types are handled just fine. It is fine to use single byte character sets for internal strings (names of status fields and other internal strings), but even that is no longer necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no preconfigured limit to where the table is being streamed to disk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is being done by creating (internally and invisibly to you) a special tablespace for tmp tables. Tables created in this tablespace are InnoDB tables, but they are not redo-logged, because there is no need for them to be crash-safe. After all, tmp tables are supposed to be gone after a server restart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This saves a ton of I/O and makes these tables very fast, while they are still compatible with the rest of the InnoDB engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tmp tables are now also using the InnoDB buffer pool, the fixed giant data structure that all other data in the server is using, so the memory consumption of the server process fluctuates a lot less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All pages in the buffer pool need to be backed by files, so that they can be written out if space in the buffer pool becomes tight. For MySQL, this is the &lt;code&gt;innodb_temp_data_file_path config&lt;/code&gt; variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work, we configure this on our systems with a hard upper limit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;innodb_temp_data_file_path=ibtmp1:12M:autoextend:max:100G
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means you get a file, &lt;code&gt;ibtmp1&lt;/code&gt;, in the data directory of MySQL with an initial size of 12 MB. This file is auto-extended in increments up to a maximum size of 100 GB - in the default configuration it is not limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need more, you are very likely holding the database wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;i-am-getting-this-error-message&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#i-am-getting-this-error-message&#34;&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;I am getting this error message&amp;rdquo;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isolate the offending query, &lt;code&gt;EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON&lt;/code&gt; the plan and check if you can get rid of the &lt;code&gt;using temporary&lt;/code&gt;. If it is using up a 100 GB temporary file space, something is very wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should not increase the 100 GB limit: The &lt;code&gt;ibtmp1&lt;/code&gt; file will eat all your disk space, and you won&amp;rsquo;t get it back, as tablespace files never shrink.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MySQL: Two kinds of compression</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/09/09/mysql-two-kinds-of-compression.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 20:16:47 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/09/09/mysql-two-kinds-of-compression.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I never had much reason to use table compression, so I largely ignored the topic in MySQL.
I knew that MySQL had table compression since 5.1, but I also knew the implementation was horribly complicated and double stored all data.
There is also page compression, a feature introduced with 5.7, which replaces table compression and works much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;table-compression&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#table-compression&#34;&gt;
	Table Compression
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-table-compression.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Table Compression&lt;/a&gt;

 is available in MySQL 5.1 and newer.
It is used by setting an InnoDB table up with &lt;code&gt;ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED KEY_BLOCK_SIZE=8&lt;/code&gt; or similar, for even smaller key block sizes.
A lot of status tables in &lt;code&gt;INFORMATION_SCHEMA.%CMP%&lt;/code&gt; are available to monitor it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table compression creates smaller pages (in the size you specify with &lt;code&gt;KEY_BLOCK_SIZE&lt;/code&gt;), and loads and stores compressed pages of this smaller size from and to the buffer pool.
On load, a second uncompressed page in the buffer pool is allocated, and the data is uncompressed and put into this secondary page to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On write, the modified uncompressed page is recompressed and put back into the compressed buffer pool page.
As this happens on write and not on checkpoint, this is not ideal for tables that are written to a lot.
Compression and decompression happen in the Query thread, that is, the thread of your connection, and therefore single-threaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If buffer pool space it tight, uncompressed pages can be evicted, and recreated as needed by decompressing them again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be able to crash recover MySQL all possible shutdown scenarios, compressed pages are also written to the redo-log on checkpointing.
This also leads to larger redo-logs, which may need to be upsized to allow for the additional traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;page-compression&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#page-compression&#34;&gt;
	Page Compression
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Page compression was added to MySQL already in version 5.7.
It is a different way of handling compression of data in MySQL:
A transformer stage is inserted into the IO handlers of MySQL, which on flush compressed a page as it is written out, and on read decompressed the data into the buffer pool page.
This is much simpler approach that also interacts with a lot fewer parts of the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But since pages still are 16 KB on disk as they are in memory, an additional file system feature is required for this to actually save space:
Hole punching support in the file system.
The compressed page will be shorter than 16 KB, so all file system blocks that are unused at the end of the 16 KB will be marked as &amp;ldquo;unused&amp;rdquo; to the operating system.
This works well with all modern Linux kernels, and the ext4 and xfs file systems (and presumably a lot of others as well).
It does not play well with standard NTFS file systems due to the way NTFS handles things internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because page compression is so simple, it is also very simple to configure:
To enable a table for page compression, set the InnoDB table up with &lt;code&gt;COMPRESSION=&amp;quot;zlib&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;.
All newly written pages to this table will be compressed.
Old data stays uncompressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to compress all pages in a table that has just been switched to page compression, run &lt;code&gt;OPTIMIZE TABLE&lt;/code&gt; on it.
This will recreate the table, using the new options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The write-path for page level compression inserts itself into the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_page_cleaners&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;InnoDB page cleaners&lt;/a&gt;

.
By default, the number is 4, and there can be up to 64.
If your database writes a lot to compressed tables, it may be useful to increase this number.
Since compression uses CPU, it is not useful to set the number larger than the number of available cores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reads are done by query threads, except when they are not (They aren&amp;rsquo;t when there is read-ahead happening, in which case it is done by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_read_io_threads&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;background IO threads&lt;/a&gt;

).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not much monitoring in place, and it is hardly needed, because page compression is so much simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;checking-compression&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#checking-compression&#34;&gt;
	Checking compression
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To check the degree of compression, look at the files at the file system level:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;kris@server:~/sandboxes/msb_8_0_25/data/kris$ ls -lsih keks*
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;222085022  72M -rw-r----- 1 kris kris 252M Sep  9 15:17 keks2.ibd
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;222085011 253M -rw-r----- 1 kris kris 252M Sep  9 15:16 keks.ibd
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We see the apparent file size is the same for the uncompressed and compressed file.
The number of allocated blocks (second column) varies a lot, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original table &lt;code&gt;keks&lt;/code&gt; has been created as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;localhost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;8025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;msandbox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;kris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;keks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;G&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;being-careful-with-file-copies&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#being-careful-with-file-copies&#34;&gt;
	Being careful with file copies
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The granularity of the file system block size is 4 KB in our file system.
The hole punching works at the block level, so we can free 12 KB, 8 KB or 4 KB of a 16 KB page.
Even if the data in the page compressed to, say, 9 KB, it will still use 3 file system blocks of 4 KB out of the group of 4 that make up the file system storage for a page.
So MySQL will only be able to give back 4 KB of space to the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holes in files can fill when you copy the file naively:
Copying &lt;code&gt;keks2.ibd&lt;/code&gt; around without a hole-aware tool will fill the holes.
That means: the copy of the 72 MB source file will be a 252 MB destination file.
A secure way to copy the file would be  rsync with the appropriate options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holes in files are also causing disk seeks.
This is not an issue for any SSD or NVME flash, but can hurt performance on hard disks.
On the other hand, this is 2021, and whoever is still running a database on HDD probably deserves no better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;tldr&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#tldr&#34;&gt;
	TL;DR
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given all the above, for my usage scenarios there is probably no use for table compression anywhere for any reason.
I should be using page compression everywhere where I need it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MySQL: A job queue in Python</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/07/13/mysql-a-job-queue-in-python.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 19:51:59 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/07/13/mysql-a-job-queue-in-python.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Somebody needed a job queue in Python:
Multiple writers insert into it in random order, and the jobs are written into the MySQL table &lt;code&gt;jobs&lt;/code&gt;.
From the &lt;code&gt;jobs&lt;/code&gt; table, multiple consumers claim jobs in batches of &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; or smaller (n=100), and process them.
After processing, the consumers delete the jobs. We need concurrent job generation and consumption, with proper and efficient locking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full source for this example can be seen in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/isotopp/mysql-dev-examples&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;mysql-dev-examples&lt;/a&gt;

 in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/isotopp/mysql-dev-examples/blob/master/mysql-claim-jobs/mysql-claim-jobs.py&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;mysql-claim-jobs.py&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our table, the fields &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt; represent the job payload.
We will later select jobs for processing based on the contents of the &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; field, so we create an index on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each job has a &lt;code&gt;status&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;unclaimed&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;claimed&lt;/code&gt;, and for debugging &lt;code&gt;done&lt;/code&gt; instead of being deleted), an owner and an access date which we update when we change the claim status of the job.
As we access jobs by status, we also index on &lt;code&gt;status&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	Multiprocessing
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We generate a set of two generators that concurrently insert jobs into the &lt;code&gt;jobs&lt;/code&gt; table, and a set of ten consumers that take jobs out of the &lt;code&gt;jobs&lt;/code&gt; table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;code&gt;multiprocessing&lt;/code&gt;, we are using &lt;code&gt;Process&lt;/code&gt; to handle this.
Each of these processes is getting an identification number as a parameter using the &lt;code&gt;args=&lt;/code&gt; named parameter to the constructor.
We will later use this in the &lt;code&gt;consumer()&lt;/code&gt; to track the owner of a claimed job.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-generators&#34;&gt;
	The Generators
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our generator takes the &lt;code&gt;generator_id&lt;/code&gt; as a parameter, but makes no use of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We generate random &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt; fields, and use auto-incremented numbers to identify the individual jobs.
The new job has the status of &lt;code&gt;unclaimed&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;owner_id&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;owner_date&lt;/code&gt; are &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;.
For speed, we commit to the jobs table only every tenth job.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our consumers need to claim unclaimed jobs that fulfill a condition from the &lt;code&gt;jobs&lt;/code&gt; table.
For simplicity, we claim rows that start with a random character, for example &amp;lsquo;a%&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;unclaimed&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;LIKE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;a%&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if we did it like this, we would run into two problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We do not get the claimed records for processing.
We would need to select them after claiming them (&lt;code&gt;SELECT id, d, e FROM jobs WHERE status = &#39;claimed&#39; AND owner_id = ?&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;UPDATE&lt;/code&gt; statement produces X-locks, and these persist until we commit.
Other processes trying to claim jobs run the risk of running into our X-locks while scanning the table.
These processes would hang.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need another approach to handle this to make it efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;smart-approach-using-select--for-update-skip-locked&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#smart-approach-using-select--for-update-skip-locked&#34;&gt;
	Smart approach using &lt;code&gt;SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with MySQL 8, we get the option &lt;code&gt;SKIP LOCKED&lt;/code&gt; when running select.
This is documented in &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-locking-reads.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;the manual&lt;/a&gt;

 as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A locking read that uses SKIP LOCKED never waits to acquire a row lock.
The query executes immediately, removing locked rows from the result set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;FOR UPDATE&lt;/code&gt; we could read the rows we want and mark them for a later &lt;code&gt;UPDATE&lt;/code&gt; with X-locks.
At the same time we ignore the records already marked for later updates by other processes without stopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is precisely what we need.
In order to mark only the rows we are intending to claim as locked, we need to access the rows in our &lt;code&gt;SELECT .. .FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED&lt;/code&gt; statement by primary key.
That is, our statement needs to have the form &lt;code&gt;SELECT ... FROM jobs WHERE id IN ( 1, 2, 3 ) FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED&lt;/code&gt;.
We need another &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; statement before the locking &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; in order to translate our condition into a set of primary keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is the plan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run a query to find a set of candidate primary keys (100 or fewer).
This query can run outside our transaction and could use a replica to find a set of candidate primary keys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start a transaction.
This happens all the time and automatically in Python.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In our transaction, run the &lt;code&gt;SELECT ... FROM josb WHERE id IN (...) FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED&lt;/code&gt; as discussed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the result of the previous &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; statement, run the &lt;code&gt;UPDATE&lt;/code&gt; to claim the jobs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;COMMIT&lt;/code&gt; to drop the X-locks, and make the change visible to other processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the set of candidate primary keys can be up to 100 ids in size, but can also be empty:
We are searching for unclaimed jobs that start with a randomly selected letter, and it may be there are none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the set of claimed primary keys can be identical to the candidate primary key set, or smaller.
It may be empty, even if the candidate set was not:
In this case all candidates have been snatched up by other consumers before we could.
We may want to count and log that, in order to detect if our concurrency in consumers is too high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;candidate_ids&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;fetchall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;id&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ow&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;candidate_ids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are using some arbitrary SQL condition to find records.
In our example, we are using &lt;code&gt;WHERE d LIKE &#39;a%&#39; AND status = &#39;unclaimed&#39;&lt;/code&gt;, for variable initial letters and for variable status values.
We are only interested into the primary keys, so we return only these, in a &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;consuming-jobs&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#consuming-jobs&#34;&gt;
	Consuming jobs
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual &lt;code&gt;consumer()&lt;/code&gt; then looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;consumer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;consumer_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;MySQLdb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;db_config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is, we call &lt;code&gt;find_candidates()&lt;/code&gt; to generate a list of candidate ids.
If we did not find any, we run a &lt;code&gt;db.commit()&lt;/code&gt; before we &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt;.
This is rather important: We are in a transaction here, and in &lt;code&gt;REPEATABLE READ&lt;/code&gt; isolation that means we get a consistent read view.
If we simply tried again, using only &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt;, we would stay in the same transaction and would never see the &lt;code&gt;jobs&lt;/code&gt; table update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the set of candidate ids, we then run the locking &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; as discussed above.
This does two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it returns the data, which we pick up using &lt;code&gt;claimed_records = c.fetchall()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it also X-locks the rows for claiming them permanently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We generate a list of &lt;code&gt;claimed_ids&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;code&gt;claimed_records&lt;/code&gt;, and check that this list is non-empty.
If it was empty, we did have a list of candidate ids, but none of them came through.
That means another concurrent process snatched the candidates from us - all of them.
We should be recording this, but are not in this example program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then run the actual &lt;code&gt;UPDATE&lt;/code&gt; that marks the jobs as claimed, and updates the owner and the datetime of taking possession.
We need to &lt;code&gt;db.commit()&lt;/code&gt; here to write this status change to disk.
This will now also be visible to other processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can now proceed to actually process these records at our leisure.
This may take time, which we simulate with a tiny wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After processing has finished, we delete the jobs from the &lt;code&gt;jobs&lt;/code&gt; table, and commit again to make the deletion visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;run-log&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#run-log&#34;&gt;
	Run log
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can see how each consumer grabs a variable number of jobs for processing, sometimes single jobs, sometimes many more.
If we let the thing run for some time, we see that the ids increment.
When we stop the output with Ctrl-S, we also block the consumers.
On resume, very many jobs are lingering in the queue, and initially the consumers claim a large list of ids on each grab.
This quickly goes back to normal levels after the number of jobs in the queue goes down to normal levels, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can check queue length and status in the database:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#summary&#34;&gt;
	Summary
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We created a job queue in the database, using a concurrent Python program.
To select jobs efficiently, we reduce an arbitrary query to a set of candidate primary keys.
We then use a &lt;code&gt;SELECT ... FROM jobs WHERE id IN ( ... ) FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED&lt;/code&gt; to create a set of X-locks on the candidate records using &lt;code&gt;FOR UPDATE&lt;/code&gt;.
At the same time, we avoid waiting on other threads&amp;rsquo; X-locks using the &lt;code&gt;SKIP LOCKED&lt;/code&gt; functionality new in MySQL 8.
We then use the data fetched by the &lt;code&gt;SELECT FOR UPDATE&lt;/code&gt; to commit permanent ownership for these records, and also use this data for processing.
After processing we clean up by deleting the jobs from the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach can be scaled further by partitioning the &lt;code&gt;jobs&lt;/code&gt; table, if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Database as a Queue</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/01/28/database-as-a-queue.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 28 Jan 2021 08:02:20 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/01/28/database-as-a-queue.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The DBA experience at work suggests that every single schema at some point in its lifecycle holds a queue table. These are tables in which some processes (the “producers”) put rows, which a swarm of other processes (the “consumers”) lock and consume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variation on that theme is the state machine, in which jobs are placed by producers. Consumers do not immediately delete them, but update them a few times to indicate processing progress, before the rows are ultimately being deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another variation is using the search and sort capabilities of the database to fetch jobs from the queue out of order (“queue with lookahead and selective de-queueing”), while still maintaining the exactly-once semantics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-a-database-as-a-queue-can-be-ok-ish&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#using-a-database-as-a-queue-can-be-ok-ish&#34;&gt;
	Using a database as a queue can be ok-ish
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a database as a queue is not wrong, up to a point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You get ACID semantics. That means your updates are atomic and isolated, transactional, and they are durable, persisted to disk. This makes it possible to build queues with “exactly once” execution semantics, which is a thing developers like a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You already have a database handle, and you already understand your ORM, so you do not have to pile on more dependencies, and you do not need to learn additional technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, once you pass “the point” in that “up to a point” phrase, things get nasty:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Exactly once”  semantics are really expensive to implement: They require that each insert, delete or update is associated with a transaction, which in turn is associated with a disk write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get to enqueue, dequeue and state change your things exactly as quickly as a single server can flash its disk lights, and in the next step, as quickly as your replication hierarchy can pass on things downstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On bare-metal, that costs you a bit, but because bare-metal gives you awesome amounts of capacity with very little jitter for very reasonable amounts of money, we can bear quite a bit of this work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the cloud, using a database-as-a-queue is approximately equivalent to pouring petrol on money and throwing a match. It is the wrong technology for that kind of workload in that environment from the get-go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;not-using-databases-as-queues&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#not-using-databases-as-queues&#34;&gt;
	Not using databases as queues
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;replayability&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#replayability&#34;&gt;
	Replayability
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One specific property of the above setup that is expensive, and hard to reproduce outside a transactional database is the exactly-once thing. “At most once (maybe never)” or “at least once (maybe multiple times)” are alternative queue semantics that are much cheaper to implement, because they allow you to get rid of disk writes, and also of many disk seeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kafka for example gives you “at least once”: You get to consume a stream, and you can jump backwards and re-consume what you already saw, in order, no searching. The jump backwards is possible for a small window of a few hours or a day, or whatever other deal you can make with the Kafka team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the same item multiple times is not a problem if the jobs in the queue are idempotent, that is, replayable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not replayable are relative updates: “set x = x + 1”, “add an order to the table, give me the ordernumber”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replayable are absolute updates: “set x = 7” (you read 6, did the math and enqueued 7), “add order 17372 to order table” (you made an order number beforehand and push the order into the queue with an already fixed identity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, to make things idempotent, you need to give them either fixed identities so that you can remember if you saw things before, or you need to make the writes absolute instead of incremental, or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you find a way to group your jobs into transactions, and make all individual operations in your transaction replayable, you could push the entire stream through Kafka, and it would be cheaper. Much cheaper, in fact, in a cloud environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;re-queuing-and-sorting&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#re-queuing-and-sorting&#34;&gt;
	Re-queuing and sorting
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use a queue table with selecting and sorting (“queue with lookahead and selective dequeueing” from above), you can look into consuming a block of things from your input queue and splitting them into multiple streams or different topics, or maybe sort them and re-queue them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So basically, instead of pushing things into a single queue and then grabbing items out of order, you can consume the input in blocks, perform your intermediate selection and sorting process and them push to multiple outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the result can ride on Kafka instead of MySQL and would be more cloud-compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;re-queuing-updates&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#re-queuing-updates&#34;&gt;
	Re-queuing updates
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the state machine use-case you would have to solve writing updates to a base record, before it is finally consumed in total.
Your state machine would be eating one item from the input, perform the associated action, and then push the updated record back into the same, or a different queue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-if-i-dont&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-if-i-dont&#34;&gt;
	What if I don’t?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;undo-log-woes&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#undo-log-woes&#34;&gt;
	Undo-Log woes
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2019/11/18/a-blast-from-the-past.html&#34;&gt;A Blast From The Past&lt;/a&gt;

 we see what happens to MySQL with long-running transactions, and in &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/07/27/mysql-transactions.html&#34;&gt;MySQL Transactions&lt;/a&gt;

 we discuss what goes on internally in the database when we do transactions, and especially how that can be painful if these transactions are long-running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that any database will at some point in time have long-running transactions, even if your code does not. Database maintenance operations such as cloning replicas or making backups can do that without interruption only by maintaining a read view, which leads to Undo-Log explosion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So queue-as-a-database will eventually explosively grow the undo-log, or individual tables, and disk space from these structures is hard to reclaim by the operating system. You will run at some point in time into disk space problems from churn, even if the absolute amount of data is small.
Binlog woes and Replication Delay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a replicated MySQL changes to any table (also queue tables) are written to the binlog, which is being kept for a few days for point in time recovery and for replication. This uses disk space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that any write is binlogged, even deletes. So when you delete data, you have less disk space (because deletes are binlogged), until after a few days the binlog is purged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The binlog is being consumed by replicas as close to realtime as possible. But if you write too much, again, it is possible to overwhelm the replicas, and you will experience replication delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your producers write to the replication primary, but your consumers read from the replicas, replication delay will add additional latency. You will be unhappy (and see Kafka, above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;this-is-per-instance&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#this-is-per-instance&#34;&gt;
	This is per-instance
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also important to remember that this is per-instance, not per-table, and also not per-schema. The purge thread looks at transactions, not at schemas or tables. In a transaction, a number of changes to the instance can happen, atomically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So imagine a shared mysqld process that has 1000 customers with different schemas, all of them unrelated, and one of them opens a transaction and keep it open for four hours. The purge thread will stop for all the customers, because in theory it is possible to have a single transaction that spans all 1000 customer’s schemas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The undo-log will grow out of bounds, and all 1000 customers will experience slow queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how you denial-of-service a shared MySQL with no effort or expense at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-should-i-do-and-what-is-the-limit&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-should-i-do-and-what-is-the-limit&#34;&gt;
	What should I do? And what is the limit?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a developer, you want to write an application and get it going without piling on a lot of dependencies or learning too many technologies, or dealing with limitations such as unreliable or repeated queue deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MySQL can deliver such things, up to a point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is okay for a prototype. If you implement queues, state-machines or other rapidly writing structures in a MySQL, you should monitor transaction volume and prepare an escape strategy early, and implement that in time. Tech debt is okay, if it is managed properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a benchmark, and for comparison: At this point in time, one specific application at work processes around 7-10 million auto-increment values per replication hierarchy per hour, with several updates per row. That is where we run into operational toil due to pushing the envelope.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That is around 3.000 new rows per second, and a multiple of that with updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An unconstrained bare-metal SSD can do around 20.000 commits per second in hardware.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That is why we run into operational toil with 3.000 new rows (with multiple updates per rows) per second with said application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our replication assumes around 2.000 transactions/s as minimum capability.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can batch up some things and apply them in parallel, if the transaction structure allows that. That is why replication does not lag, even if the primary does more than 2.000 txn/s. How much parallel replication can help here is completely dependent on the ordering constraints imposed by the transactions themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the cloud, the limits are likely to be much lower, depending on instance and volume sizes chosen, and going there is a solid cost item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need to look at things with a much sharper lens.&lt;/p&gt;

. Note that the data generator there defines more indexes - see below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our example we generate one million rows, and assume a general niceness of 0.9 (90% of the children are nice). Also, all of our children have 64 characters long names, a single 64 characters long wish, a random age, and are equidistributed on a perfect sphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our real planet is not a perfect sphere, and also not many people live in the Pacific Ocean. Also, not many children have 64 character names.&lt;/p&gt;

	Sorting it twice
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you even sort the data twice? Now, assuming we sort by name, we can run an increasingly deeply nested subquery:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;kris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;localhost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;kris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;santa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;behavior&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;nice&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can see &lt;code&gt;using filesort&lt;/code&gt;, so while we ask for the query result to be sorted by name twice, it is actually only sorted once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;no-sorting-at-all&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#no-sorting-at-all&#34;&gt;
	No sorting at all
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can improve on this, using a covering index in appropriate order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The query is now annotated &lt;code&gt;using index&lt;/code&gt;, which means that all data we ask for is present in the (covering) index &lt;code&gt;behavior_name&lt;/code&gt;, and is stored in sort order. That means the data is physically stored and read in sort order and no actual sorting has to be done on read - despite us asking for sorting, twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hidden-select--and-index-condition-pushdown&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#hidden-select--and-index-condition-pushdown&#34;&gt;
	Hidden &amp;lsquo;SELECT *&amp;rsquo; and Index Condition Pushdown
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the example above, we have been asking for &lt;code&gt;s.name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;t.name&lt;/code&gt; only, and because the name is part of the index, &lt;code&gt;using index&lt;/code&gt; is shown to indicate use of a covering index. We do not actually go to the table to generate the result set, we are using the index only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if we were to ask for &lt;code&gt;t.*&lt;/code&gt; in the middle subquery, what will happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;Code 1003 Note&lt;/code&gt; we still see the exact same reconstituted query, but as can be seen in the plan annotations, the internal handling changes - so the optimizer has not been working on this query at all times, but on some intermediary representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;lsquo;using index condition&amp;rsquo; annotation points to &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/index-condition-pushdown-optimization.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Index Condition Pushdown Optimization&lt;/a&gt;

 being used. In our example, this is not good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;worse-than-sorting-selectivity&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#worse-than-sorting-selectivity&#34;&gt;
	Worse than sorting: Selectivity
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The column we select on is a column with a cardinality of 2: &lt;code&gt;behavior&lt;/code&gt; can be either &lt;code&gt;naughty&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;nice&lt;/code&gt;. That means, in an equidistribution, around half of the values are &lt;code&gt;naughty&lt;/code&gt;, the other half is &lt;code&gt;nice&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data from disk is read in pages of 16 KB. If one row in a page matches, the entire page has to be read from disk. In our example, we have a row length of around 200 Byte, so we end up with 75-80 records per page. Half of them will be &lt;code&gt;nice&lt;/code&gt;, so with an average of around 40 &lt;code&gt;nice&lt;/code&gt; records per page, we will very likely have to read all pages from disk anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the index will not decrease the amount of data read from disk at all. In fact, we will have to read the index pages on top of the data pages, so using an index on a low cardinality column has the potential of making the situation slightly worse than even a full table scan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, defining an index on a low cardinality column is usually not helpful - if there are 10 or fewer values, benchmark carefully and decide, or just don&amp;rsquo;t define an index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case, the index is not even equidistributed, but biased to 90% &lt;code&gt;nice&lt;/code&gt;. We end up with mostly &lt;code&gt;nice&lt;/code&gt; records, so we can guarantee that all data pages will be read for the SQL &lt;code&gt;SELECT * FROM santa WHERE behavior = &amp;quot;nice&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, and the index usage will not be contributing in any positive way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could try to improve the query by adding conditions to make it more selective. For example, we could ask for people close to our current position, using an RTREE index such as this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;kris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;localhost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;kris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;ALTER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;santa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;ADD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;SPATIAL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;INDEX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;loc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;kris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;localhost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;kris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;rect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;polygon((10 10, 10 20, 20 20, 20 10, 10 10 ))&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;kris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;localhost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;kris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;santa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mbrcovers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;st_geomfromtext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;rect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;loc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1535&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;rows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;53&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;ALTER&lt;/code&gt; defines a spatial index (an RTREE), which can help to speed up coordinate queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;SET&lt;/code&gt; defines a coordinate rectangle around our current position (supposedly 15/15).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then use the &lt;code&gt;mbrcovers()&lt;/code&gt; function to find all points &lt;code&gt;loc&lt;/code&gt; that are covered by the &lt;code&gt;@rect&lt;/code&gt;. It seems to be somewhat complicated to get MySQL to actually use the index, but I have not been investigating deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we added an &lt;code&gt;ORDER BY name&lt;/code&gt; here, we would see &lt;code&gt;using filesort&lt;/code&gt; again, because data is retrieved in RTREE order, if the index &lt;code&gt;loc&lt;/code&gt; is used, but we want output in &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#conclusion&#34;&gt;
	Conclusion
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Santa query is inefficient, but likely sorting twice is not the root cause for that.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The optimizer will be able to merge the multiple sorts and be able to deliver the result with one or no sorting, depending on our index construction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The optimizer is not using the reconstituted query shown in the warning to plan the execution, and that is weird.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selectivity matters, especially for indices on low cardinality columns.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asking for all &lt;code&gt;nice&lt;/code&gt; behaviors on a &lt;code&gt;naughty&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;nice&lt;/code&gt; column is usually not benefiting from index usage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additional indexable conditions that improve selectivity can help, a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>MySQL: Backups and Replication</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/11/27/backups-and-replication.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Nov 2020 12:40:33 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/11/27/backups-and-replication.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There was a question at work about MySQL backups and restore. I needed to explain more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use databases to make state persistent. That is: As a developer you can think of your database as a single giant, structured global variable with a weird access method, and to make things worse, concurrent access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A database is just a global variable to your code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can log statements that change the state of our database in a log. In MySQL, we call this &lt;em&gt;The Binlog&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2020/11/replication-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Making a change to the database, and logging the data changing statement to the binlog.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we make a full backup of the database, we just copy away all tables in the data directory while the database does not change. This can be achieved by simply taking the server offline during the copy, or using more elegant methods that do not interrupt production, yet still look the same when done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the database does not change while we make the backup, the backup is internally referentially consistent, and it is associated with exactly one binlog position. And to keep things simple, the binlog position is  just the pair &lt;code&gt;(newest binlog filename, file length)&lt;/code&gt;. So a binlog position looks like &lt;code&gt;(binlog.000004, 7625)&lt;/code&gt; or similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The server will periodically start new binlogs: When it becomes too large, when the server restarts, or when we ask it to do so using a &lt;code&gt;FLUSH BINARY LOGS&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every transaction that changes data is being assigned a unique binlog position, and this way we also get a total order of all transactions (and that is becoming a problem later in the game).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2020/11/replication-02.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We can see the binlog position as the internal clock of the database: Whenever something changes in the database, it is written to the binlog. Each transaction is assigned a unique binlog position, and thus, transactions also have a total order.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we restore from a backup, we are at the backups binlog position of the past, and can then replay statements – beginning with the backups position – to roll forward, until we are at the desired position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use the binlog to replay history&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the desired position exactly &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; depends a bit on the problem: If we issued a command we wish we had not, the desired position is, of course, exactly before this statement. We then skip the undesirable statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How we continue after that statement depends on what that statement was. But if we are lucky we can simply continue to replay statements unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In complicated cases (We might have changed a table definition wrongly) we might need to replace the content of the binlog with alternate, edited statements. In any case we create a new, different and edited timeline that does not contain the mistake we made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;replication-is-an-ongoing-live-restore&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#replication-is-an-ongoing-live-restore&#34;&gt;
	Replication is an ongoing live Restore
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As early as MySQL 3.23.15 from May 2000, we have replication:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We restore our original servers&amp;rsquo; data directory to a new machine, effectively cloning it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We tell our clone the binlog position of the parent server it was created from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We tell this new machine where the parent server is, and give it credentials to log in to that parent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cloned server will then log in to the parent, download the binlog as it is written, and apply it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the same process as with a restore and then applying the binlog that has been created since the backup was made. But with replication, it is live and ongoing as new binlog is being created. As a result, we get a cloned server that executes the same statements as its upstream parent, keeping its internal state a mirror copy of the parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We called the parent server a &lt;em&gt;master&lt;/em&gt; back then, and a &lt;em&gt;primary&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;source server&lt;/em&gt; these days. The cloned server was a &lt;em&gt;slave&lt;/em&gt; back then and is now a &lt;em&gt;replica&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this simplistic approach has all kinds of problems, which then got corrected over time, making replication better, but also more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;splitting-threads&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#splitting-threads&#34;&gt;
	Splitting Threads
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early replication had a single thread downloading statements, and then applying them. Of course, some statements take longer than others to execute: a large &lt;code&gt;ALTER TABLE&lt;/code&gt; can take hours to run, depending on the size of the table being altered. During that time replication stops and the binlog does not even leave the source server. This is a bit unfortunate should the source fail during that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the very first thing that got changed is splitting the replication thread in two: The &lt;code&gt;IO_THREAD&lt;/code&gt; downloads data from the source as quickly as possible, and writes it to the replica as the relay log. Even when the source goes down we still have our local copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;SQL_THREAD&lt;/code&gt; then reads the relay log and executes it in sequence, strictly maintaining transaction order. Whenever it finishes a relay log, it can delete that file and turn to the next one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This logic, at the core, is unchanged even today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2020/11/replication-03.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Simple, asynchronous replication as seen even today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;asynchronous-and-semi-synchronous-replication&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#asynchronous-and-semi-synchronous-replication&#34;&gt;
	Asynchronous and Semi-Synchronous Replication
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We call this kind of replication asynchronous: There is no feedback channel from the replica to the source, and consequently no way for the source to delay the commit and have the application wait until the data has left the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asynchronous replication scales well, even across long distance links: Applications write to the primary, and don’t wait. The replicas log into the source, download the binlogs and will eventually execute it locally on the replica. Applications reading from the replicas will read outdated state until the replica comes around and catches up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main risk is the source going down due to a fault before the binlog has been copied  off. So one innovation is to make the source delay the commit until at least one copy exists on a replica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that we need add a communication mechanism to the replica, in which it can signal that is has read a transaction from the binary log, and committed it to the local relay log. Only when the transaction is persisted to disk on the replica, in the relay log, we signal the source, which then lets the transaction commit finish so that the application can continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semi-Synchronous Replication is Asynchronous Replication with added delays on the commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;Semi-Synchronous Replication&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;SSR&lt;/em&gt;, in MySQL, and it comes with a number of caveats:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSR has a timeout. If a transaction is not acknowledged in time, a message is error logged and the server reverts to regular asynchronous replication. It will flip back to SSR once a replica responds within the timeout window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a source has zero replicas and a really high timeout, it never receives an acknowledgement, and will essentially block all applications. If your requirement is “transactions must be persisted on more than a single machine to be valid”, this is the desired behaviour. If your requirement is “It is more important to persist things at all than to ever hang the business”, then ASR is better than SSR for your use case. Nonetheless, we have plenty of outages because of this: primary servers ending up with zero replicas due to bugs or circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSR guarantees that at least one more copy of the transaction exists, but it does not say where. To build a resilient system, you need orchestration to find out where, and make sure you fail to that machine in order to be able to continue. We are using a special program for this kind of orchestration, and it is being ingeniously called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/openark/orchestrator&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MySQL Orchestrator&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depending on where your replicas reside, the most advanced replica server may be in the same data center or AZ as the source. In a scenario where the entire AZ fails this does not help you at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;statement-and-row-based-replication&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#statement-and-row-based-replication&#34;&gt;
	Statement and Row Based Replication
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MySQL&amp;rsquo;s replication logs statements to the binlog. Unfortunately, not all statements are actually replay-able, because they may not be deterministic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MySQL knows this, and for the obvious cases logs additional code that makes them deterministic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;kris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;localhost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;kris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;flush&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;logs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is being logged is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The RAND_SEED values to make the statement deterministic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The timestamp of the server when executing the statement (this will also make the NOW() function deterministic).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The actual statement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the warning, this replicates well, and has done so for the last 20 years. What does not replicate well at all, ever, is stuff like &lt;code&gt;UPDATE t SET x = x+1 LIMIT 10&lt;/code&gt;. As this lacks an &lt;code&gt;ORDER BY&lt;/code&gt; clause, the server is free to order the row updates as it wishes, and can (and in NDB cluster actually will!) update 10 random rows, different ones on each instance of replication. It is the &lt;code&gt;LIMIT&lt;/code&gt; clause that makes this non-deterministic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that limitations of this approach are clear, we can see: We would be better off with logging the rows changed, instead of logging the statements that change them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counterintuitively, for the workloads we have at work, this is also 50% to 66% smaller than the statement itself, even before optimisation and compression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;(You would need to run &lt;code&gt;mysqlbinlog -vvv&lt;/code&gt; to have the mysqlbinlog command decode the BASE64 for you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Row Based Replication logs Row Events. &lt;code&gt;mysqlbinlog&lt;/code&gt; presents them as a special &lt;code&gt;BINLOG&lt;/code&gt; statement to make it possible to feed the output to another server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in order to be able to represent a Row Events as a statement that can be replayed in another server, MySQL implemented a &lt;code&gt;BINLOG&lt;/code&gt; statement, which takes a single parameter.
The parameter is a BASE64 encoded pre- and post-image of the row, a kind of binary patch to the data in the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing this, I should be able to take this &lt;code&gt;BINLOG&lt;/code&gt; statement and run it on the command line of my client:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;kris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;localhost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;kris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;BINLOG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;    &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;p8zAXxMBAAAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAOkAAAAAAAEABGtyaXMAAXQAAQUBCAEBAQCZVfvm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;gt; p8zAXx4BAAAALAAAAAAAAAAAAOkAAAAAAAEAAgAB/wABJeZMQInpPz9C5to=
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;    &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;/*!*/;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;ERROR 1609 (HY000): The BINLOG statement of type `Table_map` was not preceded by a format description BINLOG statement.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make a long story short: If you go back and pick up the preceding &lt;code&gt;BINLOG&lt;/code&gt; command earlier in the binlog, and then this one, it actually works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also interesting:
In the earliest versions of MySQL with Row Based logs, the &lt;code&gt;BINLOG&lt;/code&gt; command lacked all access controls.
By handcrafting the appropriate patches, anybody could change any data anywhere with any permissions - MySQL did not anticipate that somebody would take replication-only special commands and run them on a regular command line.
This bug is now a long time fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#row-based-replication-and-filters&#34;&gt;
	Row Based Replication and Filters
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the earliest days of replication, we could filter the binlog on the primary (using &lt;code&gt;binlog-do-*&lt;/code&gt; config directives) and the relay log on the replica (using &lt;code&gt;replicate-do-*&lt;/code&gt; config directives).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filtering the binlog is never a good idea: It will break your ability to perform point-in-time restores. Filtering the relay log can be done, but most of the config directives that do this are broken:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;replicate-do-db&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;replicate-ignore-db&lt;/code&gt; are matching the current database in statement based replication, and the actual statements&amp;rsquo; database in row based replication. The statement &lt;code&gt;use a; insert into b.t values (...);&lt;/code&gt; will be filtered differently in SBR than in RBR under a &lt;code&gt;replicate-do-db=a&lt;/code&gt; rule. With the default setting of &lt;code&gt;row-format=MIXED&lt;/code&gt;, the behavior is random, depending on the row format chosen by mysql.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;replicate-do/ignore-table&lt;/code&gt; are tedious, they require you to state each table explicitly, and nobody really wants to use them/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;replicate-wild-do/ignore-table&lt;/code&gt; work in SBR and RBR, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-rules-table-options.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;precedence&lt;/a&gt;

 is complicated, and it is advisable to use either only positive or only negative logic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With group replication, which we do not discuss here, any filtering will break consistency in the group, so any filters are forbidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summary of all that is basically: Don&amp;rsquo;t use binlog or replication filters, but if you have to, it&amp;rsquo;s best to stick to either &lt;code&gt;replicate-wild-do-table&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;replicate-wild-ignore-table&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	Row Based Replication and BLOB columns
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Row Based Replication also fails in other interesting ways: Consider a table with a BLOB and a counter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;rows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;affected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;05&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you increment the counter, the entire row is logged, twice: Once as a pre-image, and once again as a post-image. You end up with 4 bytes integer changing, but two full copies of the &lt;code&gt;BLOB&lt;/code&gt;, which can be very large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how we got the setting &lt;code&gt;binlog-row-image&lt;/code&gt;, which can be &lt;code&gt;FULL&lt;/code&gt; (the default), &lt;code&gt;NOBLOB&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;MINIMAL&lt;/code&gt;. In &lt;code&gt;NOBLOB&lt;/code&gt; mode, blobs and text fields are not logged unless they change. In &lt;code&gt;MINIMAL&lt;/code&gt; mode, the pre-image contains only the primary key, and the post-image contains only the changed fields new values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use RBR in &lt;code&gt;FULL&lt;/code&gt; mode, not only for replication, but also for Change Data Capture, to feed Hadoop and Kafka with it. On the other hand, with  replication chains that are blobby require &lt;code&gt;NOBLOB&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;MINIMAL&lt;/code&gt; mode to not die on us.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#row-based-replication-and-primary-keys&#34;&gt;
	Row Based Replication and Primary Keys
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the replica, the RBR image needs to be applied. For this, the replica needs to find the row. It uses the pre-image to do this, and when the table has no primary key defined, this can be slow - it ends up being a full table scan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another fun cause of replication delay: Having a table of even moderate size without a primary key in a replication chain that uses RBR will delay the replica, and it will look very busy. The replica will eat a lot of CPU doing in-memory scans to find rows to change, in the most inefficient way possible.&lt;/p&gt;

	More complications…
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving at this stage took MySQL around 10 years:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can now reliably replicate, and build simple replication trees that are one level deep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of the relay log, binlog positions for the same statement vary between servers - transactions are locally renumbered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can replicate, but the &lt;code&gt;SQL_THREAD&lt;/code&gt; is a bottleneck: Replication is single-threaded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We still don’t have distributed transactions, or a way to handle writes to different primary servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has taken MySQL another 10 years of changes to improve on this, with Global Transaction IDs, Parallel Replication and Group Replication, but that is for another article.&lt;/p&gt;
