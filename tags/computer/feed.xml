 vorhanden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week was &amp;ldquo;Broken Security Software Advertising Week.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;fortigate-and-ivanti&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#fortigate-and-ivanti&#34;&gt;
	Fortigate and Ivanti
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, &lt;strong&gt;today&lt;/strong&gt; was Fortigate patch day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/schlangenoel-01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CVE-2024-23113, CVSSV3 Score 9.8, Unauthorized Code Execution, &amp;ldquo;Format String Bug&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A use of &lt;a href=&#34;https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/134.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;externally-controlled format string&lt;/a&gt;

 vulnerability
in FortiOS &lt;code&gt;fgfmd&lt;/code&gt; daemon may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code or
commands via specially crafted requests.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a case where a C function accepts a format string like &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;Blah %s Nonsense&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;,
to assemble a log message or a command for a &lt;code&gt;system()&lt;/code&gt; call.
However, the developer did not statically set the format parameter of the command to a format string
(&lt;code&gt;snprintf(buffer, length, &amp;quot;Blah %s Nonsense&amp;quot;, user_input)&lt;/code&gt;),
but instead took the user input as the format
(&lt;code&gt;snprintf(buffer, length, user_input))&lt;/code&gt;.
The user input can thus be used to do all sorts of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a mistake automatically detected by the usual source code scanners.
If you try to commit or merge something like this in a modern development environment,
the scanner will thoroughly humiliate you,
the commit will be rejected, and you will be assigned a security training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means this type of error does not occur in a contemporary development environment anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;strong&gt;yesterday&lt;/strong&gt; was Fortigate patch day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/schlangenoel-02.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CVE-2024-21762, CVSSV3 Score 9.6, Unauthorized Code Execution, &amp;ldquo;Out of Bounds Write&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A &lt;a href=&#34;https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;out-of-bounds write&lt;/a&gt;

 vulnerability
in FortiOS may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code or command via specially crafted HTTP requests.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a mistake easily made in C or other languages without index checking when accessing arrays.
In C, for example, one can access memory before the array using negative indices,
and if an error code is -1, but the error code is not checked after a function call, then everything goes up in flames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of error is not always found by source code scanners with a static analyzer,
but most cases should be flagged by the scanner as a code smell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, unfortunately, &lt;strong&gt;the day before yesterday&lt;/strong&gt; was also a Fortigate patch day.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fortinet-warns-of-new-fortisiem-rce-bugs-in-confusing-disclosure/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;BleepingComputer reports&lt;/a&gt;

:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this instance, due to an issue with the API which we are currently investigating,
rather than an edit, this resulted in two new CVEs being created, duplicates of the original CVE-2023-34992,
FortiNet told BleepingComputer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it turns out that CVE-2024-23108 and CVE-2024-23109 are actually patch bypasses for the CVE-2023-34992
flaw discovered by Horizon3 vulnerability expert Zach Hanley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this was a patch for a patch because the mitigation didn&amp;rsquo;t work,
and Fortinet got confused with the CVE numbers due to the sheer volume of them currently open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the US CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency)
is demanding all US institutions to shut down Ivanti VPN (formerly Juniper Pulse Secure):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/schlangenoel-03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;CISA is requiring all Federal agencies to disconnect Ivanti products by Friday at midnight
(Ivanti Connect Secure &amp;amp; Ivanti Policy Secure).
This is roughly 48-hours notice, to not patch, but rip it out!
Ivanti is an American company.
This is unprecedented.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/supplemental-direction-v1-ed-24-01-mitigate-ivanti-connect-secure-and-ivanti-policy-secure&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;original directive&lt;/a&gt;


could initially be interpreted as an update, re-installation, and reconfiguration, this hope has now been dashed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patches mentioned are not suitable for fixing the error.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://infosec.exchange/@briankrebs/111863433959430768&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Brian Krebs has summarized this issue&lt;/a&gt;

:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, someone opened up the Ivanti image and took a look inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/schlangenoel-04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Versions of software that have been routinely outdated for more than a decade in the current image.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As curl developer Stefan Eissing phrases it, these are &amp;ldquo;corpse parts and zombie software.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, as expected, a few days after the CISA-mandated patch frenzy,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ivanti-patch-new-connect-secure-auth-bypass-bug-immediately/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;BleepingComputer headlines again&lt;/a&gt;

:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ivanti: Patch new Connect Secure auth bypass bug immediately&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flaw (CVE-2024-22024) is due to an XXE
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;XML eXternal Entities&lt;/a&gt;

) weakness in the gateways&amp;rsquo; SAML component
that lets remote attackers gain access to restricted resources on unpatched appliances in low-complexity
attacks without requiring user interaction or authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAML, Security Assertion Markup Language, is an XML notation for access rights in Single Sign-On systems.
Because it&amp;rsquo;s an XML notation, it can have these &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;blablub;&lt;/code&gt; things – Entities – that are replaced by other text.
With External Entities, the replacement text is not locally fixed but is downloaded from the net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean in the context of SAML?
It means that the access rights in the document are not necessarily fixed;
an attacker can load Entity definitions from the net.
Depending on where the Entity is used, it can partially or completely rewrite the SAML file and grant different rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XML parsers are well understood,
and XXE is something that can be reliably scanned for automatically with a source code scanner.
This type of error is easily avoidable in modern development environments.&lt;/p&gt;

	Antivirus and Endpoint Security
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not an exception and is not limited to VPN gateways,
but rather manufacturers of security software happily rely on
&amp;ldquo;security-relevant software with privileges, and programming methods from the 90s of the last millennium.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples from this blog:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/10/20/aslr.html&#34;&gt;ASLR&lt;/a&gt;

: macOS Trend Micro Binary without ASLR, every exploit (yes, there are some)
automatically stable across the entire fleet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2018/06/18/websense-dlp-gives-instant-root.html&#34;&gt;Websense DLP gives instant root&lt;/a&gt;

:
WebSense DLP ships outdated software versions and an exploitable kernel module, probably missing QA and defective shipping process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is so widespread in endpoint security that, for example,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mastodon.social/@joxean&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;@joxean&lt;/a&gt;


has written an entire book about it:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/Antivirus-Hackers-Handbook-English-ebook/dp/B014MJ6AKS&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Antivirus Hacker&amp;rsquo;s Handbook&lt;/a&gt;

.
It describes how to find vulnerabilities of this kind in every – literally every – AV software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is systematic: It is due to the way this software is designed and developed, and it cannot be fixed with patches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this because I played this game for a few years with a company Mac:
I used the so-called &amp;ldquo;security tools&amp;rdquo; that Corp installed on my Mac to gain privileges on my Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole process is reliably repeatable, and I never had to invest more than a slow Friday afternoon in any case.
And I am not even a &amp;ldquo;security researcher,&amp;rdquo; just an amateur with reverse engineering experience from the C64 era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is this software, which is supposed to protect, ending up making the computer vulnerable.
When someone like Fefe talks about &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.fefe.de/?q=Schlangen&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;snake oil&lt;/a&gt;

, it is to be taken literally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/schlangenoel-05.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_oil&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Snake-Oil&lt;/a&gt;

 is a term used to describe deceptive marketing,
health care fraud, or a scam.
Similarly, snake oil salesman is a common label used to describe someone who sells, promotes,
or is a general proponent of some valueless or fraudulent cure, remedy, or solution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#a-list-of-problems-and-outdated-processes&#34;&gt;
	A List of Problems and Outdated Processes
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are talking about critically security-relevant software here,
which is supposed to prevent the intrusion of malware and attackers on computers,
or is supposed to detect such attacks, or has authentication or some other form of security-relevant function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It runs at critical points, often with privileges, and when it fails, it is not just one machine,
but often an entire company that is critically exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such software should be developed with tools and methods that are state-of-the-art
and undergo critical inspection with regard to correctness, freedom from errors, and currency of dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we see errors that suggest deficiencies in the development process at all points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are seeing critical errors that would not have to have major problematic impact
if the software had been written with minimal rights from the outset.
But running parsers for complex, unknown data formats that may contain potentially malicious payloads with privileges?
And then turning off elementary security mechanisms such as ASLR?
That means setting up for maximum damage.
It is not a winnable position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doing all this in 2024 in C, when Go or Rust could have been used? Not particularly smart either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packing your deliverables with software that, in the case of Ivanti, has been without patches for up to two decades?
Correct would be to have an automated release process that assembles a new release from the latest versions of everything
and tests it automatically.
What Ivanti delivers is not just &amp;ldquo;not state-of-the-art,&amp;rdquo; it is grossly negligent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delivering all this in an encrypted image, instead of with a &amp;ldquo;SBOM of Shame&amp;rdquo;
is soon to be a federal crime in the USA, and the EU is on the same path. Good.
(An SBOM is a Software Bill Of Materials, a list of the dependencies used and their versions.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &amp;ldquo;Format String Bug&amp;rdquo; or an &amp;ldquo;XML External Entities Vulnerability&amp;rdquo; are trivial errors that source code scanners can detect.
Such source scanners are being advertised by these security firms themselves or even developed in-house.
But these tools are not in use internally, because otherwise, such code could never have made it into a product.
This does not require AI; in part, these are better regular expressions, sometimes a bit of static analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As external observers, based on the demonstrated error patterns,
we are witnessing a failure along the entire software development chain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the architecture level (not minimizing rights),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at the tool level (no scanners for trivial errors, outdated dependencies, no automation in build and release),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at the packaging level (the defective permissions in Websense, for example),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and at every other point where one can infer the process from the errors observed from the outside.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, &amp;ldquo;no functioning code review and audit&amp;rdquo;
(&amp;ldquo;statically compiled-in backdoor passwords,&amp;rdquo; as are a persistent problem at Cisco, fall under this).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are thus management errors in the leadership of software companies that produce security-critical software.
It is the responsibility of management to establish and control processes that ensure a minimum level of quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion &amp;ldquo;software errors, nothing can be done about it&amp;rdquo; is incorrect –
there are entire classes of errors that can be definitively avoided through architecture,
automatic scanning,
education,
review,
and testing.
It is the responsibility of management to establish and control such processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, one can only conclude that irresponsible hack shops without fundamental software development processes
are masquerading as &amp;ldquo;security&amp;rdquo; companies.
They are packaging radioactive toxic waste in glossy packages,
thereby building a highway for nation-state actors into the heart of critical infrastructures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, the nature of the error borders on deliberate sabotage, or,
to put it another way, it could hardly be worse with deliberate sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;1010-no-notes&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#1010-no-notes&#34;&gt;
	10/10, no notes
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On IRC, my friends joke:
&amp;ldquo;Are you a 10/10 company?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security vulnerabilities are not only assigned a unique number, the CVE number,
but they also receive a severity grade,
the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerability_Scoring_System&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CVSS-Score&lt;/a&gt;

.
A 10/10 is the maximum grade, but basically, anything above 8 is considered
&lt;a href=&#34;https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;a total loss and complete process failure&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is now a historical CVE database that can be
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/cvssscoremin-9/cvssscoremax-10/vulnerabilities.html?page=1&amp;amp;cvssscoremin=9&amp;amp;cvssscoremax=10&amp;amp;order=3&amp;amp;trc=40515&amp;amp;sha=2721cbf47ba1e57d8b65ae1c3cf8883295fd04d7&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;sorted by CVSS score&lt;/a&gt;

,
and also narrowed down to companies like
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-3080/Fortinet.html?page=1&amp;amp;cvssscoremin=9&amp;amp;order=3&amp;amp;trc=103&amp;amp;sha=0ba96ce0b5ea0195196988ef1d381bdd33622c49&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Fortinet&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then see for Fortinet a series of 12 errors with a 10/10 rating,
specifically 2x in 2024, 1x in 2021, 1x in 2019, 3x in 2017, 4x in 2016, and once in 2005.
This can also be summarized as &amp;ldquo;no improvement is observable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Security is a process,&amp;rdquo; it is often said.
For Business Continuity Management, I once wrote down what that means:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/02/18/this-is-not-a-drill.html&#34;&gt;This is not a Drill. This is just Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar considerations can be made for secure software development processes,
and there are even ready-made process blueprints available for this purpose.
Furthermore, as I have shown, the patterns of errors can reveal the weaknesses in the internal development process
with regard to security best practices.
The numbers of CVEs and CVSS scores can indicate whether a company has improved its posture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it is apparent that this has not been the case over the years, how can a purchasing decision be made positively?
Something to think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some things can only be made bearable with cute guinea pig photos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This text also has a version in
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2024/02/10/snake-oil.html&#34;&gt;english language&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diese Woche war &amp;ldquo;Kaputte Security Software Werbewoche&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;fortigate-und-ivanti&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#fortigate-und-ivanti&#34;&gt;
	Fortigate und Ivanti
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zunächst einmal war &lt;strong&gt;heute&lt;/strong&gt; Fortigate Patchday:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/schlangenoel-01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CVE-2024-23113, CVSSV3 Score 9.8, Unauthorized Code Execution, &amp;ldquo;Format String Bug&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A use of &lt;a href=&#34;https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/134.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;externally-controlled format string&lt;/a&gt;

 vulnerability
in FortiOS &lt;code&gt;fgfmd&lt;/code&gt; daemon may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code or
commands via specially crafted requests.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist ein Fall, wo eine C-Funktion einen Formatstring mit &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;Bla %s Fasel&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; annimmt,
um etwa eine Log-Nachricht oder ein Kommando für einen &lt;code&gt;system()&lt;/code&gt; Aufruf zusammenzubauen.
Der Entwickler hat jedoch den Format-Parameter des Kommandos nicht statisch auf einen Formatstring gesetzt
(&lt;code&gt;snprintf(buffer, length, &amp;quot;Bla %s Fasel&amp;quot;, benutzereingabe)&lt;/code&gt;),
sondern stattdessen die Benutzereingabe als Format genommen
(&lt;code&gt;snprintf(buffer, length, benutzereingabe)&lt;/code&gt;).
Die Benutzereingabe kann so verwendet werden, um alles Mögliche zu tun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist ein Fehler, der von den üblichen Sourcecodescannern automatisch erkannt wird,
und wenn man in einer modernen Entwicklungsumgebung versucht, so etwas zu comitten oder zu mergen,
dann wird man vom Scanner ganz furchtbar erniedrigt, der Commit zurückgewiesen und man bekommt ein Security-Training zugewiesen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will sagen, dieser Fehler tritt in einer zeitgemäßen Development-Umgebung nicht mehr auf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Auch gestern&lt;/strong&gt; war Fortigate Patchday:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/schlangenoel-02.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CVE-2024-21762, CVSSV3 Score 9.6, Unauthorized Code Execution, &amp;ldquo;Out of Bounds Write&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A &lt;a href=&#34;https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;out-of-bounds write&lt;/a&gt;

 vulnerability
in FortiOS may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code or command via specially crafted HTTP requests.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist ein Fehler, der in C oder anderen Sprachen ohne Indexprüfung beim Zugriff auf Arrays gerne gemacht wird.
In C kann man zum Beispiel mit negativen Indices auf Speicher vor dem Array zugreifen, und
wenn ein Error-Code &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt; ist, aber nach einem Funktionsaufruf der Error-Code nicht geprüft wird,
dann brennt alles nieder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diese Sorte Fehler wird von Source Code Scannern mit statischem Analyzer nicht immer gefunden,
aber meistens und alle Fälle, wo das nicht passiert, sollten von dem Ding eigentlich als Code Smell angemerkt werden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nun. Leider war &lt;strong&gt;auch vorgestern&lt;/strong&gt; Fortigate Patchday.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fortinet-warns-of-new-fortisiem-rce-bugs-in-confusing-disclosure/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;BleepingComputer schreibt&lt;/a&gt;

:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this instance, due to an issue with the API which we are currently investigating,
rather than an edit, this resulted in two new CVEs being created, duplicates of the original CVE-2023-34992,
FortiNet told BleepingComputer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it turns out that CVE-2024-23108 and CVE-2024-23109 are actually patch bypasses for the CVE-2023-34992
flaw discovered by Horizon3 vulnerability expert Zach Hanley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das war also ein Patch für einen Patch, weil die Mitigation nicht funktioniert hat und
Fortinet kam mit den CVE-Nummern durcheinander, weil gerade so viele davon offen sind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unterdessen fordert die US CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) von allen US-Institutionen das
Abschalten von Ivanti VPN (vormals Juniper Pulse Secure):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/schlangenoel-03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;CISA is requiring all Federal agencies to disconnect Ivanti products by Friday at midnight
(Ivanti Connect Secure &amp;amp; Ivanti Policy Secure).
This is roughly 48-hours notice, to not patch, but rip it out!
Ivanti is an American company.
This is unprecedented.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Während man
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/supplemental-direction-v1-ed-24-01-mitigate-ivanti-connect-secure-and-ivanti-policy-secure&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;die Originaldirektive&lt;/a&gt;


ursprünglich noch als Update und Reinstallation sowie Neukonfiguration lesen konnte
hat sich diese Hoffnung mittlerweile zerschlagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Patches, von denen dort die Rede ist, sind nicht geeignet, den Fehler zu beheben.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://infosec.exchange/@briankrebs/111863433959430768&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Brian Krebs hat das zusammengefasst&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unterdessen hat jemand das Ivanti Image mal aufgemacht und reingesehen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/schlangenoel-04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Versionen von Software, die routinemäßig seit mehr als einer Dekade veraltet sind in einem aktuellen Image.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das sind, wie curl-Entwickler Stefan Eissing formuliert &amp;ldquo;Leichenteile und Zombie Software&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Und, es kommt, wie es kommen muss:
Einige Tage nach der von CISA vorgeschriebenen Patchorgie
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ivanti-patch-new-connect-secure-auth-bypass-bug-immediately/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;titelt BleepingComputer erneut&lt;/a&gt;

:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ivanti: Patch new Connect Secure auth bypass bug immediately&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flaw (CVE-2024-22024) is due to an XXE
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;XML eXternal Entities&lt;/a&gt;

) weakness in the gateways&amp;rsquo; SAML component
that lets remote attackers gain access to restricted resources on unpatched appliances in low-complexity
attacks without requiring user interaction or authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAML, Security Assertion Markup Language, ist eine XML-Notation für Zugriffsrechte in Single-Sign-On Systemen.
Weil es eine XML-Notation ist, kann es dort diese &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;blablub;&lt;/code&gt;-Dinger geben – Entities – die durch anderen Text ersetzt werden.
Bei External Entities liegt der Ersetzungstext nicht lokal fest, sondern wird aus dem Netz nachgeladen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was heißt das im Kontext von SAML? Es bedeutet, die Zugriffsrechte sind im Dokument also nicht zwingend festgenagelt,
sondern ein Angreifer kann Entity Definitionen aus dem Netz nachladen.
Je nachdem, wo die Entity verwendet wird, kann man damit die SAML-Datei in Teilen oder ganz umschreiben und sich andere Rechte geben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XML-Parser sind gut verstanden und XEE sind ein Ding, auf das man mit einem Sourcecode-Scanner zuverlässig automatisch scannen kann.
Diese Sorte Fehler ist in modernen Entwicklungsumgebungen gut auszuschließen.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist alles keine Ausnahme und auch nicht auf VPN-Gateways beschränkt,
sondern Hersteller von Security Software setzen fröhlich auf
&amp;ldquo;Security-Relevante Software mit Privilegien, und Programmiermethoden aus den 90er Jahren des letzten Jahrtausends&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beispiele aus diesem Blog:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/10/20/aslr.html&#34;&gt;ASLR&lt;/a&gt;

: MacOS Trend Micro Binary mit ohne ASLR, jeder Exploit
(ja, es gibt welche) ist automatisch stabil über die ganze Flotte.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2018/06/18/websense-dlp-gives-instant-root.html&#34;&gt;Websense DLP gives instant root&lt;/a&gt;

:
WebSense DLP veraltete Softwareversionen und exploitbares Kernelmodul, vermutlich fehlende QA und defekter Shipping Prozess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist bei Endpoint Security so verbreitet, daß zum Beispiel
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mastodon.social/@joxean&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;@joxean&lt;/a&gt;

 ein ganzes Buch darüber geschrieben hat:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/Antivirus-Hackers-Handbook-English-ebook/dp/B014MJ6AKS&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Antivirus Hacker&amp;rsquo;s Handbook&lt;/a&gt;

.
beschreibt, wie man Sicherheitslücken dieser Art in jeder, wirklich jeder AV Software findet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist systematisch:
Es liegt an der der Art und Weise, wie diese Software designt und entwickelt wird,
und es ist auch mit Patchs nicht zu beheben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ich weiß das, weil ich dieses Spiel einige Jahre mit einem Firmen-Mac gespielt habe:
Ich habe die sogenannten &amp;ldquo;Security Tools&amp;rdquo; verwendet, die Corp auf meinem Mac installiert, um auf meinem Mac Privilegien zu bekommen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der ganze Prozess ist zuverlässig wiederholbar,
und ich habe in keinem Fall mehr als einen langsamen Freitagnachmittag dafür investieren müssen.
Dabei bin ich noch nicht einmal &amp;ldquo;Security-Researcher&amp;rdquo;,
sondern nur ein Amateur mit Reverse-Engineering Erfahrung aus dem C64-Zeitalter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es ist diese Software, die angeblich schützen soll, die am Ende dazu führt, daß der Rechner angreifbar wird.
Wenn jemand wie Fefe von &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.fefe.de/?q=Schlangen&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Schlangenöl&lt;/a&gt;

 redet, dann ist das wortwörtlich zu verstehen.&lt;/p&gt;

 is a term used to describe deceptive marketing,
health care fraud, or a scam.
Similarly, snake oil salesman is a common label used to describe someone who sells, promotes,
or is a general proponent of some valueless or fraudulent cure, remedy, or solution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Eine Problemliste und veraltete Prozesse
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir reden hier von kritisch security-relevanter Software,
die das Eindringen von Schadsoftware und Angreifern auf Rechnern verhindern soll,
oder die solche Angriffe erkennen soll,
oder die Authentisierung oder sonst eine Form von sicherheitsrelevanter Funktion hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sie läuft an kritischer Stelle, oft mit Privilegien und wenn sie versagt, ist meist nicht nur eine Maschine,
sondern eine ganze Firma kritisch exponiert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solche Software sollte eigentlich mit Werkzeugen und Methoden, die Stand der Technik sind, entwickelt werden
und besonderer Beobachtung hinsichtlich Korrektheit, Fehlerfreiheit und Aktualität von Dependencies unterliegen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir sehen jedoch Fehler, die auf Defizite im Entwicklungsprozeß an allen Stellen schließen lassen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wir sehen kritische Fehler, die keine groß problematischen Auswirkungen haben müßten,
wenn die Software von vorher herein rechteminimal geschrieben worden wäre.
Aber Parser für komplexe, unbekannte Datenformate, die potenziell bösartige Payloads enthalten,
mit Privilegien laufen zu lassen?
Und dann noch elementare Sicherheitsmechanismen des Betriebssystems abschalten?
Das bedeutet, sich für Maximalschaden aufzustellen.
Es ist keine gewinnbare Position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Das alles in 2024 in C zu tun, wenn man Go oder Rust zur Verfügung hätte?
Auch nicht sonderlich schlau.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seine Deliverables mit Software vollzupacken, die im Fall von Ivanti bis zu zwei Dekaden
ohne Patches auf dem Buckel hat, anstatt einen automatisierten Release-Prozess zu haben, der ein neues
Release aus den neusten Versionen von allem zusammenschraubt und automatisch testet?
Das ist nicht nur &amp;ldquo;nicht Stand der Technik&amp;rdquo;, sondern es ist grob fahrlässig.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Das alles dann in einem verschlüsselten Image auszuliefern, statt mit einer &amp;ldquo;SBOM of Shame&amp;rdquo;
(Software Bill Of Materials, eine Liste der verwendeten Dependencies und ihrer Versionen)
ist bald schon ein Federal Crime in den USA, und auch die EU ist auf diesem Weg.
Gut so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ein &amp;ldquo;Format String Bug&amp;rdquo; oder eine &amp;ldquo;XML External Entities Vulnerability&amp;rdquo; sind triviale Fehler,
die Source Code Scanner erkennen können, wie sie von diesen Securityfirmen selbst beworben
oder gar im eigenen Haus entwickelt werden.
Aber offensichtlich sind diese Werkzeuge im Hause nicht im Einsatz, denn sonst hätte solcher Code niemals in
ein Produkt gelangen können.
Dazu braucht es keine KI, teilweise sind das bessere Regular Expressions, manchmal ein bisschen statische Analyse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir beobachten hier als Außenstehende auf der Grundlage der gezeigten Fehlerbilder ein
Versagen entlang der gesamten Software Development Chain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auf der Architektur-Ebene (nicht rechteminimal),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;auf der Tool-Ebene (keine Scanner für triviale Fehler, veraltete Dependencies, keine Automation beim Build und Release)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;auf der Packaging-Ebene (die defekten Permissions bei Websense zum Beispiel)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;und an jeder anderen Stelle, bei der man von außen durch die Fehler auf den Prozess rückschließen kann.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zum Beispiel &amp;ldquo;kein funktionierender Code-Review und Audit&amp;rdquo;
(&amp;ldquo;statisch einkompilierte Backdoor-Passworte&amp;rdquo;, wie sie bei Cisco das Dauer-Fehlerbild sind, fallen darunter).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es sind mithin Managementfehler bei der Führung von Software-Häusern, die sicherheitskritische Software herstellen.
Es ist Aufgabe des Managements Prozesse einzurichten und zu steuern, die ein Mindestmaß an Qualität sicherstellen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Softwarefehler, kann man nichts machen&amp;rdquo; stimmt so nicht – es gibt ganze Klassen von Fehlern,
die man durch Architektur,
durch automatisches Scannen,
durch Ausbildung,
durch Review,
und durch Testen sicher ausschließen kann,
und es ist die Aufgabe des Managements, solche Prozesse einzurichten und zu steuern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alles in allem kann man nur zu dem Ergebnis kommen,
daß hier verantwortungslose Hackerbuden ohne elementare Software-Entwicklungsprozesse als &amp;ldquo;Security&amp;rdquo;-Firmen auftreten
und radioaktiven Giftmüll in Hochglanzpackungen abfüllen,
um so eine Autobahn für Nation State Actors ins Herz von kritischen Infrastrukturen zu bauen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teilweise grenzt die Art der Fehler an mutwillige Sabotage,
beziehungsweise könnte man es auch mit mutwilliger Sabotage kaum schlimmer machen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;1010-no-notes&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#1010-no-notes&#34;&gt;
	10/10, no notes
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Im Chat witzeln Freunde von mir:
&amp;ldquo;Are you a 10/10 company?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security-Lücken wird nicht nur eine eindeutige Nummer zugewiesen, die CVE-Nummer, sondern
sie bekommen auch einen Schweregrad, den &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerability_Scoring_System&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CVSS-Score&lt;/a&gt;

.
Eine 10/10 ist der Maximalgrad, aber im Grunde ist alles über 8
ein &lt;a href=&#34;https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Totalschaden und komplettes Prozessversagen&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es gibt nun eine historische CVE-Datenbank, die man
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/cvssscoremin-9/cvssscoremax-10/vulnerabilities.html?page=1&amp;amp;cvssscoremin=9&amp;amp;cvssscoremax=10&amp;amp;order=3&amp;amp;trc=40515&amp;amp;sha=2721cbf47ba1e57d8b65ae1c3cf8883295fd04d7&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;nach CVSS sortieren kann&lt;/a&gt;

,
und auch auf Firmen wie
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-3080/Fortinet.html?page=1&amp;amp;cvssscoremin=9&amp;amp;order=3&amp;amp;trc=103&amp;amp;sha=0ba96ce0b5ea0195196988ef1d381bdd33622c49&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Fortinet einschränken&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir sehen dann für Fortinet eine Reihe von 12 Fehlern mit 10/10, und zwar
2x in 2024, 1x in 2021, 1x in 2019, 3x in 2017, 4x in 2016 und einmal in 2005.
Das kann man auch mit &amp;ldquo;Besserung ist nicht erkennbar&amp;rdquo; zusammenfassen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Security ist ein Prozess&amp;rdquo; heißt es.
Für Business Continuity Management habe ich einmal aufgeschrieben, was das bedeutet:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/02/18/this-is-not-a-drill.html&#34;&gt;This is not a Drill. This is just Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analoge Überlegungen kann man auch für sichere Software-Entwicklungsprozesse anstellen,
und es gibt sogar fertige Prozess-Blueprints dafür.
Weiterhin kann man, wie ich gezeigt habe, an den Fehlerbildern erkennen, welche Schwächen der interne Entwicklungsprozess
hinsichtlich Security Best-Practices hat,
und an den CVE-Anzahlen und CVSS-Scores erkennen, ob eine Firma ihre Posture verbessert hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn das erkennbar über Jahre nicht der Fall ist, wie kann dann eine Kaufentscheidung positiv beschieden werden?
Denkt mal darüber nach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/meerschweinchen-anne.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manche Dinge sind nur durch niedliche Meerschweinchenfotos erträglich zu machen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wie ChatGPT funktioniert</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2024/02/06/wie-chatgpt-funktioniert.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2024 01:02:03 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2024/02/06/wie-chatgpt-funktioniert.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Es gibt einen wunderbaren Artikel von Stephen Wolfram,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;What Is ChatGPT Doing … and Why Does It Work?&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dies ist ein etwa ein Jahr alter und langer Text, und man muss dran bleiben, wenn man ihn verstehen möchte.
Er erklärt wie ChatGPT intern funktioniert, warum das so viel Ressourcen kostet,
und er erklärt auch, daß wir keine Ahnung haben, wieso das &amp;ldquo;funktioniert&amp;rdquo;.
Er zeigt aber auch, was ChatGPT alles prinzipbedingt niemals erreichen kann, und auch nicht lernen wird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;What is ChatGPT doing…&lt;/a&gt;


von Stephen Wolfram vom 14. Februar 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Wolfram ist ein Informatiker und Physiker,
der einen recht guten Prolog-Interpreter mit Regeln zur Termumformung und Fakten gefüttert hat,
und dies unter dem Namen Mathematica vertreibt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prolog ist eine deklarative Sprache, die vor 30 Jahren die Grundlage regelbasierter künstlicher Intelligenz-Forschung war.
Deklarative Sprachen wie SQL oder Prolog schreiben keine Programme, die dem Computer sagen, was zu tun ist,
sondern sie beschreiben das gewünschte Ergebnis.
Ein Programmgenerator, der Planer, versucht dann einen Ausführungspfad zu finden,
der das beschriebene Ergebnis auf eine effiziente Weise findet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Idee hinter diesem Ansatz in der KI-Forschung war, daß man die Welt regelbasiert beschreiben könnte,
ein Welt-Wissensmodell bauen und daß so &amp;ldquo;Intelligenz&amp;rdquo; entsteht.
Das war ein Fehlschlag, aber Mathematica ist eines der beeindruckendsten Arbeitssysteme für Mathematik,
Physik-Visualisierung und Modellierung und alle verwandten Arbeiten.
Eine private Lizenz ist teuer, aber ich gönne mir die,
weil es so einen Heidenspaß macht mit dem Ding zu arbeiten und Sachen auszuprobieren.
Rein optisch und von der Arbeitsweise ist Jupyter ein gnadenloser Mathematica-Clone,
aber in Mathematica steckt eine komplett andere Sprache (etwas, das mal ein Prolog war) und eine viel, viel größere Bibliothek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-02.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ein Mathematica Arbeitsblatt, das die Approximation von Rechteckwellen durch Fouriersynthese zeigt,
indem es eine Formelschar generiert und plotted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wir generieren daraus Audio, stellen das Audio dar, und spielen es ab.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wolfram geht in seinem Text auf einen der simpelsten Textgeneratoren ein (und zeigt, wie man ihn in Mathematica realisiert) –
ein Zeichenfrequenz-Zähler, der Wikipedia-Seiten konsumiert und zeigt,
wie oft (normiert, also in %) jeder Buchstabe in der Seite auftaucht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Er vergleicht die Seiten von &amp;ldquo;Cat&amp;rdquo; und &amp;ldquo;Dog&amp;rdquo; und zeigt, daß in der &amp;ldquo;Dog&amp;rdquo;-Seite natürlich die o-Wahrscheinlichkeit höher ist,
aber daß beide für Englisch charakteristische Buchstabenhäufigkeiten haben.
Er greift sich dann die Häufigkeiten von Buchstabenpaaren (Bi-Grammen) und zeigt an der Spalte für den Buchstaben &amp;ldquo;q&amp;rdquo;,
daß &amp;ldquo;q&amp;rdquo; quasi immer von &amp;ldquo;u&amp;rdquo; gefolgt wird, und man kann das sehen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entlang der X-Achse die ersten Buchstaben von Paaren,
entlang der Y-Achse die zweiten Buchstaben.
Je roter und dunkler das Feld, umso häufiger die Kombination.
Die Spalte &amp;ldquo;q&amp;rdquo; ist ganz weiß, mit Ausnahme der &amp;ldquo;qu&amp;rdquo;-Kombination.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nimmt man mehr Kontext, also statt Paaren Dreiergruppen (Tri-Gramme) oder noch längere Gruppen,
dann bekommt man irgendwann fast aussprechbare oder reale englische Worte.
Schon 4-Gramme produzieren gute Worte.
Englisch hat also einen Buchstabenkontext von circa 4-5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-05.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eine Reihe von Worten, die aus Nachfolgewahrscheinlichkeiten von Bi-, Tri- und n-Grammen erzeugt worden ist.
Ab einer Länge von etwa 4 entstehen oft gültige Worte der englischen Sprache.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Würde man das mit chinesischen Schriftzeichen machen,
bekäme man aus einem Grundwortschatz von einigen tausend Worten auf diese Weise Sätze.
Viele chinesische Begriffe haben ein Schriftzeichen, manche zur Klärung der Bedeutung zwei.
ChatGPT macht das genau so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dort sind es keine Schriftzeichen, sondern Token.
Aber ein Token entspricht ziemlich genau der Funktion, die ein Schriftzeichen in Chinesisch hat.
Und es sind fast genau so viele – in der Größenordnung von Zehntausenden.
Davon sind viele Begriffe Ein-Token und einige Mehr-Token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bigramme auf Token produzieren Dinge wie dies hier: Wortsalat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-06.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eine Reihe von Wortfolgen, die alle zufällig generiert wurden, auf der Basis von Wortfolgewahrscheinlichkeiten,
die über Bi-Grammen, also Wortpaaren, errechnet worden sind.
Alle Beispiel starten mit dem Wort &amp;ldquo;cat&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stellt man mehr Kontext, arbeitet man also mit n-Grammen für n=3, 4, …,
dann bekommt man eher Dinge, die wie korrekte Sätze aussehen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man bekommt auch eine kombinatorische Explosion:
Statt 26, 26*26, 26*26*26, &amp;hellip; Wahrscheinlichkeiten zum Abspeichern hat man jetzt zum Beispiel 40.000 als Basis.
Und bei einem großen Kontext – statt 4 oder 5 eher was bei 100 – hat man dann mit 40.000 hoch 100 zu tun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, nicht – weil man das so nicht verarbeiten kann,
und ein wenig Arbeit in die Speicherung von dünn besetzten Matrizen und große Datenmengen stecken muss.
Aber das ist ein lösbares Problem, auch wenn es Aufwand erfordert, der auf der Mathematik nicht sichtbar ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wolfram erklärt dann &amp;ldquo;Modellierung durch Interpolation&amp;rdquo;.
Er hat Messwerte, die den Weg eines geworfenen Balls durch den Raum beschreiben,
und will dann nacheinander eine Gerade, eine Parabel oder &amp;ldquo;was Kompliziertes&amp;rdquo; da hindurchlegen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Er nutzt dieses Beispiel, um viele Dinge um den Modellbegriff zu erklären:
Einmal gibt es verschiedene Wege, um den Fehler zu messen,
also die Abweichung der interpolierten Linie von den Messwerten zu beschreiben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-07.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Die Messwerte eines Ballwurfes, und die verschiedenen hindurch interpolierten Kurven.
Eine Gerade, eine Parabel und &amp;ldquo;was Kompliziertes&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dann setzt die &amp;ldquo;Beweglichkeit&amp;rdquo; der Funktion, die zur Interpolation genutzt wird, dem Modell Grenzen.
Egal, welche Koeffizienten man findet – die &amp;ldquo;komplizierte&amp;rdquo; Funktion aus dem letzten Beispiel hat immer große Fehler.
Sie kann keinen Fit ergeben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die zweite Funktion, die Parabel, ist immer ein guter Fit.
Das ist so, weil das real-weltliche Phänomen sich aus Gründen tatsächlich parabolisch verhält,
bis es durch Luftwiderstand gestört wird.
In jedem Modell stecken Annahmen – und die können, wenn sie falsch sind, – das Modell unmöglich machen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Er geht dann zu neuronalen Netzen über und diskutiert, wie diese aufgebaut sind,
und welche Mathematik da drin steckt und wofür man sie einsetzen kann.
Es sind Geradengleichungen, mx+b, und Summen, aber sehr, sehr viele.
Sein Beispiel ist die Schrifterkennung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-08.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ein Datentyp in Mathematica sind zweidimensionale Bitmaps – Bilder.
Hier sind es handgeschriebene Ziffern.
Man kann diese in eine Menge (einen weiteren Datentyp) tun, und dann einem NetModel (dem Datentyp für ein Neurales Netz) vorwerfen.
Dieses spezielle NetModel gibt dann als Ausgabe die erkannten Ziffern.
Dies ist eine Anwendung eines NN als Classifier, also als ein Ding, das erkennen und gruppieren kann.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-09.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Auf ein Bitmuster einer gut lesbaren 2 wird sukzessive ein immer stärkerer Gaussian Blur angewendet.
Die resultierende Eingabemenge wird in das NetModel-Objekt verfüttert und man bekommt &amp;ldquo;2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1&amp;rdquo; als Ausgabe.
Das Modell bricht bei schlechten Daten irgendwann zusammen.
Als Mensch erkennt man mehr Ziffern korrekt als 2, aber am Ende wird es wirklich sehr unlesbar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wolfram macht dann weiter und diskutiert das Konzept der Nähe oder Ähnlichkeit, indem er mit Voronoi-Maps herumexperimentiert.
Er stellt sich jetzt die Aufgabe, eine bestimmte Funktion mit zwei Parametern x und y, die die Werte -1, 0 und +1 liefert,
zu &amp;ldquo;lernen&amp;rdquo; und durch ein neuronales Netz zu produzieren.
Er benutzt das, um zu zeigen, wie man Koeffizienten einer Näherungsfunktion findet,
indem man simple Geradengleichungsrechner (Neuronen) verknüpft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-10.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Von einem NN erkannte handgeschriebene Ziffern nach Ähnlichkeit sortiert und angeordnet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-11.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eine Reihe von zufällig auf einer Ebene verteilte Punkte und die von ihnen &amp;ldquo;beherrschten&amp;rdquo; Gebiete:
Jeder Punkt der Ebene wird dem orangen Punkt zugeordnet, der ihm nach irgendeiner Distanzmetrik am nächsten ist.
Es entsteht eine Partition, eine Aufteilung, der Karte in Zonen um die Punkte.
Es sieht aus wie Seifenblasen, die aneinander kleben und gerade Schnittflächen bilden.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-12.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Die Aufgabe: Ein simples Voronoi, das drei Punkte mit den Werten +1, 0 und -1 auf einer Ebene verteilt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-13.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Die 3D-Darstellung desselben Diagramms.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Er nimmt dann die vorherigen Gedanken zur Interpolation wieder auf.
Dazu erfindet er ohne weitere Erläuterung eine Aneinanderreihung von &amp;ldquo;Neuronen&amp;rdquo;, schreibt Koeffizienten dran,
und diskutiert verschiedene mögliche Abstandsberechnungsfunktionen (Fehler-Meßfunktionen).
Wenn man die Mathematik und den Prozess der Suche nach den passenden Koeffizienten mal wegläßt,
kommt man am Ende bei einer Näherung des Wunsch-Graphen an, die so aussieht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-14.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Das von Wolfram gewählte neuronale Netz.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-16.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Das Resultat weicht vom Wunschergebnis ab, ist aber eine gute Näherung.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Er diskutiert und demonstriert dann durch Simulation, daß man bestimmte Dinge nicht darstellen kann,
wenn man nicht genügend Neuronen hat.
Das zu modellierende Subjekt ist zu kompliziert, sodaß der mögliche Parameterraum nicht groß genug ist:
Eine Gerade kann keine Parabel annähern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-16.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verschiedene NN und die resultierenden Näherungen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es geht dann in einen längeren Exkurs, in dem er die Anatomie der Netze zu erklären, die da verwendet werden.
Man erkennt, daß die Modelle Schichten haben und daß sie keine Rückflüsse haben:
Daten fließen immer von der oberen Schicht in die unmittelbar darunter liegende – es gibt keine Rückflüsse und auch kein Überspringen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man erkennt auch, daß generell größere Modelle bessere Ergebnisse liefern.
Wolfram gibt zu, daß wir nicht wissen, wie groß ein NN für ein bestimmtes Problem sein muss.
Wir wissen auch nicht, wie die konkrete Verschaltung der Schichten aussehen sollte,
oder muss, um gute Ergebnisse zu liefern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Er versucht immerhin, die Inhalte der Schichten zu verstehen und ihnen Bedeutung zuzuweisen,
aber auch das ist nicht wirklich Wissenschaft und teilweise Kaffeesatzlesen.
Fast alles am Bau von NN ist &amp;ldquo;Erfahrung&amp;rdquo; und &amp;ldquo;Empirik&amp;rdquo; ohne viel Theorie dahinter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir können Daten aus Schichten von NN herausziehen und sie nach einer Abstandsfunktion sortieren lassen,
und die Anordnung ergibt für unsere menschlichen Hirne irgendwie Sinn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-18.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hunde und Katzenbilder nach einer Abstandsfunktion eines NN sortiert.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir können auch die Neuronen einiger Schichten nehmen, die Koeffizienten in einer Bildmatrix anordnen,
und bekommen vereinfachte Bilder von den Dingen, die da gespeichert oder erkannt werden sollen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aber wir haben keine Funktionstheorie oder Mathematik von NN und Kognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-19.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aus einer Schicht aus dem NN eines Katzen-Hunde-Sortierers herausgezogene Daten ergeben Katzenbilder.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wolfram beschäftigt sich weiter mit dem Training von NN, der Datenbeschaffung und der Auszeichnung von Daten.
Das Korpus von Trainingsdaten muss groß und zuverlässig ausgezeichnet sein.
Wir brauchen also viele Katzenbilder (Dafür gibt es das Internet!) und Hundebilder,
und diese müssen von Menschen korrekt mit Tags versehen worden sein, damit ein NN das lernen kann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Er zeigt dann Verbesserungen der Koeffizienten und der Resultate über Iterationen des Lernprozesses.
&amp;ldquo;Lernen&amp;rdquo; bedeutet für ein NN, die Koeffizienten der verschiedenen Neuronen zu verändern.
Dazu nimmt man die Eingabe-Koeffizienten als &amp;ldquo;Ebene&amp;rdquo; und den Fehler als &amp;ldquo;Höhe&amp;rdquo;
und wandert dann in der so entstehenden Fehlerlandschaft auf einem zufälligen Pfad in die Täler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das findet lokale Minima und man hofft, aus &amp;ldquo;lokalen Löchern&amp;rdquo; zu entkommen, indem man zufällige Schritte zufälliger Größen macht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-20.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Die Berg- und Tallandschaft des Fehlergraphen und der Weg des Modells zum lokalen Minimum.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wieder diskutiert Wolfram mögliche Layouts von NN –
nicht immer kann man jedes Neuron mit allen Neuronen der nächsten Lage verschalten und in der Tat ist das bei großen NN nie machbar.
Bestimmte Formen haben sich als besser lernfähig erwiesen:
Ein schmaler Layer der zwischen zwei breite Layers eingefügt wird scheint Ergebnisse stark zu verbessern.
Niemand weiß, warum das so ist oder hat ein Modell, das dies erklärt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-21.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verschiedene Formen von NN und die Ergebnisse, die sie produzieren.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Etwa in der Mitte des Textes wendet sich Wolfram generativen Modellen und LLMs zu.
Training von LLMs ist sehr, sehr einfach, weil sie einfach Text essen:
Man nimmt beliebigen Text, lässt das Modell das folgende Wort generieren und vergleicht es mit dem Wort, das hätte kommen müssen.
Daraus kann man Trainingsfeedback erzeugen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-22.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eine Karte, auf der englische Worte nach Ähnlichkeit angeordnet sind.
Säugetiere sind links oben, links unten sind &amp;ldquo;alligator&amp;rdquo; und &amp;ldquo;crocodile&amp;rdquo; dicht beieinander, &amp;ldquo;ant&amp;rdquo; und &amp;ldquo;bee&amp;rdquo; sind es auch.
Rechts unten Früchte.
Tiere und Früchte sind klar durch einen Graben getrennt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es entsteht dadurch sogar so etwas wie eine Wissens-Karte nach Ähnlichkeits-Metriken.
Das ist nicht so, weil das LLM ein Weltmodell hat.
Sondern es ist so, weil Menschen ein Weltmodell haben und wenn sie Worte gebrauchen,
bestimmte Worte &amp;ldquo;nach beieinander&amp;rdquo; in Sätzen angeordnet sind.
Ein Weltverständnis entsteht so nicht, ein gewisses Sprachverständnis wohl schon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wieder und wieder und wieder versucht Wolfram zu einem Verständnis der Koeffizienten von LLMs oder NNs zu kommen,
oder zu irgendeiner Theorie, die die Funktionsweise von LLMs und NNs planbar und vorhersagbar macht und sich über pure Empirik erhebt.
Er macht dies mit verschiedenen Visualisierungen von Koeffizienten auf die unterschiedlichsten Weisen,
aber er findet nur quälende Muster, die wie Inhalt wirken und nichts enthüllen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-23.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eine Vergröberung einer ChatGPT Koeffizientenmatrix und Einfärbung nach bestimmten Werten erzeugt eine interessante Teal-and-Orange Batik,
die nichts bedeutet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am Ende geht es dann darum,
wie man mit solchen riesigen Koeffizienten-Matrizen und einem austrainierten Modell generativ arbeitet und &amp;ldquo;interessante&amp;rdquo; Texte erzeugt.
Dabei geht es auch um den Parameter der &amp;ldquo;Temperatur&amp;rdquo; und den &amp;ldquo;Seed&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Würde man ein generatives LLM mit einer Null-Temperatur laufen lassen,
würde es immer dasselbe, wahrscheinlichste Folgetoken wählen, um einen Satz zu komplettieren.
Indem man die Wahrscheinlichkeiten der Folgetoken sortiert,
und dann zufällig ein anderes wahrscheinliches Token wählt, bekommt man immer noch &amp;ldquo;gültige&amp;rdquo; Fortsetzungen, die aber variabel sind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das Seed ist dabei der Startwert des Pseudo-Zufallszahlen-Generators,
die Temperatur die &amp;ldquo;Sprungweite&amp;rdquo; vom wahrscheinlichsten Wert weg.
Auch hierzu gibt es keine Theorie, wir wissen nur, daß &amp;ldquo;0.8 ein guter Wert ist&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wolfram schließt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So … What Is ChatGPT Doing, and Why Does It Work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic concept of ChatGPT is at some level rather simple.
Start from a huge sample of human-created text from the web, books, etc.
Then train a neural net to generate text that’s “like this.”
And in particular, make it able to start from a “prompt” and then continue with text that’s “like what it’s been trained with”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we’ve seen, the actual neural net in ChatGPT is made up of very simple elements — though billions of them.
And the basic operation of the neural net is also very simple, consisting essentially
of passing input derived from the text it’s generated so far “once through its elements” (without any loops, etc.)
for every new word (or part of a word) that it generates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the remarkable—and unexpected—thing is that this process can produce text that’s successfully “like” what’s out there on the web,
in books, etc.
And not only is it coherent human language, it also “says things” that “follow its prompt” making use of content it’s “read”.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t always say things that “globally make sense”
(or correspond to correct computations because it’s just saying things that “sound right” based on what things “sounded like” in its training material).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist der Stochastische Papagei, von dem bei LLMs gerne mal die Rede ist.
Er ist wortwörtlich gemeint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein LLM reproduziert Versatzstücke aus Texten, die es verarbeitet hat,
auf der Basis von Auftretenswahrscheinlichkeiten von &amp;ldquo;großes n&amp;rdquo;-Grammen von chinesischen Schriftzeichen (&amp;ldquo;Token&amp;rdquo;).
n ist dabei gerne groß zweistellig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein Konzept von Korrektheit gibt es nicht.
Wir wissen auch nicht, wie es das geben kann, denn es gibt keine Theorie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Idee, daß ein LLM in &amp;ldquo;full autopilot&amp;rdquo; Mode irgendwas Funktionales in irgendeiner Gesellschaft leisten kann – Arbeiten kann – ist lächerlich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Es reproduziert und würfelt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Es hat kein Weltmodell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Es kennt keine Grenzen in den Termen von Ethik, Moral, Physik oder Logik.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Es reiht nur Token aneinander.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein LLM kann Menschen Arbeit abnehmen, indem es bestimmte Standardfunktionen erleichtert,
und es ist wahrscheinlich ein ausgezeichneter Sprachübersetzer,
und sicher ein wunderbarer Imitator, denn das ist, als was es konstruiert ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aber Imitation schafft nicht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Redewendung des &amp;ldquo;Blurry JPEG of the Internet&amp;rdquo; ist wieder exakt zutreffend,
denn das ist, was der Konstruktionsprozeß eines LLM produziert – eine verlustbehaftete Kompression von Wort-Folge-Wahrscheinlichkeiten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In meiner beruflichen Karriere habe ich um mich herum eine Reihe von KI-Projekten in kommerzieller Anwendung gelingen und scheitern sehen.
Das Muster, daß sich dabei ergeben hat, bestätigt sich auch bei LLMs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wann immer meine Arbeitgeber KI eingesetzt haben, um Menschen full-auto zu ersetzen ist das Projekt ein unmitigiertes Desaster gewesen,
das der Firma geschadet und den Kunden Leid zugefügt hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wann immer meine Arbeitgeber KI eingesetzt haben um Menschen zu augmentieren war das Projekt eine Effizienzsteigerung
um eine halbe Größenordnung (den Faktor 3-5), die durch Feedback menschlicher Entscheidungen in den Trainingskorpus noch verbessert werden konnte.
Dabei war oft entscheidend, Confidence-Werte (aus der Modell-Fehler-Metrik abgeleitete Werte) herauszuführen und für Menschen sichtbar zu machen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Grundidee dahinter ist, daß wir eine Maschine bauen, die wir zwingen eine Entscheidung zu treffen, egal wie groß die Fehlermetrik ist.
Wenn die Maschine sich sicher ist, daß ein Standardfall in einer oder ander Weise vorliegt, ist das wahrscheinlich gut.
Wenn die Maschine aber eine hohe Fehlermetrik anzeigt, dann erzwingen wir eine Entscheidung, die wahrscheinlich zufällig ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hier ist es gut, den Fall herauszunehmen und Menschen vorzulegen.
Anders als die KI haben diese ein Weltmodell, und insbesondere ein Modell der ganzen Welt inklusive all der Informationsquellen,
Kontexte und Eskalationsstufen, die dem KI-Modell nicht zugänglich sind.
Menschen können Dinge auf Weisen kontextualisieren und umordnen, die einem Reproduktions-Papagei nicht möglich sind.
Und diese Menschen sind glücklicher, schneller und effektiver, wenn sie mit den Standardfällen nichts zu tun haben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir können KI erfolgreich einsetzen, wenn wir es nach diesem Modell tun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir können die Hölle auf Erden erschaffen, indem wir Menschen einer unkontrollierten Papagei-KI aussetzen,
die nach zufällig aufgerufenen Reproduktionen vorheriger Fälle entscheidet, ohne Ausweg.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Invalid-UTF8 vs the filesystem</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/09/14/invalid-utf8-vs-the-filesystem.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 14 Sep 2023 01:02:03 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/09/14/invalid-utf8-vs-the-filesystem.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A UNIX filename can contain arbitrary bytes in an arbitrary sequence, with two exceptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It cannot contain NUL (&lt;code&gt;\0&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It cannot contain slash (&lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;), because that is the directory separator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But will all filesystems accept such filenames?
And how will this work with languages such as Python, which require all strings to be valid &lt;code&gt;utf-8&lt;/code&gt; and
which declare the filesystem interface to accept and return strings?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-test-program&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#a-test-program&#34;&gt;
	A test program
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s check.
Here is a small C program, based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1301402/example-invalid-utf8-string&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this stackoverflow article&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;xfs&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#xfs&#34;&gt;
	XFS
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When running this on a Linux system with XFS, this works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/09/invalid-utf8-xfs.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The program runs and generates all files. Even those with byte sequences that are not valid utf-8.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works the same with ext4 on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zfs&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#zfs&#34;&gt;
	ZFS
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When running this on a Linux system with ZFS, filenames containing invalid utf-8 sequences are rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/09/invalid-utf8-zfs.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The program runs and generates files with valid utf-8 names. The &lt;code&gt;open(2)&lt;/code&gt; syscall fails for names with invalid utf-8 filenames.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;apfs&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#apfs&#34;&gt;
	APFS
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When running this on a MacOS Ventura system with APFS, filenames containing invalid utf-8 sequences are rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/09/invalid-utf8-apfs.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The program runs and generates files with valid utf-8 names. The &lt;code&gt;open(2)&lt;/code&gt; syscall fails for names with invalid utf-8 filenames.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#unpacking-invalid-utf-8-filenames-with-python&#34;&gt;
	Unpacking invalid utf-8 filenames with Python
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went and creates a &lt;code&gt;tar&lt;/code&gt; archive of the files generated on XFS and copied it over to my Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following test program was used to unpack the &lt;code&gt;tar&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ch&#34;&gt;#! /usr/bin/env python&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It probably is useful to restrict POSIX further and demand that filenames are always valid utf-8.
But that is not what the standard currently says, and also not what all filesystems guarantee.
And it can lead to unexpected behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, some programming languages such as Python demand of strings that they have valid utf-8 encoding,
but use filenames and strings equivalently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That can lead to weird behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently there is a function
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.getfilesystemencoding&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sys.getfilesystemencoding()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;


without parameters.
Python seems to assume that all filesystems have the same encoding and that it is not path dependent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently there are &lt;code&gt;os.fsencode()&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.fsencode&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;os.fsdecode()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are using &lt;code&gt;os.fsencode()&lt;/code&gt; to get &lt;code&gt;bytes&lt;/code&gt; from the filesystem interface.
We are then using &lt;code&gt;chardet.detect()&lt;/code&gt; on this byte-string and check the guesses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Aug 2023 01:02:03 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/08/28/der-admin-beruf.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;(based on a series of posts on Mastdon)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.heise.de/hintergrund/Gehaelter-2023-Das-verdienen-Admins-in-Deutschland-9282686.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ein Heise-Artikel über Admin-Gehälter&lt;/a&gt;


und ich schrieb dazu auf Mastodon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;ein-hoffentlich-aussterbender-beruf&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#ein-hoffentlich-aussterbender-beruf&#34;&gt;
	Ein hoffentlich aussterbender Beruf
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Beruf des &amp;ldquo;Admins&amp;rdquo; ist - hoffentlich - eine aussterbende Tätigkeit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Er wird zunehmend ersetzt durch die Kombination von &lt;em&gt;Infrastrukturentwicklung&lt;/em&gt; und &lt;em&gt;Support&lt;/em&gt;.
Infrastrukturentwicklung befasst sich dabei mit der Automatisierung von Provisionierung, Konfiguration, Betrieb, Überwachung und Aktualisierung.
Neben Kenntnissen über Betrieb sind auch Kenntnisse der Programmentwicklung notwendig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2015/03/27/go-away-or-i-will-replace-you.html&#34;&gt;Mehr zu Devops&lt;/a&gt;


in einem älteren Talk von mir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;betriebsprozesse-finden-und-durch-code-unterstützen&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#betriebsprozesse-finden-und-durch-code-unterst%c3%bctzen&#34;&gt;
	Betriebsprozesse finden und durch Code unterstützen
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Wert von Infrastrukturentwicklung bemisst sich dabei im Finden und Schaffen von operativen Prozessen,
die einen Dienst sicher in vorhersagbarer Qualität unterbrechungsfrei anbieten zu erlauben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das - der Wert und die Schwierigkeit von Operations - ist auch etwas, das von vielen Feature-Entwicklern und Software-Entwicklungsorganisationen weit unterschätzt wird.
Das ist einer der Gründe, wieso Amazon reich ist und Elastic oder HashiCorp im Vergleich eher nicht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auf eine Weise ist es auch der Grund warum viele deutsche Betriebe dem modernen DevOps Hipster skeptisch gegenüber stehen.
Man spürt, daß es mit dem Entwickeln, Day 1 Installation und Inbetriebnahme nicht getan ist.
Zugleich scheitert man an der Transferleistung, die Schaffung von Betriebsprozessen,
die aus der eigenen Produktion wohlbekannt ist, auf die IT auszudehnen und methodisch umzusetzen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Hälfte des Problems ist dabei das Unterschätzen der Schwierigkeit bzw fehlendes ernst nehmen der Aufgabenstellung.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#aws-bringt-struktur&#34;&gt;
	AWS bringt Struktur
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der &amp;ldquo;Wert&amp;rdquo; von Amazon besteht darin, dem Betrieb genau messbare Kosten und harte betriebliche Einschränkungen zu geben,
um die sich eine Firma nun auf einmal gezwungenermaßen herum organisieren muss,
während sie vorher unkontrolliert Druck auf interne Betriebsteams ausgeübt hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grenzen und Kosten, die vorher nicht fassbar waren, werden nun greifbar.
Firmen sind gezwungen, sich damit ernsthaft zu befassen.
Insofern ist Cloud eine gute Sache, weil sie Läden ins Meta zwingt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wie teuer ist &amp;ldquo;ein Admin-Team&amp;rdquo;?
So teuer wie Deine AWS Rechnung hoch wäre,
und die ist in den meisten Läden dreimal bis fünfmal höher als ursprünglich gedacht.
Das ist das Ausmaß des Understaffing in Operations in den meisten Firmen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heute Programmentwicklung, damals Perl.
Was hat sich jetzt genau geändert?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es gibt Perl und es gibt SysAdmin Perl.
Das ist im Grunde die Diskussion aus &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/01/05/using-python-to-bash.html&#34;&gt;Using Python to bash&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tobias Fiebig:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ich kann dir da nur zustimmen.
Ich denke, dass grad das end-to-end understanding verloren geht.
Und das ist halt über kurz oder lang gefährlich.
Denn ohne end-to-end understanding APIs nutzen geht wohl.
Aber Bauen eher nicht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist ein anderes, auch wichtiges Thema.
Ein Ex-Arbeitgeber von mir war in 2018 durchaus in der Lage, 3 RZ mit 50k Maschinen voll automatisiert zu betreiben und zu vernetzen.
Dieselbe Firma in 2023 ist dazu definitiv nicht mehr in der Lage, weil nach der Ankündigung des Cloud-Move
und den Änderungen im Management viele Leute weggegangen sind,
weil sie keine Zukunft mehr für sich gesehen haben.
Und weil Leute, die so etwas betreiben können, auch zunehmend schwieriger zu bekommen sind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;kubernetes-ist-zu-fett&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#kubernetes-ist-zu-fett&#34;&gt;
	Kubernetes ist zu fett?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juliane:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wobei ich aber auch behaupten würde, dass eine Kubernetes-Landschaft nicht immer die korrekte Lösung ist,
und es mutmasslich genug Betriebe gibt, die sowas haben, obwohl sie es besser nicht sollten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Überdimensionierte und dann tendenziell schlecht gepflegte Systeme sind für uns alle auch eine Gefahr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Da machst Du ein Fass auf.
Das TL;DR ist, daß Du zu große und zu wenige Maschinen hast und daher Technik zum Kleinschneiden von Servern brauchst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Und dann landest Du schnell bei Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die letzten Bare metal-Maschinen, mit denen ich gearbeitet habe, sind in etwa das Äquivalent von i3.4xl oder i3.8xl gewesen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Da waren &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/123547/intel-xeon-silver-4110-processor-11m-cache-2-10-ghz/specifications.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;zwei $400 CPUs drin&lt;/a&gt;

,
eine oder zwei 2 TB NVME und 10 Gbit Netz, sowie 128 GB in RAM.
Das war schon damals nicht mehr kosteneffektiv in dem Sinne, daß man lieber größere Kisten gekauft und klein gesägt hätte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das erzeugt zwei Probleme, eines für kleine Betriebe und eines für alle:
Du hast weniger Maschinen und in Folge weniger Racks.
Das heißt, ein Ausfall betrifft nicht mehr eine Anwendung, sondern viele oder alle.
Der Blast-Radius steigt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Da kann man was gegen tun:
Sich mit anderen zusammen tun und Anwendungen mischen.
Wenn dann eine Maschine oder ein Rack umfällt, dann betrifft das alle ein wenig, aber niemanden groß.
Das ist die Idee hinter Cloud – große shared Infrastruktur,
und Du belegst auf vielen Maschinen ein Fitzel statt auf einer Maschine alles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Und das zweite Problem:
Du hast jetzt viel mehr Komplexität, weil Du nicht nur Deine Anwendungen managen mußt,
sondern auch die enorm aufwendige Abstraktion darunter: Openstack oder Kubernetes.
Mit verteiltem Compute und Isolation von Anwendungen, verteiltem Storage und dessen Komplexitäten und mit einer Menge Netz.
Oder Du kaufst das fertig dazu von jemandem, der das für Dich betreibt – wieder landest Du in einer Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was Du nicht mehr tun kannst: Anwendungen lokal auf Rechnern betreiben, eine Anwendung pro Rechner.
Das geht deswegen nicht, weil Du keine Kisten mehr bekommst, die so klein sind, daß Du sie mit einer Anwendung voll bekommst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Du wirst Dich also gezwungenermaßen mit solchen Dingen auseinandersetzen müssen,
oder jemanden dazu nehmen müssen, der das für Dich tut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Openstack oder Kubernetes (oder das Äquivalent in einer Public Cloud) bringen eine Menge Komplexität mit,
aber es sind Standardprodukte, für die Du Leute finden und einstellen kannst.
Mit etwas Kleinerem, das nur die für Dich notwendigen Optionen hat, kannst Du das nicht, weil es kein Standardprodukt ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Behauptung ist, daß eine Reihe von finanziellen, strukturellen und demografischen Faktoren Dich als Unternehmen zwingen,
so viel als möglich in eine Cloud zu verlagern.
Das kann eine öffentliche Cloud oder eine private sein, aber Du kommst da nicht dran vorbei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;standardprodukte-helfen&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#standardprodukte-helfen&#34;&gt;
	Standardprodukte helfen
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thilo Fromm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kris spricht im zweiten Toot des Threads an, dass das Ziel Prozesse und SLAs sind.
Dafür muss man über technologische Notwendigkeiten (wie z.B. effizienten Betrieb) hinausgehen.
Die Erlernbarkeit und die Bekanntheit, die Verbreitung der eingesetzten Technologie und des Ökosystems zählen hier ebenso,
wie die Verfügbarkeit von Schulungen, Zertifizierungen, usw.
Das schafft enorme Erleichterung auf der Management-Ebene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Du tauschst also Performance gegen Betriebssicherheit:
Kubernetes macht es Dir im Vergleich zu &amp;ldquo;klassischer&amp;rdquo; Administration mehrerer Rechner
(Chef, Ansible, etc. kombiniert mit Fail-Over usw.) deutlich schwerer,
Dir in den eigenen Fuß zu schießen.
Denn es impliziert etablierte Pattern, die oft aus Erfahrungen aus dem &amp;ldquo;klassischen&amp;rdquo; Betrieb stammen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zudem kommt das Ökosystem als Komplettpaket mit einer großen Entwickler- und Nutzer-Community, was das Staffing erleichtert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Lernkurve bei der Übernahme bestehender Systeme ist niedriger als bei handgestrickten Lösungen,
und standardisierte Zertifizierungen erleichtern Dir das Anstellen neuer Mitarbeiter.
Dafür bezahlst Du dann mit Rechenressourcen, aber das ist für viele Betreiber eben der weitaus geringere Kostenfaktor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ich vergleiche Kubernetes und die (oft subjektive) Skepsis, die dem entgegenschlägt,
gern mit der steigenden Popularität von Java in der Applikationsentwicklung vor ~20 Jahren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java löst auch kein allein technisches Problem - Objektorientierung gab es schon vorher,
portable Software und managed code auch.
Es kommt mit Infrastruktur und einem Ökosystem, das über die reine Applikationsentwicklung hinaus geht:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Du konntest mit Java einen arbeitslosen Physiker von der Straße holen, durch ein paar Kurse schleusen, und nach ein paar Monaten war der produktiv.
Das ging davor nicht.
Die ermöglichte Applikationsentwicklung in Firmen und Organisationen, die vorher dazu nicht in der Lage waren.
So ist das mit Kubernetes in der Infrastrukturautomatisierung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natürlich gibt es dadurch nun Randfälle,
die aufgrund des niederschwelligen Einstiegslevels komplett neben der Spur laufen.
Aber sich allein auf diese Totalausfälle zu konzentrieren &amp;ndash; oder
zu ignorieren, dass Kubernetes ein weitgehend nicht-technisches Problem löst &amp;ndash; verfehlt
meiner Meinung nach den Punkt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;kubernetes-ist-nicht-komplex-das-problem-ist-es&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#kubernetes-ist-nicht-komplex-das-problem-ist-es&#34;&gt;
	Kubernetes ist nicht komplex, das Problem ist es
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sören entgegnet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;der Vergleich hinkt, finde ich. Die Kritik an Kubernetes ist nicht, dass es kein Fortschritt ist. Das ist es in einigen Szenarien.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Kritik ist, dass du dir eine komplexe Architektur an Containern aufbaust,
die du häufig auch mit weniger Wartungsaufwand und weniger laufenden Infrastrukturkosten auf einem physischen System hinbekommen hättest.
Klar, die sind jetzt individuell skalierbarer, aber damit löst du ein häufig rein hypothetisches Problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Als Antwort und Ergänzung zu Thilo Fromm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes löst einen Satz spezifische Probleme, und die Komplexität kommt aus den Problemen und nicht aus den Lösungen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Du willst eine sehr große Kiste in benutzbare Häppchen klein schneiden.
Das kannst Du mit Virtualisierung (Openstack) oder mit Containern (K8s) machen, aber für den Outcome ist es hinsichtlich der Komplexität egal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das Erste zu lösende Problem ist die Installation von Anwendungen und deren rückstandsfreie Entfernung.
Du bekommst Images:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn Du die nicht hast, mußt Du gezwungenermaßen einen 250k Files, 10 GB Size großen Linux-Tree an die Stelle kopieren, wo Deine Anwendung sitzt,
zusammen mit den Binaries, Configdateien und Daten der Anwendung.
Das dauert lange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn Du ein Image oder eine Sequenz von Images (&amp;ldquo;Docker Layers&amp;rdquo;) hast,
kannst Du die mit Disk Speed (400 MB/s) an Ort und Stelle kopieren und hast einen Loop Mount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das eskaliert schnell:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;root@server:~# df -Th | wc -l
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;71
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Die Images willst Du irgendwo zentral bereithalten und abrufen können,
also hast Du eine oder zwei Registries.
Ob die nun Glance, Docker-Registry oder Artifactory heißen ist am Ende egal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dein Image läuft nun auf diesem Host oder jenem, wo gerade Platz ist.
Das zieht weitere Dinge nach sich:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wo kommt der Storage her?
Entweder lokal, dann hast Du eine Scheduling-Constraint und Du kannst nur noch &lt;em&gt;hier&lt;/em&gt; laufen und nicht mehr &lt;em&gt;dort&lt;/em&gt;, oder aus dem Netz.
Oder Du hast einen Filer, iSCSI oder NVMEoF, und Volume Management.
Das kann Cinder heißen, oder CSI mit PVC/PV, auch das ist am Ende egal.
Du brauchst jedenfalls was, das Volumes durch Dein Netz an die Anwendung kabelt, egal wo die ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Und apropos &amp;ldquo;egal wo die ist&amp;rdquo;, wie kommen Nutzer an die Anwendung, wenn die Anwendung im Cluster mobil ist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Du brauchst Netz, einen Network Entry-Point (einen Load-Balancer oder so was), eine Backend-Erkennung,
und eine Methode eine feste externe IP an einen Endpoint zu kabeln, auch wenn der Endpoint im Cluster mobil ist.
Das endet im Fall Openstack mit einem SDN, und im Fall K8s mit einem SDN, einem Service Mesh oder beidem,
weil manche Leute Hosenträger und Gürtel wollen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In jedem Fall hast Du eine komplett neue Anforderungsliste für das Netz und das Netzwerk-Debugging an der Backe,
einfach dadurch, daß Du Images irgendwo im Cluster haben und debuggen können mußt.
So weit, so billig.
Das hat ja auch was Gutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir gewinnen nun die Möglichkeit, die Ausführungsumgebung einer Anwendung maschinenlesbar zu beschreiben,
und nach dieser Beschreibung zu bauen – das ist Infrastructure as Code (IaC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir gewinnen dadurch auch ein Manifest der Anwendung und ihrer Dependencies,
weil das ja für das Bauen vom Image Voraussetzung ist.
Das macht Compliance re CVEs, Lizenzen und Dependencies viel einfacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wie bekommen aber auch einen kompletten Methodenwechsel beim Debugging und beim Monitoring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jede Form von Introspektion &lt;em&gt;vor&lt;/em&gt; Openstack und K8s war hostbasiert.
Maschinen schrieben Logs in Files, und Entwickler loggten sich auf Kisten ein,
lasen die Logfiles oder starteten einen Debugger, der sich an die Anwendung attached,
und dann kann man in den laufenden Code gucken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn die Anwendung irgendwo im Cluster läuft, das in n+2 Kopien tut - dann geht das nicht mehr.
Du bekommst Prometheus und Metriken mit Dutzenden von Tags,
Honeycomb/Open Telemetry und viele andere Dinge &lt;em&gt;nur&lt;/em&gt;,
weil Entwickler das so nicht mehr tun können, denn die Anwendung läuft halt x-mal und irgendwo und ggf laufend woanders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das heißt, das Handwerk der Softwareentwicklung wechselt einmal komplett die Methodik.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aber auch wie wir über Anwendungen denken ändert sich:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Um Images zu bauen brauchen wir eine Bauanleitung, die beschreibt, was da rein geht – ein Manifest, das die Anwendung und ihre Komponenten (neue und fertig eingebundenen, also Dependencies) beschreibt. Dazu die Privilegien, die die Anwendung braucht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das alles wird einfacher, wenn wir Mutability vermeiden oder isolieren, also State in Datenbanken oder S3 Buckets oder anderen Sammelstellen konzentrieren.
Auch das Deployment wird so einfacher. Wir bekommen &lt;em&gt;Struktur&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dazu kommen Dienste, die die Infrastruktur jetzt wegen dieser festen Regeln,
und wegen ihrer eigenen Konstruktion bereitstellen und garantieren kann:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Cluster wird gesteuert.
Dazu gibt es eine Controlplane, und die weiß, was wo läuft und wem es gehört.
Wir bekommen also vom Cluster garantierte Identitäten und das Management dazu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ich weiß, daß die Gegenstelle auf meinem Port 8080 der Dienst x für den User z ist,
denn die Controlplane kann es mir garantieren oder mir sagen.
Und weil jede Kommunikation im Cluster von der Controlplane gesteuert und erlaubt wird,
ist diese Auskunft so verbindlich wie die Sicherheitsstruktur und Isolation des Clusters selbst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ich bekomme also eine vollkommen neue Dimension von Verlässlichkeit und Identität,
die ich so auf dedizierten Bare-Metal Maschinen in der Regel nicht habe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mit einem Mesh kann ich sogar den Code dazu weglassen,
denn Verschlüsselung, Metriken sammeln, Finden von Endpoints, Backoff und viele andere Dinge
passieren automatisch und standardisiert im Mesh, sodaß ich das in meine Anwendung nicht rein codieren muss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ich mache einfach ein GET auf &lt;code&gt;localhost:3081&lt;/code&gt; und das &amp;ldquo;Richtige&amp;rdquo; passiert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nichts davon ist sinnlose Komplexität oder &amp;ldquo;nur deswegen da, weil ein paar Hipster es cool fanden&amp;rdquo;,
sondern es kommt als logische Folge der Eskalation,
die in Gang gesetzt wird, wenn ich Hardware klein schneiden und effizient nutzen will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Und all das wirst Du duplizieren oder sogar in V1 dupliziert haben müssen, wenn Du selbst Clustern willst.
Nur daß Du K8s-Leute direkt einstellen kannst, die für Deinen selbst gekochten Cluster nicht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;versteckt-das-nicht-kosten&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#versteckt-das-nicht-kosten&#34;&gt;
	Versteckt das nicht Kosten?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nils Goroll:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nur, dass das neue Admin-Team, das jetzt &amp;ldquo;Devops&amp;rdquo; heisst, trotzdem noch obendrauf kommt.
Oder halt die Leute, die devopsen, auch wenn sie nicht mehr Team heissen dürfen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ja. Nein. Es ist kompliziert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Große Teile an Standard-Aufgaben werden auf die eine oder andere Weise an das Fachteam oder an AWS outgesourct.
Davon ist es nicht notwendigerweise weniger Arbeit, aber sie ist jetzt teilweise unsichtbar.
Du weißt halt nicht mehr, wie viele Stunden DBA KTLO sind, wenn jedes Fachteam sich selbst mit RDS Daten- und Schema-Migrationen rumschlagen muss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andererseits wirst Du sicher eine Gruppe von Menschen brauchen,
die sich auf Cloud-Infrastruktur, deren Design, Betriebs- und Sicherheitsarchitektur,
Abrechnung und Kostenkontrolle und derlei Dinge kümmert.
Und das sind nicht notwendigerweise weniger Menschen als Du vorher für Bare-Metal daheim eingeplant hattest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Und schließlich ist es kompliziert, weil Du durch eine Cloud mit IAM, einer Controlplane und Services eventuell Dinge gewinnst.
Nicht geldmäßig, denn Cloud ist immer 3-5x teurer als was immer Du vorher hattest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aber eventuell bekommst Du durch die harte administrative Grenze und den Zwang zur Kostenkontrolle als Organisation eine Motivation,
Deine betrieblichen Abläufe besser zu dokumentieren, strukturieren und in Beziehung zu den betriebsWIRTSCHAFTLICHEN Abläufen zu setzen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also &amp;ldquo;Was tun wir hier eigentlich und was davon dient dem Geld verdienen&amp;rdquo;?
Viele Unternehmen scheuen enorm vor diesen Fragen zurück.&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Aug 2023 01:02:03 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/08/09/frueher-hatten-wir-festplatten.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Früher hatten wir Festplatten.
Das ist ein Stapel Glasplatten, die mit Eisenoxid beschichtet sind, gleichmäßig schnell rotieren
und auf dem wir mit einem Kamm voller Schreib-Lese-Köpfe Teile magnetisieren oder die Magnetspuren auslesen.
Platten hatten CHS-Adressen für Sektoren, also Cylinder (drinnen, weiter draußen), Head (Scheibe) und Sektor (also welches Stück Scheibe).
Diese CHS-Adressen waren für das Betriebssystem sichtbar und das hat damit optimiert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/08/disk.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platten wurden dann schnell kompliziert.
Der Radius einer Spur auf einer drehenden Platte wächst, wenn man die Köpfe nach draußen schiebt.
Also passen draußen mehr Sektoren darauf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das bedeutet aber, daß das ganze CHS-System so nicht mehr funktioniert,
außer das OS kennt die spezielle und variable Geometrie der Platte.
Stattdessen hat die Platte einen eigenen Computer, den Controller, die Elektronik an der Unterseite der Platte.
Der kennt die Geometrie.
Das OS nicht.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Für das OS ist die Platte nun sehr viel einfacher: ein Array aus Sektoren.
Diese auf die wie auch immer geartete Plattengeometrie abzubilden ist Sache des Controllers,
der physisch mit der Platte verbunden ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir bekommen &amp;ldquo;Lineare Block Addressen&amp;rdquo;, LBA.
Viele OS kannten am Anfang gar keine LBA.
Daher geben Platten eine Fake-Geometrie raus,
die aufgeht und darstellbar ist &amp;ndash; und unsinnig ist.

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viele Leute hätten gerne, aus was für Gründen auch immer, mehr als eine Festplatte - auch wenn sie nur eine haben.
Zum Beispiel um mehr als ein Betriebssystem zu installieren oder um sonst wie Dinge aufzuteilen.
Die Lösung war die &amp;ldquo;Partition&amp;rdquo;.
Das ist eine Gruppe zusammenhängender Cylinder, die vom System als &amp;ldquo;eine logische Festplatte&amp;rdquo; angesehen werden.
Man schließt also sda an, und sieht bis zu 4 Geräte: sda1, sda2, sda3 und sda4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aus Gründen, die mit Microsoft und MS-DOS zu tun haben, gingen nur 4 Partitionen –
die Partitionstabelle am Anfang der Platte war ein festes Array mit genau 4 Einträgen.
Es sind auch immer 4, nur manche sind als unbenutzt markiert und werden dann stillschweigend ignoriert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn man nun mehr als 4 haben will?
Sehr einfach:
macht man sich eine &amp;ldquo;Erweiterte Partition&amp;rdquo;, die den ganzen Rest der Platte abdeckt und kann darin dann weitere Partitionen einrichten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/08/disk-03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist dann eine lineare Liste.
Die Nummern der logischen Partitionen in der erweiterten Partition fangen immer bei 5 an.
Man kann also eine Bootpartition sda1 haben und eine erweiterte Partition sda2, die dann sda5, sda6 und sda7 enthält.
Kein normal denkender Mensch will das so, weil das auch nervt:
Partitionen müssen ja zusammenhängend sein und auf eine Platte passen.
Man kann sie also nur dann erweitern, wenn hinter ihnen freier Platz ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ist da keiner, muss man den ganzen Rest der Platte &amp;ldquo;weiter nach hinten&amp;rdquo; kopieren und dann die Partition der Wahl erweitern.
Das kann sehr, sehr weh tun.
Was man stattdessen macht:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man tut alle seine Platten in einen Sack.
Diesen Sack nennen wir Volume Group, VG.
Die einzelnen Platten, die Physical Volumes, PVs, schneiden wir in gleich große Scheiben, die Physical Extents, PEs.
Die VG ist also ein Sack voll PEs, alle gleich groß, die auf unterschiedlichen Platten liegen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man will so um die 1000 bis 10.000 PEs in seiner VG haben.
Dann hantiert man mit Platz in Units von 1 Promille bis 0.1 Promille &amp;ndash; das ist genau genug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/08/disk-04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir können uns so Logical Volumes, also Laufwerke, zusammenbauen, die ein ganzes Vielfaches eines Extents groß sind und die aus LEs bestehen, Logical Extents.
Jedem LE wird mindestens ein PE als Backing Storage zugewiesen, aber da dies über eine Lookup-Tabelle passiert, können die PEs von irgendwoher kommen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/08/disk-05.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das Subsystem in Linux, das das macht, heißt LVM2, der Logical Volume Manager.
Er kann noch mehr:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Es ist möglich, einem LE mehr als ein PE zuzuweisen. Dann hat man ein RAID 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Es ist möglich, die Blöcke aus zwei PE auf unterschiedlichen PVs zu nehmen und blockweise abwechselnd zu benutzen. Dann hat man ein RAID 0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mithilfe der Device Mapper Layer, die unterhalb von LVM Dienst tut, kann man so jede Menge absurde Storage Artistik abziehen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Für uns ist wichtig zu verstehen, daß Partitionen in LVM – wegen LVM! – nicht mehr zusammenhängend sein müssen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es ist 2023.
Die Leute benutzen noch Devices, Partitionen und LVM, aber niemand benutzt noch Festplatten.
Alles ist SSD, eventuell sogar ohne beknacktes SATA-Interface, sondern mit dem Flash direkt auf dem PCIe-Bus.
Das ist dann NVME.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist super, weil das S in SATA für Seriell steht, also auch Zugriffe auf das Gerät serialisiert.
Das Gerät hat aber einen Haufen Chips, die man alle parallel anblasen könnte,
wenn das SSSSSSSATA nicht Zugriffe sssssserialsierte.
Also weg damit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/08/disk-06.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flash Storage hat nun noch ein anderes Problem.
Flash beschreibt &amp;ldquo;gelöschte&amp;rdquo; Blöcke in Sektoren von 512 Byte oder – neuerdings - 4096 Bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flash kann solche Sektoren aber nicht löschen, nur als &amp;ldquo;gelöscht&amp;rdquo; markieren.
Die eigentliche Löschung dauert recht lange und passiert in recht großen Erase Segmenten, die viele Sektoren enthalten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daher gibt es einen Hintergrundprozeß, der auf dem Controller läuft und guckt, ob valide Daten umsortiert werden können, sodaß ganze Erase Segmente frei werden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/08/disk-07.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dieser Hintergrundprozeß ist die Flash Translation Layer (FTL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sie hat eine große Zuordnungstabelle, die die eingehende LBA vom Computer auf eine physikalische Blockadresse im Flash mapped.
Und die FTL kann im Hintergrund Blöcke verschieben, umsortieren oder reorganisieren, ohne daß das vorne an der LBA sichtbar wäre.
Das hat eine Reihe von Konsequenzen.
Eine ist, daß man eine SSD nicht zum Löschen überschreiben kann –
die FTL sortiert hinten lustig Kram hin und her und es ist nicht gesagt,
dass ein Durchschreiben von LBA 0 nach LBA n alle Daten auf der SSD überschreibt, oder daß Allgemein nichts Lesbares mehr auf der SSD steht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daher gibt es bei vielen SSD eine Hardware Drive Encryption,
und zum Löschen des Laufwerkes geben wir der Disk einfach das Kommando, den Key zu vergessen.
Damit ist die faktisch gelöscht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oder wäre es, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/flaws-in-popular-ssd-drives-bypass-hardware-disk-encryption/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;könnte man der Implementierung der Hardware Drive Encryption vertrauen&lt;/a&gt;

.
Eventuell ist man mit so was wie LUKS und dem Wegwerfen der LUKS-Schlüssel besser dran als mit der Hardware Verschlüsselung von Drive-Controllern aus Chinesium.
Aber in jedem Fall ist man mit einem verschlüsselten Flash Drive besser dran als mit &amp;ldquo;Überschreiben&amp;rdquo;.
Oder man etabliert einen Prozess,
bei dem jeder Storage in einem Server in unseren RZ dies nur noch durch einen Shredder verlassen kann.
Falls man seinen Leuten vertraut, dass sie nicht doch mal ein Drive aus der Schrottkiste mitnehmen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eine bemerkenswerte Eigenschaft von Flash sind &amp;ldquo;Seeks&amp;rdquo;, also Datentransfers zwischen nicht physisch aufeinander folgenden Blöcken.
Disks schaffen so um die 200 Disk Seeks pro Sekunde, und die tatsächlichen Zeiten variieren auch stark – je Seek, desto Wait.
Bei SATA/SAS SSD haben wir circa 20.000 Seeks pro Sekunde und bei NVME bis zu 800.000 davon (weniger, je mehr Bits pro Flash-Zelle).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn Ihr bei der FTL aufgepasst habt,
dann wißt ihr, dass aufeinanderfolgende LBA eventuell gar keine aufeinanderfolgenden PBA sind,
also im Flash nicht nebeneinander liegen müssen.
Das merkt niemand, weil die Seek Zeiten bei Flash uniform sind.
Aber Moment mal &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir haben uniforme Seekzeiten und wir haben in der FTL eine Lookup-Tabelle die verdammt ähnlich aussieht wie die Lookup-Tabelle in LVM.
Können wir dann nicht auch Nichtzusammenhängende Partitionen in Hardware bekommen?
Können wir. Jedenfalls ein paar.
Das sind NVME Namespaces, also die &amp;ldquo;nX&amp;rdquo; an Euren /dev/nvme1n1-Devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die kann man mit dem &amp;ldquo;nvme&amp;rdquo; Kommando einrichten und abreißen und ihnen auch Platz zuweisen.
Der liegt dann irgendwo und die FTL weiß, wo genau.
Aber zusammenhängend ist das nicht, auch wenn Ihr das nie sehen werdet.
NVME Namespaces sind also so eine Art Hardware LVM mit einer limitierten Anzahl Plätzen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wie Hardware ist mein Hardware LVM denn?
Nun.
Mit SR-IOV bekommt jede einer Hardware-Nichtpartitionen auch ein Haufen Fake-PCI-Register,
die ich in den Adressraum etwa einer VM mappen könnte, sodaß effektiv jede VM eine &amp;ldquo;Partition&amp;rdquo; meiner NVME als fast echtes PCIe Busdevice sehen kann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leider gerät an dieser Stelle die Implementierung ins Zielfeld,
und teilt uns mit, daß das zwar schnell ist, aber leider nicht dicht,
und man darauf also nicht unbedingt vertrauen sollte.
Aber schön wäre es gewesen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wie dem auch sei:
Jetzt haben wir dieselbe Idee also&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;einmal in einem ARM-Rechner, der am Flash jenseites des PCIe Busses klebt – dem Flash Controller mit der FTL, als NVME Namespaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Und dann noch einmal eine Ebene höher, diesseits des PCIe, als LVM2 unter dem Filesystem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Und dann noch einmal eine Ebene höher, im Dateisystem, jedenfalls wenn es APFS oder ZFS ist, auf Dateisystem und Datei-Ebene.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dreimal dieselbe Idee, mit einer Lookup-Tabelle, Namespaces und dem Zusammenkleben von Blocks.
Außer, wenn man Apple ist.
Dann baut man seine Hardware selbst, realisiert den Flashcontroller in denselben Die wie die CPU oder lässt ihn gleich als Teil der CPU laufen,
schließlich ist es sowieso ein System-on-a-Chip.
Und redet dann mit den Flash-Chips neben der CPU.
Die sind eh nur neben dem Die mit der CPU, weil sie dort noch nicht hineinpassen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Und dann kann man diese Ebenen zumindest teilweise integrieren, einige Indirektionen sparen und generell schneller sein.
Das setzt aber natürlich voraus, daß man seine Hardware komplett kontrolliert, sodaß die Komponenten aufeinander abgestimmt werden können.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Außer Apple können das nur zwei Hände voll andere Firmen auf diesem Planeten,
und die anderen sind alle Cloudbetreiber, die ihre Hardware oder gar – wie Amazon-Annapurna-ARM – ihre CPUs selbst fertigen können.
Dann gehen auf einmal ein Haufen Abkürzungen und man kann so Sachen wie kaputte Hypervisoren und SR-IOV direkt selbst fixen.
Und das ist, warum Amazon schöne Dinge haben kann, aber ein &amp;ldquo;Private Cloud&amp;rdquo; Openstack nicht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jan schreibt: &amp;ldquo;Was Betriebssysteme noch nicht verstanden haben, ist das es nur noch Memory gibt.
In unterschiedlichen Geschwindigkeitsklassen.
Und Anbindungen.
Lokal, Netzwerk.
Das ist der einzige Unterschied.
Es gibt nur noch wenige Fälle.
Memory ist da oder nicht.
Latenz ist close to zero oder nicht deterministisch.
Deal with it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Unix ist ja alles entweder ein File, also persistent, und via open/read/write/seek/tell/close zu bearbeiten.
Oder ephemeral, und via malloc zu bekommen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speicher, so wie ihn Unix kennt, hat keine Eigenschaften (ephemeral, persistent), Granularität (byte, page welcher Größe auch immer),
und auch keine Eigner und Zugriffsrechte, sowie keine Verzeichnisdienste.
Die Infrastruktur, die ein Dateisystem bereitstellt, ist ja weit mehr als nur die open/read/write/close API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es ist auch der Verzeichnisbaum und die an den Dateien klebenden Zugriffsrechte, Flags, xattr und was es sonst noch so gibt, und eine bestimmte Locking-API.
Speicher hat zwar auch Locks, aber andere, und kennt die Konzepte Eigner, hierarchischer Namespace und was da sonst noch so existiert nicht.
Sun hat mal eine Zeit lang mit &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactional_memory&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;wilden Dingen&lt;/a&gt;

 herumgespielt, die Teile dieses Problemraumes adressiert haben.
HP auch, mit &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nextplatform.com/2019/09/09/inside-hpes-gen-z-switch-fabric/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;einem anderen Teilaspekt&lt;/a&gt;

 dieser Sache.
In beiden Fällen geht es um einen Haufen CPUs, die gemeinsam auf einem Speicher herumdengeln, der vielleicht oder vielleicht auch nicht lokal ist.
Das löst aber jeweils nur einen Teilaspekt des Problems.
Und es gibt keinerlei Software, die damit um könnte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Unix.
Anderswo gibt es schon seit den späten 80er Jahren Rechner mit einer Art &amp;ldquo;hardware unabhängigem Bytecode&amp;rdquo;,
64 Bit Uniform Address Space und einer Art speicherbasierten, transaktionsorientierten Datenbank, Namespaces und Zugriffsrechten.
Das ist dann aber kein Unix, sondern etwas anderes, bizarres, außerirdisches, das keiner von Euch je gesehen hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_AS/400&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Alien Systems/400&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist das, was man bekommt, wenn man eine JVM erfindet,
bevor es Java gibt und wenn man persistenten Speicher mit RAM und &amp;ldquo;mmap() aber in richtig&amp;rdquo; und wie eine Datenbank riechend erfindet.
AS/400 ist irgendeine CPU – das wurde in der Zwischenzeit auch mehrfach geändert und keiner hat es gemerkt – und
irgendwelcher Speicher (viel weniger als 64 Bit, aber das hat auch keiner gemerkt, das RAM ist ja nur Cache).
Statt &amp;ldquo;everything is a file&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;everything is an object&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In der Zwischenzeit hat Intel Optane wieder eingestellt.
Das Pricing war falsch, aber vor allen Dingen hat keiner das richtig nutzen können.
Zu RAM für ein Filesystem, und zu persistent für RAM – meh, was soll ich damit?
Wenn alles entweder ephemeral oder ein File ist, dann ist &amp;ldquo;persistent, und so schnell wie RAM&amp;rdquo; irgendwie nicht zu gebrauchen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>It&#39;s a Modulith</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/05/10/its-a-modulith.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2023 01:02:03 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/05/10/its-a-modulith.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Computers are simple&amp;rdquo; is what I am telling people I train.
&amp;ldquo;There are only Zeroes and Ones, and it is not getting much more complicated.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But computers are hard&amp;rdquo;, they respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That is correct.
In computer systems, complexity is almost never in the individual layers, but it comes from the width and breadth of the stack.
It&amp;rsquo;s in the interactions of the components that we are putting together.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you start with how a CPU is being built, and then put the layers of the stack on top of each other until you end up with a classical single-process application, in some object-oriented language, with a GUI – that&amp;rsquo;s around two to three dozen layers of abstractions piled on top of each other.
Things that one could learn the internals of, and how they interact.
But that&amp;rsquo;s only local, without network stacks, communication protocols, proxies, and without the peculiarities of distributed systems, which open up the same exercise, again, only across, not down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot to be said about computer science as a science, because anything that complicated is working at all.
All the interfaces, encapsulations, and abstractions are obviously good for &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; – as long as they don&amp;rsquo;t leak.
When they do leak, things get weird, fast:
One is making a small change somewhere in the stack, an epsilon,
and somewhere else something acts up, non-linearly, and does a giant delta, and everybody is having a very sad day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if developers prefer to sit in enclosed offices, without a phone, and with soundproof headphones,
that is because work on such systems is mostly to unfold the stack in your mind,
and to anticipate what will happen on all the other layers when you write a line of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-amazon-prime-video-team-publishes-a-paper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-amazon-prime-video-team-publishes-a-paper&#34;&gt;
	The Amazon Prime Video team publishes a paper
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this as a background, one can now read &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.primevideotech.com/video-streaming/scaling-up-the-prime-video-audio-video-monitoring-service-and-reducing-costs-by-90&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Scaling up the Prime Video audio/video monitoring service and reducing costs by 90%&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;rdquo;,
a writeup published by the Amazon Prime Video Streaming Team.
They have implemented a functionality which probes frames from the video stream sent to customers, applies tests and recognizes certain artefacts that impair quality,
so that they can be corrected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon being Amazon, they have implemented that as a pile of microservices that interact in an event-driven architecture with lambdas and step functions,
in order to shovel data from one S3 bucket into another, running the required analytics on the way.
Notification about things found are being put on SNS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That works as expected: The project was done exploratory, as a proof-of-concept, and they were able to show that it does what was requested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scaling up, they then found that the distribution of components was suboptimal:
Lambdas and step functions are not good elements for batch processing video frames with ML detectors, because they have never been designed for this.
They are good components for web applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it turns out that S3 is not a good storage and communication mechanism for fast and very temporary IPC,
because a web storage with low cost is optimized for low transaction rates, and it targets consumers that can tolerate high latency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article then presents a solution, which was to put all these things into a single container that are tightly coupled,
and put them into ECS.
Because the components are now within a single container, and hence on the same box, sharing the same memory,
they now can exchange video frames via shared memory instead of pushing them through http and TLS over the network.
Similarly, the lambdas and step function somewhere out on the network are now local procedure calls, or at least local RPC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, that eliminates a lot of communication latencies because the high-rpm part of the distributed system is now a single local application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-was-learned&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-was-learned&#34;&gt;
	What was learned
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surprising part, according to the team, was that this was a mostly painless process that required only minor code changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conceptually, the high-level architecture remained the same.
We still have exactly the same components as we had in the initial design (media conversion, detectors, or orchestration).
This allowed us to reuse a lot of code and quickly migrate to a new architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they summarize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is maybe the takeaway from this article:
In a cleanly architected and properly encapsulated system, the components can be redistributed and rearranged with only minor code changes.
We can change the layout of the system without having to start over.
The architecture was not really changed, but mostly the components&amp;rsquo; deployment was rearranged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;A modulithic deployment of co-located microservices allows for easy scaling and rearrangement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the subtitle of the article is
&amp;ldquo;The move from a distributed microservices architecture to a monolith application helped achieve higher scale, resilience, and reduce costs&amp;rdquo;.
This sets wrong expectations and makes it harder to pick up the actual learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the AWS Prime Video team arrived at is most closely described as a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.informatik-aktuell.de/entwicklung/methoden/modulith-first-der-angemessene-weg-zu-microservices.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Modulith&lt;/a&gt;

,
only that they arrived at it the other way around.
Fowler suggests you start
&lt;a href=&#34;https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Monolith first&lt;/a&gt;


and then chisel off the components you identify as standalone subservices.
They instead used pre-made AWS infrastructure components to build a highly modular prototype,
and then identified tightly coupled components and merged their deployment without giving up the modular structure.
Fowler himself points to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://samnewman.io/blog/2015/04/07/microservices-for-greenfield/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;an article by Sam Newman&lt;/a&gt;


and the book that came from it as a way of doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is not really a single-instance monolith, anyway.
Components are merged into a single ECS container, but of course ECS will deploy it with the required degree of parallelism,
and it is still part of a larger system that communicates in an event-driven architecture using lambdas and messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if this article is anything, it is an example of the benefits good observability has,
and how a good architecture allows you to rearrange the layout of well-isolated and structured components with clean interfaces at will.
The application can be made to run on different substrates, in order to react to different demands of scale or changing business requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or in other words, people who understand how their stuff works have few problems to adjust their application to changing requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Revisiting the file server</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/02/06/revisiting-the-file-server.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 21:06:03 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/02/06/revisiting-the-file-server.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The new disks in the file server had synchronized nicely, and that resulted in an interesting graph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/02/disk-sync.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sectors on the outer part of a hard disk are transferred faster than inner sectors. You can see how the disk speed halves between the outermost and the innermost part.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While watching, I decided on a whim that I wanted to convert the entire setup from using Linux &lt;code&gt;mdraid&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;dmraid&lt;/code&gt;, the LVM2 implementation of RAID1.
It is essentially the same code, but integrated into LVM2 instead of using &lt;code&gt;mdadm&lt;/code&gt; for control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had already experimented with &lt;code&gt;dmraid&lt;/code&gt; before, as documented in &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2019/12/02/cloning-and-splitting-logical-volumes.html&#34;&gt;an earlier article&lt;/a&gt;

, and that was &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2019/12/03/trying-lvmraid-for-real.html&#34;&gt;not without problems&lt;/a&gt;

.
But since the array would contain no original data, only backups, I decided to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here we go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;destroying-the-mdraid&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#destroying-the-mdraid&#34;&gt;
	Destroying the &lt;code&gt;mdraid&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had created a RAID-1 pair of the disks &lt;code&gt;/dev/sdb2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/dev/sdc2&lt;/code&gt; under the name &lt;code&gt;/dev/md126&lt;/code&gt;, then added &lt;code&gt;/dev/md126&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;hdd&lt;/code&gt; volume group. In order to get the disks back, I had to undo this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we need to check if the &lt;code&gt;/dev/md126&lt;/code&gt; PV is empty:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; pvdisplay --map /dev/sda2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;  --- Physical volume ---
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;  PV Name               /dev/md126
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;  VG Name               hdd
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;  PV Size               9.09 TiB / not usable 1022.98 MiB
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;  Allocatable           yes
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;  PE Size               1.00 GiB
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;  Total PE              9303
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;  Free PE               9303
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;  Allocated PE          0
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;  PV UUID               ...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;  --- Physical Segments ---
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;  Physical extent 1 to 9302:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;    FREE
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s fine. We can remove the pair from the volume group again, remove the LVM2 label, and then stop and destroy the raid:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; vgreduce hdd /dev/md126
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; pvremove /dev/md126
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; mdadm --stop /dev/md126
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; mdadm --remove /dev/md126
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; mdadm --zero-superblock /dev/sdb2 /dev/sdc2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That did not work: An Ubuntu Component, &lt;code&gt;os-prober&lt;/code&gt;, took possession of the devices after removing the RAID-1. I had to actually uninstall the component and remove the &lt;code&gt;osprober&lt;/code&gt; from devicemapper before I could continue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;### After uninstalling os-prober:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; dmsetup ls
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; dmsetup remove osprober-linux-sdb2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; dmsetup remove osprober-linux-sdc2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; mdadm --zero-superblock /dev/sdb2 /dev/sdc2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;preparing-the-disks-individually-for-lvm2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#preparing-the-disks-individually-for-lvm2&#34;&gt;
	Preparing the disks individually for LVM2
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only then I could continue, add the disks to LVM2 and extend the &lt;code&gt;hdd&lt;/code&gt; volume group:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; pvcreate /dev/sd&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;b,c&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; vgextend hdd /dev/sd&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;b,c&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now have a very weird, asymmetric VG in which there is a single 9.09 TiB raid PV and two 9.09 TiB unraided PVs.
Our next objective is to evacuate the raided PV, and then destroy this as well, adding the disks back unraided.
This will result in a 36 TiB total VG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;evacuating-devmd127-to-unraid-it&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#evacuating-devmd127-to-unraid-it&#34;&gt;
	Evacuating &lt;code&gt;/dev/md127&lt;/code&gt; to unraid it
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is going to take a long time. We need to do this in a &lt;code&gt;tmux&lt;/code&gt; session:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; pvmove /dev/md127 /dev/sdb2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will, over the course of about one day, move all physical extents from &lt;code&gt;/dev/md127&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;/dev/sdb2&lt;/code&gt;.
This exposes us to disk failure, as for the moment the data on &lt;code&gt;/dev/sdb2&lt;/code&gt; is unraided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;restoring-redundancy&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#restoring-redundancy&#34;&gt;
	Restoring redundancy
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two kinds of backup on this disk pack:
A number of Apple Time Machine targets and an Acronis Windws target, &lt;code&gt;tm_*&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;win_*&lt;/code&gt;, and an internal backup that is being produced by a cron job, &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt;ing data from the internal SSDs to the disks, &lt;code&gt;/backup&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to destroy the &lt;code&gt;/backup&lt;/code&gt; LV and recreate it as a &lt;code&gt;raid10&lt;/code&gt; across all 4 disks.
This was relatively easy, and worked immediately &amp;ndash; it just took a few hours for the backup job to run from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; umount /backup
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; lvremove /dev/hdd/backup
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; lvcreate --type raid10 -i2 -m1 -n backup -L4T hdd
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; mkfs -t xfs -f /dev/hdd/backup
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; mount /backup
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; /root/bin/make-backup
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Time Machine and Acronis targets, I decided to &lt;code&gt;lvconvert&lt;/code&gt; them to &lt;code&gt;raid1&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2019/12/02/cloning-and-splitting-logical-volumes.html&#34;&gt;As stated before&lt;/a&gt;

, there are two competing implementations of of RAID in LVM2, &lt;code&gt;--type mirror&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;--type raid1&lt;/code&gt;.
The &lt;code&gt;mirror&lt;/code&gt; implementation is very extremely strongly deprecated, the &lt;code&gt;raid1&lt;/code&gt; implementation is okay, because it uses the same code as  &lt;code&gt;mdraid&lt;/code&gt; internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to make sure to specify &lt;code&gt;--type raid1&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;lvconvert&lt;/code&gt; command to ensure the proper type is being used.
For each target we do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; lvconvert --type raid1 -m1 /dev/hdd/tm_...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This returns immediately, and begins to sync the mirror halves internally.
If we at this point convert all Time Machine and Acronis targets at once, the sync speed is abysmally slow, because of disk head treshing.
There is no way to stop this.
The only option is to slow down all resyncs except one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;### for all targets, slow them down to minimum&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;  lvchange --maxrecoveryspeed&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;1k /dev/hdd/tm_...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;### for one target, set a very large max speed:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; lvchange --maxrecoveryspeed&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;100000k /dev/hdd/tm_...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;and then let one &lt;code&gt;tm_...&lt;/code&gt; target finish.
After that, we can increase the max sync speed for the next target, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what a &lt;code&gt;--type raid1&lt;/code&gt; looks like in &lt;code&gt;lsblk&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; lsblk /dev/sda2 /dev/sdg2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;NAME                     MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;├─hdd-tm_aircat_rmeta_0  253:18   0    1G  0 lvm

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;├─hdd-tm_aircat_rimage_0 253:25   0    1T  0 lvm

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;sdg2                       8:98   0  9.1T  0 part
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;├─hdd-tm_aircat_rmeta_1  253:26   0    1G  0 lvm
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;│ └─hdd-tm_aircat        253:20   0    1T  0 lvm  /export/tm_aircat
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;├─hdd-tm_aircat_rimage_1 253:30   0    1T  0 lvm
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;│ └─hdd-tm_aircat        253:20   0    1T  0 lvm  /export/tm_aircat
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is, for each leg of the RAID1 you get a &lt;code&gt;rimage&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rmeta&lt;/code&gt; LV.
If the LVs are named &lt;code&gt;mimage_0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mimage1&lt;/code&gt; and there is no &lt;code&gt;rmeta&lt;/code&gt; but only a single &lt;code&gt;mlog&lt;/code&gt;, this is not &lt;code&gt;--type raid&lt;/code&gt;, but the deprecated &lt;code&gt;mirror&lt;/code&gt; implementation.
This is not good, and should be converted to &lt;code&gt;--type raid1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no way to convert a &lt;code&gt;linear&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;raid1&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;raid10&lt;/code&gt;, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;checking-status-and-progress&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#checking-status-and-progress&#34;&gt;
	Checking status and progress
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few handy commands to check the status and the progress of the conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monitor the sync state of the devices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; lvs -a -o name,copy_percent,devices,raid_max_recovery_rate,raid_mismatch_count,raid_sync_action hdd
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;-a&lt;/code&gt; shows all the LVs, even the internal ones.
We are interested into the &lt;code&gt;copy_percent&lt;/code&gt; to see the progress of the sync.
We also want the &lt;code&gt;max_recovery_rate&lt;/code&gt;, because we might have throttled it with the &lt;code&gt;lvchange&lt;/code&gt; command mentioned above.
And we want to see the &lt;code&gt;raid_mismatch_count&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;raid_sync_action&lt;/code&gt; to see what&amp;rsquo;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the ubiquitous &lt;code&gt;lvs -a -o +devices&lt;/code&gt; is always handy to get an impression of the entire VG:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; lvs -a -o +devices hdd
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;  LV                   VG  Attr       LSize   Pool Origin Data%  Meta%  Move Log Cpy%Sync Convert Devices

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;defragmenting-devsdb2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#defragmenting-devsdb2&#34;&gt;
	Defragmenting &lt;code&gt;dev/sdb2&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the way we created things, initially all &lt;code&gt;RAID1&lt;/code&gt; have the left leg of their mirror on &lt;code&gt;/dev/sdb2&lt;/code&gt;, because that is where we &lt;code&gt;pvmove&lt;/code&gt;ed stuff initially.
We might want to fix that, and push a few things over.
I did that, as can be seen by the &lt;code&gt;lvs -a -o +devices hdd&lt;/code&gt; output further up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; pvmove -n &amp;lt;LV_name&amp;gt; /dev/sdb2 /dev/sdg2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will move all data belonging to &lt;code&gt;LV_name&lt;/code&gt; that is currently on &lt;code&gt;/dev/sdb2&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;/dev/sdg2&lt;/code&gt;.
Again, this will take a long time, and there should be no other sync action currently active for maximum speed, as rotating disks slow down a lot when there are competing disk seeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leaves us with a fragmented &lt;code&gt;/dev/sdb2&lt;/code&gt; and LVs on higher numbered extents, which are a lot slower than lower numbered extents.
We could fix that as well, again with &lt;code&gt;pvmove&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; pvdisplay --map /dev/sdc2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;  Physical extent 3587 to 3596:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;    Logical volume      /dev/hdd/keks_rimage_1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;    Logical extents     0 to 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;  Physical extent 3597 to 4607:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;    FREE
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; pvmove -n keks --alloc anywhere /dev/sdc2:3587-3596 /dev/sdc2:4000-4009
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt; /dev/sdc2: Moved: 0.00%
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt; ...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt; /dev/sdc2: Moved: 100.00%
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This moves extents internally on a drive.
&lt;code&gt;pvmove&lt;/code&gt; normally refuses to do this, so we have to tell it to shut up about this, using &lt;code&gt;--alloc anywhere&lt;/code&gt;.
We then use extent-addressing to change the map manually:
We move data from &lt;code&gt;/dev/sdc2:3587-3596&lt;/code&gt;, the entire &lt;code&gt;keks&lt;/code&gt; Test-LV, somewhere into the &lt;code&gt;FREE&lt;/code&gt; space, &lt;code&gt;4000-4009&lt;/code&gt;.

    &lt;a href=&#34;#do-you-have-checksums&#34;&gt;
	Do you have checksums?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not yet.
There is a thing called &lt;code&gt;dm-integrity&lt;/code&gt;, though, and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/MawKKe/caa2bbf7edcc072129d73b61ae7815fb&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;gist&lt;/a&gt;

 that I have to try. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/device-mapper/dm-integrity.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;dm-integrity Documentation&lt;/a&gt;

 is here.
And &lt;code&gt;integritysetup&lt;/code&gt; is part of &lt;code&gt;cryptsetup-bin&lt;/code&gt; on Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Time to grow the file server</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/02/01/time-to-grow-the-file-server.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2022 21:06:03 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/02/01/time-to-grow-the-file-server.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The old file server was full, and since the little one got more local storage in his laptop, I also needed more storage for backup to match.
I am running a 5x cage using up 3 disk slots in a Midi-Tower.
Two slots are filled with Seagate Ironwolf 10 TB disks already, the rest is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B019HE69FO&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/02/cold-storage1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A 5x &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B019HE69FO&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;hot swap disk cage&lt;/a&gt;

 using 3 disk slots in a midi tower.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disk situation in the machine was like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;kris@server:~$ sudo vgs
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;[sudo] password for kris: 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;  VG     #PV #LV #SN Attr   VSize   VFree
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;  data     2  16   0 wz--n-   7.28t   3.24t
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;  hdd      2   5   0 wz--n-   9.08t   5.00g
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;  system   1   4   0 wz--n- 466.94g 234.94g
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;hdd&lt;/code&gt; volume group is running in a RAID-1 configuration using &lt;code&gt;mdraid&lt;/code&gt; for historical reasons - this is a very old machine.
Additional space would be added as another &lt;code&gt;mdraid&lt;/code&gt;, and then linearly extend the existing volume.
That is fine, the disks are used as backup targets for a number of Mac devices only and speed or seeks are not our primary goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ordered two additional Seagate Ironwolf 10 TB disks to match the existing ones.
They came in rather cold from the delivery van:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/02/cold-storage2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After unpacking the disk chassis had single digit celsius temperatures.
When I remembered to take a thermal image they were already warmed up a bit.
I let them warm up a bit more before I put them in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pushing in the disks generated a lot of kernel log, and also a nice graph in the temperature monitoring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/02/cold-storage3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new disks are warming up rapidly. The dropping line is a scratch disk that I have been taking out of slot 3 and pushing back in into slot 5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;/dev/sdb1 : start=        2048, size=    20971520, type=..., uuid=...., name=&amp;#34;Linux filesystem&amp;#34;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;/dev/sdb2 : start=    20973568, size= 19511900127, type=..., uuid=...., name=&amp;#34;Linux RAID&amp;#34;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This works, because &lt;code&gt;sfdisk&lt;/code&gt; like &lt;code&gt;sgdisk&lt;/code&gt; understands about MBR and GPT partition tables, and can handle large 10 TB partitions. We have a 10 GB &lt;code&gt;/dev/sdb1&lt;/code&gt; as a potential boot space, and use the rest of the disk as a giant &lt;code&gt;/dev/sdb2&lt;/code&gt; in LVM2. The other disk, &lt;code&gt;/dev/sdc&lt;/code&gt; matches this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can then construct the RAID from the two partitions &lt;code&gt;/dev/sd{b,c}2&lt;/code&gt;. Because this is a large device, &lt;code&gt;mdadm&lt;/code&gt; will also automatically add an internal bitmap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while the RAID synchronizes in the background, we can turn the new device into a physical volume and add it to the &lt;code&gt;hdd&lt;/code&gt; volume group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;kris@server:~$ sudo pvcreate /dev/md126

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;kris@server:~$ sudo vgextend hdd /dev/md126

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;  VG     #PV #LV #SN Attr   VSize   VFree
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;  data     2  16   0 wz--n-   7.28t   3.24t

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that, we now have sufficient disk space to continue to work.
After the sync completes, I will &lt;code&gt;lvconvert&lt;/code&gt; two existing backup partitions into mirrors to move them to the new disk pair, and then dissolve the mirror, dropping the image on the old half.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AMD und 128 cores</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/11/08/amd-und-128-cores.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 13:28:27 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/11/08/amd-und-128-cores.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wir sprachen in
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/09/30/software-defined-silicon.html&#34;&gt;Software Defined Silicon&lt;/a&gt;


darüber, wie die CPU-Bedürfnisse von Hyperscalern und normalen Kunden divergieren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperscaler haben Interesse an immer größeren CPUs mit immer mehr Kernen, und immer höherer Dichte in ihren Rechenzentren. [&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normale Kunden sehen das nicht so: man kann in einer 64C/128T-Core-Single-Socket-Konfiguration mit 2-4 TB RAM unter Umständen den gesamten Serverbedarf einer kleineren Firma in einer einzelnen physikalischen Maschine in VMs unterbringen.
Das Problem dabei: Explosionsradius, wenn mal etwas ausfällt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Und das passiert:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;amp;px=AMD-Zen-4-Genoa-Bergamo&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;AMD Shares Early Details Of Zen 4 Genoa, Bergamo&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heute hat AMD einen Ausblick auf die kommenden Zen 4 CPUs geliefert:
Die normale &amp;ldquo;Genoa&amp;rdquo; wird 96 Cores pro Socket liefern, also 192C/384T in einem 2P-Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es wird jedoch von dieser CPU auch eine &amp;ldquo;Bergamo&amp;rdquo;-Variante geben, und das ist eine
&amp;ldquo;high-core count compute engine designed for cloud-native workloads&amp;rdquo;.
Das sind dann 256C/512T in einem 2P-Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist nicht nur zu viel Maschinerie in einer einzelnen Kiste, sondern auch in einem normalen Rechenzentrums-Rack vermutlich nicht mehr so einfach zu kühlen.
Wenn man sich als Hyperscaler jedoch seine Rechenzentren nach Maß bauen lässt, sollte das alles nicht weiter weh tun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wozu der 4K-Monitor, fragst Du?
Na, damit die &amp;lsquo;htop&amp;rsquo; Anzeige auf den Bildschirm passt.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 17:10:21 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/10/27/metaverse-en.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/isotopp/status/1450739310546886657&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;wrote on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;

 something about the term &amp;ldquo;Metaverse&amp;rdquo;.
That led to a contact with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/michacarl&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Michael Carl&lt;/a&gt;

, who wanted to make an episode for his &lt;a href=&#34;https://carls-zukunft.de/folge-58-how-to-build-a-metaversum-in-three-simple-steps/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Podcast&lt;/a&gt;

 with me.
My &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_OIl_bcrjVczLQrMrVnt5IoYbitp1504mb2GbQK0EM4/edit#heading=h.wbe6wnc7fg59&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;german notes and talk prep&lt;/a&gt;

 are now also available here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;metaverse&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#metaverse&#34;&gt;
	Metaverse
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;Metaverse&amp;rdquo; was initially coined by Neal Stephenson in 1992, but in the context of the current discussion it was defined as in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Metaverse: What It Is, Where to Find it, Who Will Build It, and Fortnite&lt;/a&gt;

 by Matthew Ball. Ball later &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.matthewball.vc/the-metaverse&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;wrote a lot more about the same&lt;/a&gt;

, and that led to the current Valley Hype around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are starting with games, who no longer are what they started out as, but somehow transcended:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fortnite by Epic Games, which now also hosts non-Fortnite events,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roblox, a platform to make and host low-end games, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minecraft in the Java and Bedrock editions, to show how both fail differently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fortnite&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#fortnite&#34;&gt;
	Fortnite
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortnite originally was a Battle Royale game, but is now also a platform that can host events. You can also buy skins for your characters or items, often in a partnership with other IP, for example Marvel/DC super heroes.
People gave concerts in there, or hosting other events.
Epic likes to do this, openly, because it establishes Fortnite with people who are not originally interested in Battle Royale or part of gaming culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epic Games also makes the Unreal Engine, and the associated pipelines for creating and editing in-game assets, hosts a market to sell these things, and is building a living infrastructure to produce games, and market them.
They are in a way the invisible back-cover of many games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;roblox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#roblox&#34;&gt;
	Roblox
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, but way more casual, Roblox operates a platform to create, host and market low-end games, &amp;ldquo;making games as a game&amp;rdquo;, and matching this, they also have assets, and an asset and game marketing outlet.
Roblox is mostly a thing with young and very young people, and vastly underrated with older people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;minecraft-in-two-flavors&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#minecraft-in-two-flavors&#34;&gt;
	Minecraft in two flavors
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minecraft is a classic: The original game is written in Java, and meanwhile completely replaceable with third party components. There are alternative clients, alternative servers, and alternative assets.
The game is bad: It is a sandbox without much story, an ill-defined goal and primitive graphics, the original servers are slow and buggy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the graphics are simple enough that even old potato computers can render it.
It is written in Java, which can be easily reversed and extended without cooperation from the vendor.
And thus there is an extremely rich community of modders, server and client plugins, and many other extensions.
As such, Minecraft is a gateway drug into Java programming with young people, because it has unlimited potential for self-motivation and initiates undirected and unprompted learning in many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of that leads to monetization that the current owner, Microsoft, can hook on.
As an IP asset, Minecraft Java is an utter failure, because after the initial purchase Microsoft is no longer part of the value chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why there is &amp;ldquo;Minecraft Bedrock Edition&amp;rdquo;, more performant, better designed and from the ground up with an asset marketplace.
You can buy Bedrock extensions in that marketplace, and only there.
As a maker of extensions, you will have to license IP from Microsoft, and pay percentages, as a customer anyway.
With gamers, it is not very popular, sterile, and without its own subculture.
Compared to the Java Edition, an even bigger failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bedrock model is comparable to the Apple Developer mode, but smaller in scope:
You can&amp;rsquo;t seriously develop for Apple machines without having an Apple-ID, a developer license, support for Apple Cloud for handover, and without leaving percentages to the Apple Store.
Bedrock copies that model, but not as a Computer-Tablet ecosystem, only as a game, and that did not take off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;metaverse-a-first-definition&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#metaverse-a-first-definition&#34;&gt;
	Metaverse: A first definition.
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition of &amp;ldquo;Metaverse&amp;rdquo; is hence less 3D goggles, and more &amp;ldquo;Integration of the gaming industry with the value chain of the entertainment industry for an open digital asset market&amp;rdquo;.
Or more open: siphoning off percentages along the gaming value chain during production, marketing and usage, and improving the value of gaming assets by partnering with entertainment properties and using their IP in gaming contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective is to get more lifetime consumer budget out of a person, without bothering them too much by investing actual time.
We want to extend the scope of &amp;ldquo;sellable media&amp;rdquo; in the widest sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;attention-and-time-budgets&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#attention-and-time-budgets&#34;&gt;
	Attention and time budgets
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have monetary limits, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_and_discretionary_income&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;the consumption part of disposable income&lt;/a&gt;

.
They also have time limits, an attention budget.
Both are convertible, but that is media dependent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming a useful lifetime of 60 years for media consumption, during that time I could read for example one book per week, for a total of 40 books per year.
In a total lifetime, that are 2400 books, at - say - 30 Euro each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With AAA games, one can do around 4-6 of them per year, 240-300 in a lifetime, at a value of around 60 Euro each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a total lifetime value of around 70k Euro in books, or 20k Euro in games per person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see that games are too cheap compared to their production cost, but a higher price than 60 Euro is unrealistic even for AAA titles.
That is one reason why each and every game has additional ways of spending money after purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general with both media types, there is a lot of my lifetime attention span bound for comparatively little money:
We need to up the burn rate.
Books, movies and especially AAA games are much too valuable per time and their consume binds too much attention for the business to scale up.
We need a different way to extract money that does not bind as many minutes of person-lifetime and attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is critically important, because there is also a lot of free content which competes for attention with our paid for assets, and which often is &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo; to bind time which we then cannot monetize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-sidebar-death-and-inheritances&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#a-sidebar-death-and-inheritances&#34;&gt;
	A sidebar: death and inheritances
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an aging population there is the sidebar &amp;ldquo;boomers die, their children inherit&amp;rdquo;.
For example, right now I have around 600 Steam titles, and around 1000 Kindle books.
When I die this represents multiple 10k Euro of value.
How can my son inherit this?
Politics has no answers, and the vendors say &amp;ldquo;he won&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rdquo;.
I can only leave my Steam login to my son, and crack the DRM of my Kindle titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economically, Kindle and Steam inheritances are largely irrelevant, or would be even be positive, and it is unclear why vendors are blocking this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I am inheriting a villa at the lake, I can go in, open the veranda, walk down through the park to the shore and enjoy the asset within minutes.
It does not take much time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inheriting my Kindle and Steam library, my son will need to invest a lot of time to enjoy that:
With 1200 books that will bind 30 years of lifetime,  and with an inheritance of 1000 games there will be titles from 2002 that look like drawn with crayons today.
I am inheriting &amp;ldquo;Skyrim&amp;rdquo;, but I will have to purchase the &amp;ldquo;VR&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Remastered&amp;rdquo; editions of that myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see immediately that this will hardly lead to a loss in revenue for vendors, in some cases it is more like a kind of advertisement, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;assets-high-budget-little-time&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#assets-high-budget-little-time&#34;&gt;
	Assets: high budget, little time
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even today, games offer loot boxes, pay-to-win and pay-to-skip purchases, and they sell cosmetics. Unlike the first three, the last one is hardly controversial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay-to-Win: to finish the game successfully you have to buy equipment with real money. Ideally this becomes apparent only of tou already are invested in the game emotionally and with lifetime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay-to-Skip: gameplay is often interrupted with annoying delays in which you can&amp;rsquo;t play, except you purchase immediate continuations with real money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lootboxes: The game sells containers with &amp;ldquo;random&amp;rdquo; in-game assets to you, some of which are very important in the context of the game. The actual game is just a wrapper for an addictive (and usually rigged) game of chance. The practice is already illegal as unregulated gambling in several EU countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to this, cosmetics are widely accepted: These are assets that change the way the character or their equipment looks like, without affecting gameplay. Also, virtual houses and house furnishings that have no effect on gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in &amp;ldquo;Elder Scrolls Online&amp;rdquo; as a player you can get easily and early in-game houses which are spectacularly located, and have a lot of empty space for decorations.
Furnishings to decorate the house can be gotten as trophies in-game, but every day things can only be gotten by using real money and purchase from the shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has many desirable properties for the vendor:
The player can spend a lot of money (without limits!) in-game, and hardly has to invest time or attention to make use of these assets.
We are no longer revenue-bound by the players&amp;rsquo; attention budget.
This is a much better thing to sell than books, films or the games themselves.
The game only provides context and reason for the cosmetics to exist, and defines their visuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epic-games&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#epic-games&#34;&gt;
	Epic Games
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is precisely the operating model of Epic Games:
With the Unreal Engine the company owns a platform for the fast and efficient design and rendering of really good-looking games.
This also includes the tooling for making in-game assets, but also a market to sell these to other game developers.
With the Epic Launcher and the integrated shop this is also a platform for game sales, and to collect meta and usage data for Epic, which again (for money) are sold back to the developer as analytics.
Epic operates a payment system, which pipes money from the customer to the developer, not only for games, but also for extensions, DLC and in-game purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Fortnite, Epic has their own game, which at the same time can also sell 3D assets to players as equipment, cosmetics and other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortnite is a special kind of game - player vs. player, battle royal - players play against each other and last man standing wins the round.
This kind of game is not interesting for all target demographics, but the engine of Fortnite is flexible and can be repurposed.
This enables other use-cases, among them also as a &amp;ldquo;virtual event platform&amp;rdquo;, which also keeps the interest up through media tie-ins and licensed IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interpretation of &amp;ldquo;The Metaverse&amp;rdquo; as a value chain for digital assets, specifically 3D assets, is too short-sighted:
As an ecosystem with a controlled number of large market operators and a very large numbers of content creators and customers the foundations will look better and have better longevity.
It is entirely possible to allow third parties to operate in this &amp;ldquo;virtual world&amp;rdquo;, trade with each other, especially if the market operators at all times get a tiny share from each transaction.
This is the idea of the &amp;ldquo;Microsoft tax&amp;rdquo;, revitalized.&lt;/p&gt;

	Players in this market
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different parties have different starting positions and strengths:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Epic Games/Fortnite - weak in IP, but some original IP, even if niche. Unreal Engine and other things on the &amp;ldquo;games invisible back-cover&amp;rdquo; as a big strength.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roblox - original IP, very young customers, grooms them into future customers, wait 10 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft - Minecraft, MS Store et al., too enterprise for success? But Halo, MSFS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple (sic!) - no IP, but platform/chain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disney (sic!) - only IP, but weak marketing outside of films/merchandise. Knows the game very well in the real world: Imagine Disneyland principles applied to a Metaverse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook - wants in at all costs, &amp;ldquo;pivot our enterprise&amp;rdquo;: If &amp;ldquo;social&amp;rdquo; of the future is &amp;ldquo;here&amp;rdquo;, we need to be &amp;ldquo;here&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google - all of this is a reason why Stadia still exists, despite being a flop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon - this is where the gaming strategy of Amazon is anchored. Amazon would like to be the AWS of the gaming world, instead of Epic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

 as a Market Maturity Model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are in the chaotic phase of market maturity:
Nobody has a business model for this.
It is unclear what the market will look like, what the standards are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the landgrab phase, building market share in a new and emerging market.
Interop is secondary, because the future standards are not yet visible.
Player try to differentiate themselves with features, also to find out which features matter.
All players grow in a growing market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as a business model and stable feature lists exists and there is a system for money extraction the market can consolidate.
As always, 3-5 companies will dominate the market, which is dropping out of hypergrowth.
The dominating companies acknowledge their respective existence and roles, and compete semi-cooperatively:
It is more important to erect barriers to entry for disruptors than to destroy the existing competition, and hence there will be complex, hard to implement standards with expensive compliance tests.
This will then, against all wishes, lead to interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;metaverse-revised-definition&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#metaverse-revised-definition&#34;&gt;
	Metaverse, revised definition
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we get:
The Metaverse is an integration of the gaming industry with the entertainment industry, and the merging of their value chains, optionally extracting a transactional tax at any point of the value chain.
The objective is to monetize the lifetime intellectual consumption budget of any person, and extending the market of products relevant to that person, decoupling spend from attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A main result is that books, films and games bind too much time to consume and limit spend.
3D assets are a better sale binding for less time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also the backdrop to read &amp;ldquo;Epic vs. Apple and Google&amp;rdquo; properly:
This is about opening the monopolistic markets these companies have for their hardware products, and allow other companies to monetize their walled gardens with their own offerings directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The german outlook is dreary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lacking highspeed, low latency infrastructure for gaming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lacking a German company with identity platforms (&amp;ldquo;Login with x&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lacking resources and companies with 3D asset tooling, production, marketplaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lacking German film/tv/literature IP that can be integrated with any of this, especially on a global scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;German companies and culture looks inward, into the own country, not towards a global cultural base.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare with Korea: Korean production chains in K-Pop; Korean &amp;ldquo;cultural technology&amp;rdquo; that integrated other cultures styles and art and integrates it into K-Pop; production and grooming pipelines for stars and starlets; emerging similar chains for IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison, Germany counts as unarmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Property&amp;rdquo; in a simulated reality looks like property, but is virtual and can be duplicated easily.
Virtualization removes resource constraints in production, but &amp;ldquo;value&amp;rdquo; is only created by uniqueness in consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The platform operators and &amp;ldquo;tax&amp;rdquo; authorities have full market transparency and can meter the time spent and consumption habits of everybody.
They know what you look at and listen to, what you are using, which styles you like and can sell this data for money to creators. They will also sell access to you to creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HHOS: in the future at birth of child, you will first have to decide which corporate tribe it joins and then find a name compliant with that tribes rules. Switching between tribes is as complicated as an emigration to or from North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A central building block is also DRM, here under the marketing name of &amp;ldquo;NFT&amp;rdquo;. NFT is the blockchain word for DRM, only with added destruction of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unique things are only possible with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;locking the machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TPM,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in-game only licensed assets and mods usable, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NFT Laser Eyes crypto bullshit that burns the planet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context also the current engagement of Epic in the NFT bull.
Proper standards will be important, and &amp;ldquo;identity&amp;rdquo; is central for &amp;ldquo;property&amp;rdquo;.
This does not need blockchain, and will work better without - the platforms are central anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend, commenting further:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to bind these people into this universe (&amp;ldquo;Hyperinclusion&amp;rdquo;).
They buy in the metaverses store, date their partners in metaverse locations, watch ads for products only available in the metaverse, and can hardly formulate metaverse critical thinking.
There is no public space anymore, everything is part of the gated community (cf loss of the almende).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be competition between a small number of metaverses, but within one metaverse there is only managed competition.
That is, the metaverse monopolizes a life in its totality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a lot like mining towns in the US in the late 19th century.
The shop was owned by the mine, the priest was employed by the mine, and the sheriff and mayor were mine employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effectively the FB strategy is to make their social media monopoly permanent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads us to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;currency&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#currency&#34;&gt;
	Currency
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrencies have demonstrated to large players that money creation is now &amp;ldquo;up for grabs&amp;rdquo;.
A metaverse is a very good environment to realize that &amp;ldquo;en passant&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, watch the Epic engagement in crypto for details.
This is problematic:
Metaverse and production in it takes resources from the real world, but does not produce value for the real world.
The real world is getting poorer, but that is where we live.
What does that mean long term for the creation of value and money?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time Netflix launched its streaming service, much of Hollywood knew that the future of television was online (IP TV had been deployed in the late 1999s). The challenge was timing and how to package such a service (it took another 10 years for Hollywood to accept all of their channels, genres and content needs to be collapsed into a single app/brand).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ball writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persistent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synchronous and live.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be without any cap to concurrent users, while also providing each user with an individual sense of “presence”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be a fully functioning economy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be an experience that spans both the digital and physical worlds, private and public networks/experiences, and open and closed platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offer unprecedented interoperability of data, digital items/assets, content, and so on across each of these experiences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be populated by “content” and “experiences” created and operated by an incredibly wide range of contributors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Metaverse is not…&lt;/p&gt;

That&amp;rsquo;s still a long road to travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My VR goggles are sitting around, idle (sold the Oculus because mandatory FB account).
That is, because &amp;ldquo;entering VR&amp;rdquo; is an act (set things up, calibrate), and the goggles isolate (when I put them on, I am &amp;ldquo;gone&amp;rdquo;), and because it is used only by very few games.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crypto bullshit with a few good ideas, but also illusions/lies about what will happen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;1/5 of FB now working on AR&amp;rdquo;, FB looks at Metaverse as &amp;ldquo;Oculus&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;VR&amp;rdquo;. That&amp;rsquo;s dangerous tunnel vision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The &amp;ldquo;Metaverse&amp;rdquo; is a virtual space created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality, AR &amp;amp; the Internet: Our current 2D search based version of the Internet is giving way to a fully 3D immersive reality&amp;rdquo;: bullshit, unless consumption becomes casual. 3D Assets in Pancake Games are easier to sell &amp;ldquo;Cosmetics&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Metaverse is always “on” &amp;amp; is beyond the control of any individual. It exists in real time, can host any size audience, has a functioning economy, spans across platforms, provides interoperability for digital assets, &amp;amp; consists of the content and experiences its users create.&amp;rdquo; That is 2nd 2nd life as a concept, and  &amp;ldquo;3D Shoppingmalls&amp;rdquo; of the early 90ies revived. As a concept not wrong, and at the same time completely wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the Metaverse, the earning power for young creators won’t be limited to the top 1%. There will be an entire new era of young entrepreneurs making a living in virtual worlds, earning real value and steady income quicker than ever imagined.&amp;rdquo; LOL. Mainly this is about a microsoft tax, that will siphon off money from creators along the way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Creators who were once limited in their ability by technological constraints, lack of capital, time, or creativity, now have everything that is needed. What happens when physical objects are dematerialized? All formerly scarce materials become abundant.&amp;rdquo; LOL. DRM all the way is a requirement to make this work. Also, the permanent promise of creators paradise, when this is really about monopolization of the value chain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards: Thread degrades into Laser Eyes Nonsense&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital twins will act as &amp;ldquo;foundations of the metaverse&amp;rdquo; and allow people to move between real and virtual spaces&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again &amp;ldquo;2nd 2nd Life&amp;rdquo;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Skeumorphism&lt;/a&gt;

 is what we do with new tech that does not yet have its own design language. The first cars looked like coaches, and the first Apple applications mimicked Rolodexes and Moleskines. &amp;ldquo;Digital Twins&amp;rdquo; is the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core idea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2020, music artist Travis Scott staged a virtual concert inside the game that was attended live by 12.3 million people. It was a global phenomenon that sent the American rapper to the top of all music charts and earned him a reported $20 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read: &amp;ldquo;OMG, somebody has used a children&amp;rsquo;s battle royale to earn money without shooting players, but with traditional media work.&amp;rdquo;, and we are back to &amp;ldquo;all the ideas of 2nd life we know are problematic may still be valid again&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If the metaverse is an equivalent reality that coexists next to the physical reality, there needs to be a connection,&amp;rdquo; said Weir-McCall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does not need that at all. If, then more likely as AR than as 3D models, because connections to the real world is what you lose with 3D VR goggles. Casual is king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;facebook-glasshttpswwwreuterscomtechnologyfacebook-unveils-its-first-smart-glasses-2021-09-09-and-acceptance&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#facebook-glasshttpswwwreuterscomtechnologyfacebook-unveils-its-first-smart-glasses-2021-09-09-and-acceptance&#34;&gt;

 and acceptance
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Goggle were identifiable and their users vilified as glassholes.
Facebook is using Ray Bay to cover that.
There is no technical relationship between Oculus and AR.
This is about hiding the tech in the goggles to make it acceptable, and prevent a Facebook glasshole effect.
Also, AR is more casual than VR.
Fashion also allows easier re-sales of the same item, see also Apple Watch accessories.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s gonna be epic to bring the squid game to the metaverse. Salute to your team! I am a big fan of the TV series. I am super excited to have a chance to participate in this game! LFG!!!&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 20:55:51 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/10/26/metaverse.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ich &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/isotopp/status/1450739310546886657&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;schrieb auf Twitter&lt;/a&gt;

 was zum aktuellen Begriff &amp;ldquo;Metaverse&amp;rdquo;.
Das hat zu einem Kontakt mit &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/michacarl&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Michael Carl&lt;/a&gt;

 geführt, der mich in seinem &lt;a href=&#34;https://carls-zukunft.de/folge-58-how-to-build-a-metaversum-in-three-simple-steps/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Podcast&lt;/a&gt;

 haben wollte.
Meine &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_OIl_bcrjVczLQrMrVnt5IoYbitp1504mb2GbQK0EM4/edit#heading=h.wbe6wnc7fg59&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Gesprächsnotizen und Vorbereitung&lt;/a&gt;

 habe ich nun auch hier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;metaverse&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#metaverse&#34;&gt;
	Metaverse
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Begriff &amp;ldquo;Metaverse&amp;rdquo; stammt ursprünglich von Neal Stephenson, aus dem Jahre 1992, aber er ist im aktuellen Kontext von Matthew Ball in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Metaverse: What It Is, Where to Find it, Who Will Build It, and Fortnite&lt;/a&gt;

 mit Sinn gefüllt worden. Ball hat dann später &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.matthewball.vc/the-metaverse&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;mehr zum Thema&lt;/a&gt;

 geschrieben, und so den aktuellen Silicon Valley Hype erzeugt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Überlegung beginnt mit Spielen, die nicht mehr sind, was sie mal waren, sondern irgendwie mehr geworden sind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fortnite von Epic Games, in der nun auch Nicht-Fortnite-Aktivitäten stattfinden,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roblox, eine Plattform zur spielerischen Generierung von Computerspielen, und&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minecraft in der Java- und der Bedrock-Edition, um zu zeigen, wie beides auf seine Weise unternehmerische Fehlschläge sind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fortnite&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#fortnite&#34;&gt;
	Fortnite
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortnite war mal Battle Royale, aber ist inzwischen auch eine &amp;ldquo;Veranstaltungsplattform&amp;rdquo;, man kann dort Skins kaufen, Partnerschaften mit anderem IP, zum Beispiel Marvel/DC Super Heroes.
Leute haben dort Konzerte gegeben oder andere Veranstaltungen durchgeführt.
Epic unterstützt das, recht offen, weil es Fortnite so auch bei Leuten bekannt macht, die an Battle Royal und Gamer-Kultur nicht primär interessiert sind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epic Games macht auch die Unreal Engine, und die dazu gehörenden Pipelines zum Erstellen und Editieren von digitalen Game-Assets, betreibt einen Markt für diese Dinge und baut auch sonst eine lebendige Infrastruktur zur Spielerzeugung und zur Vermarktung auf.
Gewissermaßen ist dies die unsichtbare &amp;ldquo;Rückseite&amp;rdquo; von Spielen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;roblox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#roblox&#34;&gt;
	Roblox
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ganz ähnlich, aber viel mehr casual betreibt Roblox sowieso eine Plattform zur Erzeugung von Spielen, und macht so Assets, aber auch einen Markt für Assets.
Roblox ist vor allen Dingen bei jungen und sehr jungen Menschen populär, und wird bei älteren Menschen weit unterschätzt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;minecraft-in-zwei-geschmacksrichtungen&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#minecraft-in-zwei-geschmacksrichtungen&#34;&gt;
	Minecraft in zwei Geschmacksrichtungen
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minecraft ist ein Klassiker: Das originale Minecraft ist in Java geschrieben und inzwischen komplett durch Komponenten von Drittherstellern ersetzbar. Es gibt alternative Clients, alternative Server, alternative Assets.
Das Spiel ist schlecht: Es ist eine Sandbox ohne viel Story und ohne Spielziel mit primitiver Grafik, die originalen Server sind langsam und fehlerhaft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aber die Grafik ist simpel, sodass das Spiel auch auf abgelegten Kartoffelcomputern funktioniert.
Es ist alles in Java geschrieben, das sich leicht reversen und dann unkooperativ erweitern lässt, und so gibt es eine reichhaltige Community mit Moddern, Server- und Client-Plugins, und vielen anderen Erweiterungen.
Das macht das Spiel populär und zu einer &amp;ldquo;Einstiegsdroge&amp;rdquo; in die Java-Programmierung bei jungen Menschen, weil es ein unglaubliches Potenzial für Selbstmotivation bietet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nichts davon ist durch den derzeitigen Eigentümer Microsoft monetarisierbar.
Als IP ist Minecraft für Microsoft gescheitert, weil Microsoft nach dem Kauf des Spiels nicht mehr Teil der Verwertungskette ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daher gibt es von Microsoft &amp;ldquo;Minecraft Bedrock Edition&amp;rdquo;, performanter und besser designt, und von Grund auf mit einem Asset-Markt integriert.
Erweiterungen für Bedrock sind im Laden kaufbar, und nur dort.
Man muss als Anbieter IP von Microsoft lizenzieren und dann Prozente zahlen, als Kunde sowieso.
Bei den Spielern ist es deswegen kaum populär, steril und ohne eigene Kultur.
Im Vergleich zu Java Edition noch ein größerer Fehlschlag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das Bedrock-Modell ist vergleichbar mit dem Apple Entwicklermodell, aber kleiner im Scope:
Man kann nicht ernsthaft für Apple entwickeln ohne Apple-ID, Entwickler-Lizenz, Cloud-Nutzung für Handover und Storage und ohne Prozente im Apple Store zu bezahlen.
Bedrock ist danach modelliert, aber halt kein Computer-Tablet-ökosystem, sondern nur ein Spiel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;metaverse-eine-erste-definition&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#metaverse-eine-erste-definition&#34;&gt;
	Metaverse: Eine erste Definition
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die tatsächliche Definition von &amp;ldquo;Metaverse&amp;rdquo; sind also nicht 3D-Brillen, sondern &amp;ldquo;die Integration der Computerspieleindustrie mit der Wertschöpfungskette der Unterhaltungsindustrie für einen offenen, digitalen Assetmarkt&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oder offener: Das Anzapfen der Spieleverwertungskette an jeder Stelle im Produktionsfluß, und das Aufwerten der Spieleverwertungskette durch Integration mit Intellectual Property aus Filmen und Büchern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es geht also darum, aus dem Lebenszeit-Konsum-Budget einer Person mehr Geld herauszuziehen, ohne zu viel Lebenszeit bei dieser Person zu verbrauchen, also um eine Aufweitung von Ausgaben für &amp;ldquo;Medien&amp;rdquo; im aller weitesten Sinne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;budgets-für-aufmerksamkeit-und-geld&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#budgets-f%c3%bcr-aufmerksamkeit-und-geld&#34;&gt;
	Budgets für Aufmerksamkeit und Geld
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Menschen haben Geldlimits für ihre Freizeit, der &lt;a href=&#34;https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verf%C3%BCgbares_Einkommen&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Konsumanteil des verfügbaren Einkommens&lt;/a&gt;

.
Sie haben auch Zeitlimits für ihre Freizeit, ein Budget für Aufmerksamkeit.
Beides ist konvertibel, aber das hängt am Medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nimmt man eine nützliche Lebenszeit, in der ich &amp;ldquo;Lesen&amp;rdquo; kann von 60 Jahren an, und unterstellt man einem fleißigen Leser 40 Bücher (eines pro Woche) im Jahr, dann wird diese Person in ihrem Leben 2400 Bücher lesen, im Wert von sagen wir ~30 Euro pro Stück.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arbeitet man mit Computerspielen der AAA-Klasse, dann schafft man eventuell 4-6 Spiele im Jahr sinnvoll durchzuspielen, also im Leben 240-300 Titel, im Wert von ~60 Euro pro Stück.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das setzt eine Größenordnung von Lebensumsatz pro Person für diese Dinge, also ~70k Euro in Büchern oder 20k Euro in Spielen pro Personenleben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir sehen insbesondere, daß Spiele im Vergleich zu ihrem Produktionsaufwand viel zu billig sind, aber ein höherer Preis als 60 Euro ist auch für einen AAA-Titel nicht durchsetzbar.
Das ist einer der Gründe, warum in jedem einzelnen dieser Spiele weitere Möglichkeiten zum Geldausgeben enthalten sind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generell ist es aber bei beiden Medien so, daß das Geldausgeben im Vergleich zu der aufgewendeten Zeit zu langsam ist:
Die Burnrate muss hoch.
Bücher, aber auch Filme und insbesondere AAA-Titel von Computerspielen sind viel zu werthaltig, und ihr Konsum ist zu aufwendig.
Wir suchen was anderes, bei dem nicht so viele Minuten Lebenszeit pro ausgegebenem Euro aufgewendet werden müsse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist kritisch, weil es ja auch noch viele freie Inhalte gibt, die auch um Aufmerksamkeit buhlen und &amp;ldquo;gut genug&amp;rdquo; sind, um bezahlte Inhalte zu verdrängen.
Sie kosten Minuten Aufmerksamkeit, ohne Geld zu verdienen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nebenschauplatz-sterben-und-erben&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#nebenschauplatz-sterben-und-erben&#34;&gt;
	Nebenschauplatz: Sterben und Erben
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angesichts der alternden Bevölkerung gibt es auch noch den Nebenschauplatz &amp;ldquo;Boomer sterben, Kinder erben&amp;rdquo;.
Ich habe zum Beispiel genau jetzt ca. 600 Steam Titel und 1000 Kindle Books.
Wenn ich sterbe, sind das einige 10k Euro Wert.
Wie vererbe ich die meinem Sohn?
Die Politik hat keine Antworten, und die Hersteller lassen das nicht zu.
Ich kann meinem Kind also nur mein Steam Login vermachen und von meinen Kindle-Büchern das DRM knacken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wirtschaftlich sind Kindle und Steam-Erbschaften für die Hersteller weitgehend irrelevant, oder wären sogar positiv, und es ist unklar, wieso man sich so sträubt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn ein Haus am See erbe, kann ich da hereingehen, die Veranda aufschließen, in den Park gehen und so das Asset genießen.
Das kostet mich nicht viel Zeit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erbe ich dagegen eine Kindle- oder Steam-Library, kostet mich das viel Zeit in der Erschließung:
Wenn ich 1200 Bücher erbe, sind das 30 Jahre Lebenszeit, die ich investieren muss, um das Erbe zu verarbeiten.
Wenn ich 1000 Spiele erbe, sind da Titel von 2002 bei, die heute wie Dreck aussehen.
Ich erbe &amp;ldquo;Skyrim&amp;rdquo;, muss aber &amp;ldquo;Skyrim VR&amp;rdquo; und &amp;ldquo;Skyrim Remastered&amp;rdquo; selbst kaufen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir sehen sofort: Erben ist für den Hersteller kein relevanter Umsatzverlust, sondern eher noch ein Mittel zur Verkaufsförderung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;assets-hoher-geldaufwand-geringer-zeitaufwand&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#assets-hoher-geldaufwand-geringer-zeitaufwand&#34;&gt;
	Assets: hoher Geldaufwand, geringer Zeitaufwand
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bereits heute ist in Spielen neben Lootboxen und Pay-to-Win und Pay-to-Skip Modellen der Verkauf von Cosmetics eine der größten Einnahmequellen, und im Gegensatz zu den anderen Geldquellen weitgehend unumstritten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay-to-Win: Das Spiel ist nicht erfolgreich zu beenden, außer man kauft Ausrüstungsgegenstände für Echtgeld dazu. Idealerweise wird das erst sichtbar, wenn man bereits eine Menge Zeit und Emotion in das Spiel investiert hat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay-to-Skip: Das Spiel wird immer wieder durch ärgerliche Wartepausen unterbrochen, in denen man nicht weiterspielen kann, außer man kauft die Pause durch Echtgeld weg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lootboxen: Das Spiel verkauft einem Container einem zufälligen Inhalt an Spielgegenständen, bei denen selten wertvolle Dinge enthalten sind. Das eigentliche Spiel ist also eine Verpackung für ein Glücksspiel im Inneren. Diese Praxis ist mittlerweile in einigen EU-Ländern verboten.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Im Gegensatz dazu sind Cosmetics weitgehend unumstritten: Das sind Gegenstände, die der Spielfigur und ihrer Ausrüstung ein anderes Aussehen geben, ein virtuelles Haus und seine Einrichtung, die auf das Spiel keine wesentliche Auswirkung haben und ähnliches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Im Spiel &amp;ldquo;Elder Scrolls Online&amp;rdquo; zum Beispiel bekommt man als Spieler leicht und zu geringen Kosten virtuelle Wohnhäuser in der Spielwelt, die sehr spektakulär liegen und aussehen und viel leeren Platz bieten.
Gegenstände zum Einrichten kann man sich als Trophäen erspielen, aber wesentliche Alltagsgegenstände zur Einrichtung sind nur via Echtgeld-Einsatz im Shop zu kaufen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das für den Hersteller wunderbare dabei:
Der Spieler kann in den Kauf von Cosmetics beliebig viel Geld reinpumpen und wird dabei kaum Lebenszeit oder Aufmerksamkeit aufbringen müssen.
Limitierend kann also nur die Geldbörse des Kunden wirken, nicht aber sein Zeitbudget.
Das macht so etwas zu einem viel besseren Geschäftsfeld als Bücher, Filme oder die Spiele selbst.
Das Spiel liefert nur den Kontext und Anlass für die Cosmetics zu existieren und bestimmt ihr Aussehen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epic-games&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#epic-games&#34;&gt;
	Epic Games
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dies ist genau die Geschäftsgrundlage von Epic Games:
Mit der Unreal Engine bietet die Firma eine Plattform zum schnellen und effizienten Design von sehr gut aussehenden Videospielen.
Dazu gehören auch Werkzeuge zum Erzeugen der Ingame-Assets, aber auch der Betrieb einer Verkaufsplattform für solche Assets an Spielhersteller.
Mit dem Epic Launcher und dem darin integrierten Shop auch eine Plattform zum Verkauf von Spielen, und zum Erfassen von Meta- und Nutzungsdaten an Epic, die dann wiederum (gegen Geld) dem Spielhersteller als Analytics angeboten werden.
Das von Epic betriebene Payment-System ist die Pipeline, über die Geld vom Kunden zum Spielhersteller fließen kann, und über die nicht nur die Spiele, sondern auch Erweiterungen, In-Game Käufe und andere Geldausgaben abgewickelt werden können.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mit Fortnite hat man aber auch ein eigenes Spiel am Start, das zugleich auch 3D Assets an Endkunden als Ausrüstungsgegenstände, Cosmetics oder sonst wie verkaufen kann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortnite ist eine bestimmte Sorte Spiel - Player vs. Player, im Battle Royal Modus, Spieler treten gegeneinander an und der letzte Überlebende gewinnt.
Diese Sorte Spiel ist nicht für alle Zielgruppen interessant, aber die Engine von Fortnite lässt sich auch anderweitig nutzen.
Entsprechend weckt man Interesse durch Nutzung von Fortnite als &amp;ldquo;virtuelle Veranstaltungsplattform&amp;rdquo; und hält das Interesse durch Media Tie-Ins und Licensed IP aufrecht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Interpretation von Metaverse als Verwertungskette von digitalen Assets, speziell 3D Assets, als &amp;ldquo;Online-Merchandise&amp;rdquo; greift jedoch zu kurz:
Als Ökosystem mit einer kontrollierten Anzahl von großen Marktbetreibern und einer großen Anzahl von Kunden und Kreativen steht man viel besser und vor allen Dingen dauerhafter da.
Man kann Dritten auf diese Weise erlauben, untereinander Handel zu treiben, aber dabei laufend einen geringen Anteil an allen Transaktionen abgreifen.
Gewissermaßen will man die Idee der &amp;ldquo;Microsoft-Tax&amp;rdquo; in einem anderen Kontext wieder aufleben lassen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unterschiedliche Ausgangspositionen bei&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Epic Games/Fortnite - schwach bei IP, aber original IP, wenn auch Nische, Unreal Engine und die anderen Dinge auf der &amp;ldquo;Rückseite&amp;rdquo; der Spiele als große Stärke.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roblox - original IP, sehr junge Kundschaft, erzieht sich gerade Kinder, 10 Jahre warten, groß unterschätzt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft - Minecraft, MS Store et al, zu Enterprise um erfolgreich zu sein? Aber Halo, MSFS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple (sic!) - kein IP, aber Plattform/Kette.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disney (sic!) - nur IP, aber schwach in Verwertung außerhalb von Filmen/offline Merchandise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook - will da unbedingt rein, &amp;ldquo;Enterprise Pivot&amp;rdquo;: wenn Social in Zukunft &amp;ldquo;hier&amp;rdquo; stattfindet, dann muss Facebook &amp;ldquo;hier&amp;rdquo; sein.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google - insbesondere der Grund, wieso Google Stadia nicht wirklich einstellen kann, selbst wenn es ein Flop wird/ist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon - hier ist auch die Spiele Strategie von Amazon mit einordnen. Amazon wäre gerne das AWS der Spielewelt anstelle von Epic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

 als Market Maturity Model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir sind derzeit in einer chaotischen Phase der Marktentwicklung:
Niemand hat ein Geschäftsmodell in diesem Markt, es ist unklar, wie dieser überhaupt aussehen wird.
Standards existieren noch nicht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es geht um Landgrab, also um den Aufbau von Marktanteilen in einem entstehenden und wachsenden Markt.
Interop ist sekundär, weil noch keine Idee vorhanden ist, wie die Standards aussehen werden.
Man versucht sich vom Mitbewerb durch Features zu differenzieren, und dabei auch herauszufinden, was wichtig ist.
Alle Spieler wachsen in einem wachsenden, entstehenden Markt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sobald es ein Geschäftsmodell, stabile Featurelisten und ein System zur Geldextraktion gibt, wird sich der Markt konsolidieren.
Dann beherrschen 3-5 Firmen den Markt, der auch aus dem Hyperwachstum heraus geht.
Die marktbeherrschenden Firmen erkennen einander an und konkurrieren semi-kooperativ miteinander:
Es ist wichtiger, den Marktzugang von Disruptoren zu erschweren, und es wird komplexe, schwierig zu implementierende Standards geben, mit Compliance Prüfungen und anderen Kostenfaktoren.
Das wird dann aber auch - zähneknirschend - zu Interoperabilität führen.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#metaverse-%c3%bcberarbeitete-definition&#34;&gt;
	Metaverse, überarbeitete Definition
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das führt uns zur überarbeiteten Definition von Metaverse:
Die Integration der Spieleindustrie mit der Unterhaltungsindustrie und die Integration der Wertschöpfungsketten, mit der Möglichkeit die Verwertungskette an jeder Stelle im Produktionsfluß mit einer Art Steuer zu belegen.
Ein systematisches Anzapfen des Lifetime Intellectual Property-Konsumbudgets einer Person, und die Aufweitung des Marktes, der für einen Konsumenten relevant ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Erkenntnis, daß Buch, Filme und Spiele zu zeitaufwendig zu erstellen und zu konsumieren sind.
3D Assets ist viel größere Verkaufsgelegenheit, ohne daß der Kunde so viel Lebenszeit investieren muss, um tatsächlich den Kauf zu konsumieren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vor diesem Hintergrund ist auch die laufende Auseinandersetzung von Epic vs. Apple und Google vor Gericht zu lesen: Es geht darum, das Anzapf-Monopol von Apple und den von Apple dominierten Markt für andere zu Öffnen zu unterminieren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besondere deutsche Probleme dabei:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keine Infrastruktur für Highspeed, Low Latency wie man das für Spiele braucht.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keine deutsche Firma mit nennenswerter Identity Plattform (web.de? T-Online? &amp;ldquo;Login mit x&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keine deutschen Ressourcen im 3D-Asset Tooling, Produktion, &amp;hellip; Markt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keine deutsche Film/Fernseh/Lit Industrie zur Produktion von IP, Stories, die weltweit wiedererkennbare Kultur prägen, die man verkaufen kann.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deutscher Blick geht nach innen, ins eigene Land, nicht auf einen Weltmarkt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vergleiche dabei Korea: koreanische Produktionsketten in K-Pop; die &amp;ldquo;cultural technology&amp;rdquo; die andere Stile und Kunstrichtungen aufgreift und in K-Pop integriert; Produktionspipelines für Stars und Sternchen, aber auch für IP (beginnend).
Im Vergleich ist Deutschland essenziell wehrlos und angehängt.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das &amp;ldquo;Eigentum&amp;rdquo; in einer simulierten Realität sieht aus wie Eigentum, ist aber virtuell und kopierbar.
Es kommt im virtuellen zur einer Entfernung von Ressourcenknappheit bei der Produktion, aber &amp;ldquo;Wert&amp;rdquo; entsteht nur, wenn die Ware künstlich verknappt wird beim Konsum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Zollhaus-Stellen, Plattformbetreiber haben volle Markttransparenz, und können das Freizeit-Konsumverhalten jeder Person genau ausmessen.
Sie wissen, was Du siehst und hörst, was Du benutzt, welche Stile Dir zusagen und können diese Information gegen Geld an Kreative verkaufen, und verkaufen den Kreativen auch gegen Geld den Zugang zu Dir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein Freund von mir:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nur ein halber Witz: man muss in Zukunft bei Geburt eines Kindes als Erstes entscheiden muss, ob es Apple-, Google- oder Facebook-Angehöriger wird und der Name erst danach entsprechend den Regeln des Dienstes festgelegt wird. Wechsel zwischen den Services ist dann komplex wie eine Emigration nach Nordkorea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zentraler Bestandteil bezüglich der Verknappung auch DRM, hier unter dem Modenamen &amp;ldquo;NFT&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;NFT&amp;rdquo; ist das Blockchain Wort für DRM, nur zusätzlich mit Umweltvergiftung durch Energieverschwendung.
Unikate gibt es nur mit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rechner zunageln,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TPM,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in-game nur lizenzierte Assets und Mods verwendbar, und&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NFT Laser Eyes Kryptoscheisse, die den Planeten verbrennt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In diesem Kontext ist auch das aktuelle Engagement von Epic im NFT Misthaufen zu lesen sehen.
Daher: korrekte Standards sind wichtig, und Identität ist die Grundlage für &amp;ldquo;Eigentum&amp;rdquo;.
Das braucht nicht nur keine Blockchain, es funktioniert auch besser ohne - die Plattformen sind eh zentral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Freund kommentiert wieder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es geht darum, dass die Leute aus dem Universum nicht rauskommen können (Stichwort: Hyperinklusion).
Sie kaufen in Metaverse-Shops, daten ihre Partner in Metaverse-Locations, sehen nur noch Werbung für im Metaverse verfügbare Waren, können Metaverse-kritische Gedanken kaum noch formulieren.
Es gibt keinen Public-Space mehr im Leben, alles ist Teil der gated community (Vgl. Verlust der Almende).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Du hast vielleicht noch einen Wettbewerb zwischen x Metaversen, aber innerhalb eines Metaversums gibt es dann einen oder nur noch einen gesteuerten Wettbewerb.
D.h. das Metaversum monopolisiert den Menschen in seiner Gesamtheit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist ein bisschen wie die Minenstädte in den USA Ende des 19. Jhd.
Der Shop gehörte der Mine, der Pfarrer arbeitete für die Mine, die Mine stellte Sheriff und Bürgermeister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effektiv will FB durch das Metaversum ihr gegenwärtiges Social-Media-Monopol verewigen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das führt thematisch zur Geldtheorie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;currency&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#currency&#34;&gt;
	Currency
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durch die CryptoCurrencies ist für die großen jetzt klar, dass die Geldschöpfung &amp;ldquo;up for the grabs&amp;rdquo; ist. Ein Metaversum wäre der perfekte Ansatz das &amp;ldquo;en passant&amp;rdquo; zu realisieren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An dieser Stelle kommt dann gleich wieder das Epic Engagement bei &amp;ldquo;Cryptocurrentcies&amp;rdquo; zum Tragen.
Das ist sehr problematisch:
Metaversum und Produktion dort nimmt nur Ressourcen aus der realen Welt, produziert dort aber nicht.
Am Ende wird die reale Welt ärmer, dort leben wir aber.
Was heißt das langfristig für Wertschöpfung und Geld?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;material&#34;&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Einzelne Firmen weiter (Liste oben), Cynefin Complex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alle Firmen unvollständig aufgestellt. Akquise schwierig, wen kaufen? Und die zu kaufenden Firmen sind selbst noch nicht fertig: Integration auch schwierig.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;rdquo;, Videospiele Growth Manager, ein Bericht. Richtige Richtung, zu kurz, erklärt aber die Kette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Im Gegensatz zu einem typischen Videospiel, bei dem man versucht, so viele Leute wie möglich dazu zu bringen, einmalig 60 Dollar für ein Spiel auszugeben, will ein Free-to-Play Spiel so viele Leute wie möglich zum Spielen zu animieren. Sobald sie spielen, bemüht sich das Unternehmen, so viele digitale Güter wie möglich an sie zu verkaufen. Es gibt zwar eine Obergrenze dafür, wie viel man für ein Spiel verlangen kann, aber es gibt keine Obergrenze für die Zahl an sinnlosen digitalen Tokens, die man verhökern kann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metaverse: Industrialisiere diesen Prozess und mainstreame ihn. Aspekte: Spielen nach Termin, Pay to Skip, Pay to Win.&lt;/p&gt;

Ungesund für beide Seiten, macht das Spiel schnell zu einem Spiel für wenige Vielzahler, und damit langfristig global schlecht; besondere Herausforderung beim Produktmanagement.&lt;/p&gt;

: Original Metaverse Article&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medienseite:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time Netflix launched its streaming service, much of Hollywood knew that the future of television was online (IP TV had been deployed in the late 1999s). The challenge was timing and how to package such a service (it took another 10 years for Hollywood to accept all of their channels, genres and content needs to be collapsed into a single app/brand).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ball schreibt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Metaverse, we think, will be &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persistent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synchronous and live.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be without any cap to concurrent users, while also providing each user with an individual sense of “presence”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be a fully functioning economy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be an experience that spans both the digital and physical worlds, private and public networks/experiences, and open and closed platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offer unprecedented interoperability of data, digital items/assets, content, and so on across each of these experiences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be populated by “content” and “experiences” created and operated by an incredibly wide range of contributors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Metaverse is not…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A “virtual world”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A “virtual space”  (2nd life)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Virtual reality”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A “digital and virtual economy”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &amp;ldquo;game&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A “virtual theme park or Disneyland”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A “new app store”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A “new UGC platform”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist natürlich Unsinn, es wird alle diese Dinge &lt;em&gt;auch&lt;/em&gt; sein.
Das ist alles Valley Hype, um The Next Internet als Begriff zu etablieren und eine gemeinsame Erzählung zu haben.
Aber am Ende ist geht es genau um diese 8 Dinge die es angeblich NICHT sein soll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Es geht darum, User Engagement zu erhalten.
Das Problem muss jedes MMO lösen, denn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Die Leute leben nicht im Metaverse, die leben hier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Primärer Konsum ist Casual, nicht High End Gamer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Das ist die Schwachstelle des Konzeptes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erst wenn das Ding zu einem ständigen Ort wird, kann es ein Metaversum werden.
Das ist noch ein langer Weg:
Meine VR-Brille steht hier ungenutzt rum (Oculus verkauft, wegen FB Zwang).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist so, weil &amp;ldquo;in VR zu gehen&amp;rdquo; ein Akt ist (aufbauen, kalibrieren), und die Brille isoliert (ich bin dann weg), und weil es nicht viele Spiele gibt, die das sinnvoll nutzen (Elite Dangerous, MSFS-2020, Moss, selten auch Space Pirate Trainer).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crypto Dummlall mit einigen guten Ideen, aber Illusionen über wie es laufen wird&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;1/5 of Facebook now working on AR&amp;rdquo;, für FB ist das Metaverse zur Zeit &amp;ldquo;Oculus&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;VR&amp;rdquo;. Das ist ein gefährlicher Tunnelblick (siehe oben &amp;ldquo;casual&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The &amp;ldquo;Metaverse&amp;rdquo; is a virtual space created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality, AR &amp;amp; the internet: Our current 2D search based version of the internet is giving way to a fully 3D immersive reality&amp;rdquo;: Das ist Quatsch, solange 3D nicht komplett Casual konsumierbar wird, und eine 3D Brille ist derzeit isolierend, schwer und verkabelt. 3D Assets in Pancake Games sind leichter und direkt zu verkaufen, jetzt. &amp;ldquo;Cosmetics&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Metaverse is always “on” &amp;amp; is beyond the control of any individual. It exists in real time, can host any size audience, has a functioning economy, spans across platforms, provides interoperability for digital assets, &amp;amp; consists of the content and experiences its users create.&amp;rdquo; Das Konzept 2nd 2nd Life, und die &amp;ldquo;3D Shoppingmalls&amp;rdquo; der frühen 90er feiern fröhliche Urständ, als Konzept nicht falsch und gleichzeitig total falsch. 3D Events, die Presence ersetzen sind interessant, aber super hart.
Auch hier Korean Cultural Technology, K-POP Konsum während COVID-19 (Pancake, large Audiences, Gemeinschaftserlebnisse, &amp;ldquo;VR&amp;rdquo; Nebensache)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the Metaverse, the earning power for young creators won’t be limited to the top 1%. There will be an entire new era of young entrepreneurs making a living in virtual worlds, earning real value and steady income quicker than ever imagined.&amp;rdquo; LOL. In erster Linie geht es um Zollhäuschen entlang der Verwertungskette, mit dem durch Creators erschaffenen Mehrwert als Motor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Creators who were once limited in their ability by technological constraints, lack of capital, time, or creativity, now have everything that is needed. What happens when physical objects are dematerialized? All formerly scarce materials become abundant.&amp;rdquo; LOL. DRM all the way ist notwendig, damit das funktioniert. Außerdem das Dauerversprechen vom Creators Paradise, wenn es tatsächlich um Monopolisierung der Wertschöpfungskette geht.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danach: Thread degrades in Laser Eyes Nonsense&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital twins will act as &amp;ldquo;foundations of the metaverse&amp;rdquo; and allow people to move between real and virtual spaces&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist &amp;ldquo;2nd 2nd Life&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Skeumorphism&lt;/a&gt;

 ist, was wir machen, wenn wir noch nicht wissen, was die Design Language für eine neue Welt ist. Die ersten Autos sagen aus wie Kutschen, die ersten Apple Anwendungen haben Rolodexe und Moleskine imitiert. &amp;ldquo;Digital Twins&amp;rdquo; sind dasselbe Konzept, aber für ein Metaversum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Und die Kernidee:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2020, music artist Travis Scott staged a virtual concert inside the game that was attended live by 12.3 million people. It was a global phenomenon that sent the American rapper to the top of all music charts and earned him a reported $20 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lies: &amp;ldquo;OMG, jemand hat in einem Kinder-Battle Royale Spiel Geld verdient ohne zu metzeln, sondern mit traditioneller Medienarbeit&amp;rdquo; führt sofort zu &amp;ldquo;Alle Ideen von 2nd Life, von denen wir schon wissen, dass sie problematisch sind, feiern Wiederauferstehung.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If the metaverse is an equivalent reality that coexists next to the physical reality, there needs to be a connection,&amp;rdquo; said Weir-McCall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ist es nicht, muss es nicht. Wenn es dann doch muss, eventuell eher AR als 3D-Modelle, denn Connection zur realen Welt hat man mit einer vollen VR-Brille eben nicht. Was ich oben über Casual Konsum sage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mein Freund merkt an:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital Twins / Digital Shadows sind übrigens auch Begriffe um den die Datenspur von Leuten zu bezeichnen.
Der Gesundheitsbereich versucht das ebenso zu etablieren, um anhand dieser Zwillinge Diagnostik betreiben zu können.
Das wird auch noch einmal spannend, wie das mit dem Metaverse verbunden wird.
Gerade aus Facebooks Sicht - welche Daten kann das Metaversum aus Deinem Avatar auslesen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;facebook-glasshttpswwwreuterscomtechnologyfacebook-unveils-its-first-smart-glasses-2021-09-09-und-akzeptanz&#34;&gt;

 und Akzeptanz
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bei Google Brille waren die Träger erkennbar, der Begriff Glassholes entstand.
Mit Ray Ban ist das besser zu tarnen.
Ray Ban hat keinen technischen Beitrag zu Oculus und AR, es geht nur darum, den Markennamen und das Design als Tarnung für Oculus zu nehmen, um den Google Glass Effect zu vermeiden.
Außerdem ist AR mehr Casual als VR.
Mode erlaubt auch einfacheren Neuverkauf, siehe auch Apple Watch Zubehör.&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 21:38:44 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/10/01/projektschmerzen.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Es beginnt mit &lt;a href=&#34;https://mobile.twitter.com/HonkHase/status/1443623907064492035&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;einem Tweet von Manuel Atug&lt;/a&gt;

:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wegen Überlastung der Server: #Notruf-App vorerst nicht mehr in App-Stores&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;und der Tweet verlinkte einen (inzwischen nicht mehr existierenden) Artikel beim Deutschlandfunk.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mobile.twitter.com/hikhvar/status/1443835052413104144&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Christoph Petrausch&lt;/a&gt;

 erklärt, wie solche Projekte falsch laufen können:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sowas erfordert eine Fehlerkultur. Du musst als Organisation in der Lage sein, nach so einem Incident einen Schritt zurückzutreten.
Alle Fakten auf den Tisch zu legen und zu fragen:
Warum kam es dazu?
Wo liegen die Probleme?
Und daraus musst du dann für das nächste Mal lernen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Und das ist sehr schwer, wenn du in einem Konglomerat aus Dienstleister und Konsortien sitzt.
Da sind nämlich Verträge und Vertragsstrafen im Weg.
Wenn der Dienstleister sagt: &amp;ldquo;Yes, da haben wir nicht nach State auf the Art gearbeitet&amp;rdquo;, kommt gleich der Anwalt vom Auftraggeber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;it-projekte&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#it-projekte&#34;&gt;
	IT-Projekte
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ich &lt;a href=&#34;https://mobile.twitter.com/isotopp/status/1443847331355504690&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;schrieb dazu&lt;/a&gt;

:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christoph Petrausch schneidet hier ein weiteres sehr unangenehmes Thema an:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn man mit mehreren externen Dienstleistern arbeitet, dann ist es auf viele Weisen schwieriger einen Projekterfolg zu haben.
Denn der Dienstleister arbeitet nicht für den Projekterfolg, sondern primär für den Vertrag.
Das muss er tun, um sich abzusichern, aus den von Christoph genannten Gründen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ändern sich die Anforderungen des Projekts oder sind in Teilprojektphasen Learnings aufgetaucht, die man in den folgenden Projektphasen einfließen lassen möchte, dann ist das alles schwierig.
Denn Nachsteuern ist dann eine Vertragsänderung, mindestens eine Anpassung des Statement of Work.
Wahrscheinlich wird man jedoch auch das Finanzielle nachregeln müssen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das Projekt wird dadurch schwieriger steuerbar und langsamer, weil jede Anpassung auf einmal ein Verwaltungsakt ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generell steigen die Projektrisiken mit jeder administrativen Grenze überproportional an:
hier mein Amt, dort Dein Dienstleister.
Das ist so, weil sich Verzögerungen auf dem Dienstweg, Nachrichtenverfälschungen durch Stille Post und dergleichen mehr akkumulieren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mit einer steigenden Anzahl von Projektpartnern (&amp;ldquo;administrativen Einheiten&amp;rdquo;) steigen auch die Kommunikationsbeziehungen, der Verhandlungsbedarf und die auszugleichenden Interessen an: (n * (n-1)/2 → n^2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2021/10/kommunikations-explosion.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anzahl der Kommunikationsbeziehungen bei 3 (3), 4 (6), 5 (10) und 6 (15) Projektpartnern.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist einer der Hauptgründe für Kostenexplosionen und Verzögerungen bei solchen Projekten:
Vertragsstrukturen und Kommunikations- und Verhandlungsaufwand machen es schwer, die Ziele aller Projektbeteiligten kohärent zu halten und das Projekt schnell auf geänderte Anforderungen anzupassen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bärcode&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#b%c3%a4rcode&#34;&gt;
	Bärcode
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nun mache ich diese IT-Sache schon mehr als 35 Jahre, und dort ist es meiner Erfahrung nach &lt;em&gt;immer&lt;/em&gt; so, daß sich die Anforderungen im Laufe des Projektes ändern und man dann das Projekt anpassen muss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://baercode.de&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selbst bei so simplen Sachen wie &lt;a href=&#34;https://baercode.de&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;baercode.de&lt;/a&gt;

, den ich ehrenamtlich beratend begleitet habe, und die technisch korrekt und im Zeit- und Kostenbudget waren ist es so, daß die zusammenbrechende Kontrollpraxis zeigt, daß man einen wirksamen Test- und Covid-Pass eigentlich grundsätzlich anders gestalten muss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In einer weiteren Iteration (die nicht geplant ist) würde man grundsätzlich und viel aufwendiger an das Problem herangehen müssen.
Das ist aber etwas, das zum Zeitpunkt des Requirement Engineerings nicht absehbar war.
Es wäre auch nicht durchsetzbar gewesen, hätte jemand zu diesem Zeitpunkt damals die Anforderung eingebracht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;experiment-early&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#experiment-early&#34;&gt;
	Experiment early
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In meinem Hauptberuf ist es so, daß mein Arbeitgeber deswegen unfertige Features so schnell als möglich in der Produktion testet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2021/10/8-rollouts-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slideshare &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.slideshare.net/isotopp/8-rollouts-a-day#19&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;8 Rollouts a Day&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es geht darum, die Requirements zu validieren. &amp;ldquo;Ist diese Idee wirklich geeignet, das Problem zu lösen?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Als Webanwendung und als Anwendung, die nicht mit hoheitlichen oder medizinischen Daten arbeitet, sind wir da in einer privilegierten Position.
Wir können dann mit relativ wenig Aufwand früh experimentieren, solange wir uns aus PII und PCI heraushalten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2021/10/8-rollouts-2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HIPPO: HIghest Paid Persons Opinion. Experiments kill HIPPOs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weil wir das eigentliche Feature mit so wenig Entwicklungsaufwand als möglich implementieren können wir früh sehen, welche Änderungen an der Website uns reicher machen.
19 von 20 Ideen scheitern in dieser Experimentierphase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2021/10/8-rollouts-3.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Das Experiment dient dazu, eine minimale (oder Fake-) Implementation eines Features auszumessen. Dabei ist ausschließlich interessant herauszufinden, ob die Requirements bei echten Usern überhaupt Sinn ergeben.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir wissen dann jedoch auch, &lt;em&gt;wieviel&lt;/em&gt; reicher uns so ein Feature macht, und weil das so ist, können wir den Einsatz von Entwickler-Kapazitäten viel besser steuern:
Entwickler arbeiten nur an Dingen, von denen wir wissen, daß sie Mehreinnahmen generieren, und &lt;em&gt;wieviel&lt;/em&gt; Mehreinnahmen das sind.
Wir können dann den Aufwand beim Engineering gegen den Gewinn abwägen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das geht nur im Haus. Das kann nicht outsourcen. Denn nur dann ist eine informale, enge Steuerung mit Umsetzungszeiten für Steuerungsinput im Bereich von Stunden möglich .
Tagen oder gar Wochen würden jede Form von Experimentieren scheitern lassen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;insourcing-und-outsourcing-vs-marktreife-und-prozessreife&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#insourcing-und-outsourcing-vs-marktreife-und-prozessreife&#34;&gt;
	Insourcing und Outsourcing vs. Marktreife und Prozessreife
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expertise im Haus ist wichtig, um beurteilen zu können, was Dienstleister machen. Dan Luu hat dazu einen &lt;a href=&#34;https://danluu.com/in-house/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;interessanten Artikel&lt;/a&gt;

 geschrieben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eigene Experten sind jedoch noch wichtiger, wenn man neue Dinge ausprobiert, und man deswegen das Projekt eng steuern muss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2021/10/go-away-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slideshare &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.slideshare.net/isotopp/go-away-or-i-will-replace-you-with-a-little-shell-script#12&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Go away or I will replace you with a very tiny shell script&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;rdquo;, Marktreife und Prozessreife&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist auch alles kein Hexenwerk, sondern lange bekannt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn man neue, unerprobte Dinge macht, ist man im Chaotischen Quadranten des &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Cynefin Models&lt;/a&gt;

 und macht Forschung.
Dazu braucht man eine kleine Gruppe von Experten, die sich darauf konzentriert, Regeln und Gesetzmäßigkeiten (&amp;ldquo;überhaupt Practice&amp;rdquo;) zu finden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In der deutschen Pipeline ist das ein Uni-Projekt, in dem Professor/innen irgendwelche Ideen ausprobieren, von denen die Mehrheit auf irgendeine nicht offensichtliche Weise egal oder falsch ist.
Aber das herauszufinden ist genau Sinn der Sache:
Die Mehrheit dieser Versuche scheitert, genau wie wir beim Requirements Engineering 19 von 20 Experimenten im Test scheitern sehen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Complex&amp;rdquo; ist der Engineering-Quadrant, in der wir versuchen, als funktionierend bekannte Grundideen hoch zu skalieren, und in der Masse anwendbar zu machen.
Hier braucht es mehr als ein Team, mit einem der Theoretiker aus der vorigen Phase als Beratung und vielen Praktikern (&amp;ldquo;Ingenieuren&amp;rdquo;) in den Teams, die immer noch so klein als möglich sein sollten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idealerweise hat man zwei oder drei konkurrierende Ansätze mit überlappenden Zielsetzungen, von denen dann hoffentlich einer diese Phase überlebt.
Aus dieser bekommt man dann einen Satz Handlungsanweisungen (&amp;ldquo;Wiederholbare Practice&amp;rdquo;) und gute Ratschläge (&amp;ldquo;das da ist kritisch!&amp;rdquo;). Das kann man dann schrittweise Ausrollen und mit Feinkorrekturen in die Fläche bringen.
Dabei kommen auch Dienstleister und deren Training ins Spiel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2021/10/go-away-2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prozessreife: Ohne quantitative Metriken ist Outsourcing meist zum Scheitern verurteilt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das geht halt aber erst genau dann, wenn man Prozesse &lt;em&gt;mit Metriken&lt;/em&gt; hat.
Das bedeutet: wenn man Erfahrung hat, was man messen muss und wie - auf beiden Seiten der Vertragsgrenze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn der Prozess noch nicht reif genug ist und man gar keine Metriken hat, ist Einigkeit zwischen Auftraggeber und -nehmer schwierig.
Dasselbe Problem hat man, wenn der Prozess noch zu schnell wächst, um ohne grundlegende Änderungen wiederholbar zu sein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn man - aus welchem Grund auch immer - solche Metriken nicht hat, oder nicht haben &lt;em&gt;kann&lt;/em&gt;, weil es noch nicht so weit ist, dann &lt;em&gt;kann man nicht outsourcen&lt;/em&gt;, also keinen Dienstleister verwenden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warum ist das so?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weil man gar keine Grundlage hat, auf der beide Parteien beurteilen können, was verkauft und was geliefert worden ist, und ob das so okay ist.
Solange das Projekt oder Prozess-Produkt noch weich ist, weil es noch in der Forschungs- oder Engineering-Phase ist, kann man nicht richtig sinnvoll mit externer Expertise arbeiten, weil &lt;em&gt;niemand weiß, wie es geht&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dann ist Expertise &lt;em&gt;im Haus&lt;/em&gt; absolut notwendig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blameless-postmortem&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#blameless-postmortem&#34;&gt;
	Blameless Postmortem
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian Petrausch weist noch auf einen weiteren kritischen Baustein hin, der absolut zwingend notwendig ist, und der über Vertragsgrenzen hinweg nur sehr, sehr schwierig zu realisieren ist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blameless Postmortem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn irgendwo ein Flugzeug ein Unglück hat,
wenn irgendwo ein Patient verstirbt,
wenn irgendwo in einer gut geführten Softwarefirma eine Outage war, dann setzen sich alle Gruppen zusammen und versuchen herauszufinden, wie &lt;em&gt;der Prozess&lt;/em&gt; defekt ist, der dazu geführt hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Annahme ist, daß alle Beteiligten mit den besten Absichten und im Rahmen ihrer Fähigkeiten und zum Zeitpunkt der Entscheidung verfügbaren Informationen gehandelt haben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn also die Produktion ausfällt, weil Du (aufgrund der Monitoring-Daten, des Runbooks und Deiner Erfahrungen) angenommen hast, daß (A) der Fall war und deswegen (H) gemacht hast, aber in Wahrheit lag (B) vor und (H) hat alles gecrasht, &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dann ist es ein Problem, wenn die Monitoring-Daten zu langsam aufbereitet worden sind,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wenn nie alle wichtigen Dinge gemessen worden sind,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wenn das Runbook unvollständig oder unklar ist,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;oder wenn Du unzureichend ausgebildet worden bist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es ist außerdem zu prüfen, ob diese Entscheidung (H) zu machen überhaupt manuell zu treffen ist, und ob dann eine manuelle Handlung initiiert werden muss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kurz: Der Blameless Postmortem konzentriert sich nicht darauf, &lt;em&gt;wer&lt;/em&gt; die Produktion gecrasht hat, sondern welche Kette von Entscheidungen dazu geführt hat, dass die gerade Dienst habende Person die Produktion crashen musste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So eine Diskussion über die Grenzen von Firmen, Verträgen, Statements of Work und mögliche Schadensersatzforderungen durchzuführen ist nahezu unmöglich, oder jedenfalls im Haus sehr viel einfacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wieder braucht es dazu aber auch in der öffentlichen Verwaltung eine andere Kultur:
einen grundlegenden Wandel, ein Bekenntnis zu Offenheit, Transparenz, Kooperation und Open Source.
Solange sich das nicht ändert, wird sich die Tragödie vom Scheitern der Digitalisierung in der deutschen Verwaltung wieder und wieder und wieder wiederholen.&lt;/p&gt;

:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel will Xeon-Funktionen als Lizenz-Update verkaufen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mit dem Software Defined Silicon will Intel in Xeon-Hardware zunächst abgeschaltete Funktionen künftig als Lizenz-Upgrade bereitstellen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/HonkHase/status/1442760700112343044&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Manuel Atug ranted&lt;/a&gt;

 darüber auf Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2021/09/intel-software-silicon.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wenn dir die eigene Hardware nicht mehr gehört&amp;hellip;
Intel will Xeon-Funktionen als Lizenz-Update verkaufen
&amp;ldquo;Mit dem Software Defined Silicon will Intel in Xeon-Hardware zunächst abgeschaltete Funktionen künftig als Lizenz-Upgrade bereitstellen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ich &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/isotopp/status/1442896442926895104&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;antwortete&lt;/a&gt;

:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das braucht wesentlich mehr Kontext.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;xeons-sind-selten-und-haben-nicht-viele-kunden&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#xeons-sind-selten-und-haben-nicht-viele-kunden&#34;&gt;
	Xeons sind selten und haben nicht viele Kunden
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel stellt zurzeit eine sehr kleine einstellige Anzahl Millionen Xeon CPUs her.
Davon gehen 85 % an weniger als 10 Kunden - Hyperscaler in den USA und China.
12 % oder so gehen an ca. 150 Kunden, die messbare Stückzahlen der Produktion aufkaufen.
Der Rest sind Kleinkunden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist eine sehr ungesunde Marktstruktur, und Intel weiß um die Probleme, die das mit sich bringt.
Dies ist keine neue Situation, sondern war schon ein Problem, bevor Apple mit ARM losgelegt hat und AMD mit dem EPYC auf den Markt kam.
Diese beiden Ereignisse haben die Situation aber noch verkompliziert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dazu kommt noch, dass die obigen Prozentangaben nach Stückzahlen sind, nicht nach Core-Count.
Denn ansonsten sähe die Situation noch extremer aus:
Hyperscaler haben Interesse an immer größeren CPUs mit immer mehr Kernen, und immer höherer Dichte in ihren Rechenzentren.
Hyperscaler haben CPU Utilization und Return-per-Core als KPI und wollen Custom Silicon zum Auslagern der Virtualisierung, für das Netz, oder spezielle Tensorflow CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normale Kunden sehen das nicht so:
man kann in einer 64C/128T-Core-Single-Socket-Konfiguration mit 2-4 TB RAM unter Umständen den gesamten Serverbedarf einer kleineren Firma in einer einzelnen physikalischen Maschine in VMs unterbringen.
Das Problem dabei: Explosionsradius, wenn mal etwas ausfällt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;cloud-und-on-premise-driften-auseinander&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#cloud-und-on-premise-driften-auseinander&#34;&gt;
	Cloud und On-Premise driften auseinander
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effektiv bewirkt dies, dass die Bauweise der Rechner, die in der Public Cloud Dienst tun, und die Bauweise der Rechner in den Rechenzentren normaler Leute stehen auseinander driften.
Das fängt heute an, aber der Bruch wird sich in den kommenden 5-10 Jahren noch vertiefen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein Xeon-Markt für Hyperscaler ist groß, aber der Xeon-Markt &amp;ldquo;Server CPU für Cloud-Feinde&amp;rdquo; wird eher klein sein und schrumpfen.
Und wird sich dann irgendwann nicht mehr lohnen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davon mal abgesehen wird durch die laufend verbesserte Integration Chipfläche frei, und Intel muss sehen, was damit anzufangen ist, wenn es nicht &amp;ldquo;immer mehr Cores&amp;rdquo; sein können.
Software Defined Silicon ist ein Testballon, mit dem man das herausfinden kann.
Für die Firma wäre es schon wichtig, das herauszufinden:
von oben drücken die Hyperscaler mit ihren Forderungen nach Mengenrabatten, von der Seite drängt AMD mit ihrer derzeit überlegenen EPYC-Architektur in den Markt und von unten drückt ARM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vielen Kunden können diese Pay-to-Play Features egal sein:
Eine Webshop-Workload sieht in einem Intel vTune aus wie ein REP MOVSB Benchmark, memcpy() at scale, Variablen werden in HTML Templates eingesetzt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sogar die FPU und die ganzen AVX-Instruktionen - das ist alles Verschwendung von Chipfläche für die meisten Kunden.
Nur wenige Anwendungen brauchen und nutzen diese Funktionalität in der CPU wirklich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man stelle sich vor, man muss zum Beispiel für einen Inference Offloader (&amp;ldquo;bestehende Machine Learning Netze ausführen, nicht lernen&amp;rdquo;) bezahlen, und dann wird der auf den meisten Maschinen nie angewendet.
Aber eine Serie CPUs herstellen, die diesen Inference Offloader hat, ihnen eine eigene Seriennummer zu geben und sie einzeln zu verkaufen will auch keiner.
Die Stückzahlen und die Preise geben das nicht her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;der-marktdruck-zeigt-zur-cloud&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#der-marktdruck-zeigt-zur-cloud&#34;&gt;
	Der Marktdruck zeigt zur Cloud
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn aber absehbar ist, dass in 5-10 Jahren die Trennung von Cloud-Hardware und On-Premise Hardware vollzogen sein wird, dann ist es auch klar, dass es nach Ablauf dieser Zeit nicht mehr möglich sein wird, ein Rechenzentrum mit Private Cloud kompetitiv zu betreiben.
Das wird so kommen, weil die Cloud-Technik schlicht proprietär und für normalsterbliche Kunden nicht zu haben sein wird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bei der Technik und der Wirtschaftlichkeit zeigen alle Push- und Pull-Faktoren derzeit massiv in Richtung Cloud.
Wer sein Unternehmen und seine IT darin nicht mit Gewalt und jetzt in die Public Cloud bringt, der wird nach dem Vollzug dieser Trennung in die Röhre schauen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eigene Server vor Ort sind - bei vorhersagbarem Bedarf - auf viele Weisen billiger als in der Cloud zu mieten.
Aber man muss dann auch die eigenen Operations professionalisieren und man muss sich überlegen, wo in 5-10 Jahren die Technik herkommen soll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Und wenn wir uns noch einmal die eingangs diskutierte Kundenstruktur von Intel ansehen, dann gibt es weniger als 200 Unternehmen weltweit, die dazu die erforderliche Masse haben.
Das ist sehr frustrierend.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/LilithWittmann/status/1435135620658122752&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Lilith Wittmann&lt;/a&gt;

 asked on Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do we have so much dangerous software in Germany?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we don&amp;rsquo;t have the competency anywhere (administration, enterprise or science) to understand the complexity of software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/isotopp/status/1435141131285762052&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;My take was&lt;/a&gt;

:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer science is easy.
It is the science of Zeroes and Ones, and it does not get any more complicated anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer science piles abstractions on top of each other, though, 30 layers deep and with non-linear interactions.
That creates a different kind of complexity that is also harder to handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you grow older, you learn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer science is the science of boxes and arrows between them.
Zeroes and Ones hardly matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boxes are still trivial, but problems come from the dependencies.
If the dependencies symbolize &amp;ldquo;communication between systems&amp;rdquo; things get truly awful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communication and consensus are lossy and hard to do, and until recently, were untestable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you grow even older, you learn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer science is the science of crystallized processes.
Code is law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Processes are contracts between people that regulate who talks when to whom about what and why.
Programs for human distributed systems, &amp;ldquo;companies&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer science takes processes and create a machine-readable form of them.
Interactions between people are mediated through code and automated.
That can be good, but requires that you understand the process and why it is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/06/15/pizza-people-projects-and-processes.html&#34;&gt;Pizza, People, Projects and Processes&lt;/a&gt;

 has some fundamental things about processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The german government fails at digitization&amp;rdquo; means from this point of view that the system has lost the ability to understand its own processes and to change them in a controlled way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is ossified and critical organisational knowledge is not available.&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 11:15:50 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/08/18/epochalypse.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had reason to look into the UNIX Eschaton, the time when the signed 32 bit counter of seconds since Midnight, 1970-01-01 UTC overflows. Going &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time#Notable_events_in_Unix_time&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;to Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;

, I learned we will die two years earlier, because in 2036-02-07, 06:28:16 UTC NTP will kill us all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 06:28:16 UTC on Thursday, 7 February 2036, Network Time Protocol will loop over to the next epoch, as the 32-bit time stamp value used in NTP (unsigned, but based on 1 January 1900) will overflow. This date is close to the following date because the 136-year range of a 32-bit integer number of seconds is close to twice the 70-year offset between the two epochs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I wanted to know the state of things. &lt;a href=&#34;https://linuxreviews.org/Year_2038_Timestamp_Problem&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Linuxreviews&lt;/a&gt;

 tells me that the kernel already uses a 64 bit time_t internally, so we are good for the next few billion years. Unfortunately, a lot of other structures don&amp;rsquo;t, and some of them are persisted on disk.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extending a persistent data structure is hard, and often cannot be done in-place. In many filesystems, the inode is a tight fit and extending timestamp will double the size of an inode, going up from one power of two to the next higher power of two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ext4 filesystem &lt;a href=&#34;https://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Ext4_Disk_Layout#Inode_Table&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;inode structure&lt;/a&gt;

 stores &lt;a href=&#34;https://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Ext4_Disk_Layout#Inode_Timestamps&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;64 bit timestamps&lt;/a&gt;

 these days, but the conversion cannot be done in-place. Since Linux 5.4 you get a warning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ext4 filesystem being mounted at (mountpoint) supports timestamps until 2038&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need to dump these file systems, recreate them with 64 bit support and then restore the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XFS has the &lt;code&gt;bigtime&lt;/code&gt; option since 5.10. It counts signed 64 bit, but at nanosecond resolution, so it is good until the year 2468.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NFS V4 has 64 bit timestamps with a second resolution, since 20 years. Anybody using NFS V2 or V3 already gets exactly what they deserve, so not a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java counts 64 bit signed values, but uses milliseconds. Good for another 300 million years. Other systems do 64 bit signed, but count microseconds. Still sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am expecting the first &amp;ldquo;Enterprise 2038 Compliance&amp;rdquo; projects to start very soon. It will be great fun to find every single timestamp in a large enterprise and check it for 64 bit time_t. The fact that afterwards there will be different cutoff dates due to different timer resolutions will be even more fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;negative-leap-seconds&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#negative-leap-seconds&#34;&gt;
	Negative Leap Seconds
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What also can kill us: Theoretically there are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.timeanddate.com/time/negative-leap-second.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;negative leap seconds&lt;/a&gt;

, but no code in the world is prepared for them actually happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;gps&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#gps&#34;&gt;
	GPS
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPS will have interesting events in October this year, that is, in 2 months time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/gpsd/gpsd/-/issues/144&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GPSD time will jump back 1024 weeks at after week=2180 (23-October-2021)
&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-and-worse&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#why-and-worse&#34;&gt;
	Why?, and worse
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was triggered by &lt;a href=&#34;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-peabody-dispatch-new-uuid-format&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;draft-peabody-dispatch-new-uuid-format-01&lt;/a&gt;

 speaking about &amp;ldquo;36-bit big-endian unsigned Unix Timestamp values&amp;rdquo; in various places. The text also contains phrases such as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example a 36-bit timestamp source would fully utilize timestamp_32 and 4-bits of timestamp_48. The remaining 12-bits in timestamp_48 MUST be set to 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The string 2038 appears nowhere in this document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a draft, it contains obvious typos in several place, but generally speaking UUID v7 and UUID v8 look underspecified, with different implementation variants, and have the look of untested ideas. I agree &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/09/22/alter-table-for-uuid.html&#34;&gt;on the general idea&lt;/a&gt;

 of sort-ordering UUID values PK friendly, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/04/06/mysql-and-uuids.html&#34;&gt;having a proper UUIDv1&lt;/a&gt;

 looks like the safer option to me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Dec 2020 18:25:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/12/28/fork-exec-wait-and-exit.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2007/01/07/fork-exec-wait-und-exit.html&#34;&gt;english version of a 2007 article&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;news:de.comp.os.unix.linux.misc&#34;&gt;de.comp.os.unix.linux.misc&lt;/a&gt;

 somebody asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are commands in a script executed strictly sequentially, that is,
will the next command only be executed when the previous command has
completed, or will the shell &lt;strong&gt;automatically&lt;/strong&gt; start the next command
if the system has spare capacity?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can I change the default behavior - whatever it may be - in any way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are looking into the fine manual, it may explain at some point that the shell starts each command in a separate process. Then you may continue your thought process and ask what that actually means. As soon as you get to this stage, you may want to have a look at the Unix process lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;processes-and-programs&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#processes-and-programs&#34;&gt;
	Processes and programs
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A program in Unix is a sequence of executable instructions on a disk. You can use the command &lt;em&gt;size&lt;/em&gt; to get a very cursory check of the structure and memory demands of the program, or use the various invocations of &lt;em&gt;objdump&lt;/em&gt; for a much more detailed view. The only aspect that is of interest to us is the fact that a program is a sequence of instructions and data (on disk) that may potentially be executed at some point in time, maybe even multiple times, maybe even concurrently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a program in execution is called a process. The process contains the code and initial data of the program itself, and the actual state at the current point in time for the current execution. That is the memory map and the associated memory (check /proc/&lt;em&gt;pid&lt;/em&gt;/maps), but also the program counter, the processor registers, the stack, and finally the current root directory, the current directory, environment variables and the open files, plus a few other things (in modern Linux for example, we find the processes cgroups and namespace relationships, and so on - things became a lot more complicated since 1979).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Unix processes and programs are two different and independent things. You can run a program more than once, concurrently. For example, you can run two instances of the &lt;em&gt;vi&lt;/em&gt; editor, which edit two different texts. Program and initial data are the same: it is the same editor. But the state inside the processes is different: the text, the insert mode, cursor position and so on differ. From a programmers point of view, &amp;ldquo;the code is the same, but the variable values are differing&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A process can run more than one program: The currently running program is throwing itself away, but asks that the operating system loads a different program into the same process. The new program will inherit some reused process state, such as current directories, file handles, privileges and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of that is done in original Unix, at the system level, with only four syscalls:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;exec()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;usermode-and-kernel&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#usermode-and-kernel&#34;&gt;
	Usermode and Kernel
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/prozesswechsel.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Context switching: Process 1 is running for a bit, but at (1) the kernel interrupts the execution and switches to process 2. Some time later, process 2 is frozen, and we context switch back to where we left off with (1), and so on. For each process, this seems to be seamless, but it happens in intervals that are not continous.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever a Unix process does a system call (and at some other opportunities) the current process leaves the user context and the operating system code is being activated. This is privileged kernel code, and the activation is not quite a subroutine call, because not only is privileged mode activated, but also a kernel stack is being used and the CPU registers of the user process are saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the point of view of the kernel function, the user process that has called us is inert data and can be manipulated at will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kernel will then execute the system call on behalf of the user program, and then will try to exit the kernel. The typical way to leave the kernel is through the scheduler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scheduler will review the process list and current situation. It will then decide into which of all the different userland processes to exit. It will restore the chosen processes registers, then return into this processes context, using this processes stack. The chosen process may or may not be the one that made the system call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short: Whenever you make a system call, you may (or may not) lose the CPU to another process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s not too bad, because this other process at some point has to give up the CPU and the kernel will then return into our process as if nothing happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our program is not being executed linearly, but in a sequence of subjectively linear segments, with breaks inbetween. During these breaks the CPU is working on segments of other processes that are also runnable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fork-and-exit&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#fork-and-exit&#34;&gt;
	fork() and exit()
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In traditional Unix the only way to create a process is using the &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; system call. The new process gets a copy of the current program, but new process id (pid). The process id of the parent process (the process that called &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt;) is registered as the new processes parent pid (ppid) to build a process tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the parent process, &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; returns and delivers the new processes pid as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new process also returns from the &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; system call (because that is when the copy was made), but the result of the &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; is 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; is a special system call. You call it once, but the function returns twice: Once in the parent, and once in the child process. &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; increases the number of processes in the system by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every Unix process always starts their existence by returning from a &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; system call with a 0 result, running the same program as the parent process. They can have different fates because the result of the &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; system call is different in the parent and child incarnation, and that can drive execution down different &lt;code&gt;if()&lt;/code&gt; branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34; data-lang=&#34;c&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;cpf&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;cpf&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;unistd.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;cpf&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;stdlib.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;pid_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;pid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;pid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;fork&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;pid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;I am the child.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;I am the parent, the child is %d.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;pid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;pid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;perror&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;In fork():&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running this, we get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;kris@linux:/tmp/kris&amp;gt; make probe1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;cc     probe1.c   -o probe1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;kris@linux:/tmp/kris&amp;gt; ./probe1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;I am the child.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;I am the parent, the child is 16959.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are defining a variable &lt;code&gt;pid&lt;/code&gt; of the type &lt;code&gt;pid_t&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This variable saves the &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; result, and using it we activate one (&amp;ldquo;I am the child.&amp;rdquo;) or the other (&amp;ldquo;I am the parent&amp;rdquo;) branch of an if().&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running the program we get two result lines. Since we have only one variable, and this variable can have only one state, an instance of the program can only be in either one or the other branch of the code. Since we see two lines of output, two instances of the program with different values for &lt;code&gt;pid&lt;/code&gt; must have been running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we called &lt;code&gt;getpid()&lt;/code&gt; and printed the result we could prove this by showing two different pids (change the program to do this as an exercise!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; system call is entered once, but left twice, and increments the number of processes in the system by one. After finishing our program the number of processes in the system is as large as before. That means there must be another system call which decrements the number of system calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This system call is &lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt; is a system call you enter once and never leave. It decrements the number of processes in the system by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt; also accepts an exit status as a parameter, which the parent process can receive (or even has to receive), and which communicates the fate of the child to the parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our example, all variants of the program call &lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt; - we are calling &lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt; in the child process, but also in the parent process. That means we terminate two processes. We can only do this, because even the parent process is a child, and in fact, a child of our shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shell does exactly the same thing we are doing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;bash (16957) --- calls fork() ---&amp;gt; bash (16958) --- becomes ---&amp;gt; probe1 (16958)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;probe1 (16958) --- calls fork() ---&amp;gt; probe1 (16959) --&amp;gt; exit()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;   |
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;   +---&amp;gt; exit()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt; closes all files and sockets, frees all memory and then terminates the process. The parameter of &lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt; is the only thing that survives and is handed over to the parent process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wait&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#wait&#34;&gt;
	wait()
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our child process ends with an &lt;code&gt;exit(0)&lt;/code&gt;. The 0 is the exit status of our program and can be shipped. We need to make the parent process pick up this value and we need a new system call for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This system call is &lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34; data-lang=&#34;c&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;cpf&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;cpf&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;unistd.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;cpf&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;stdlib.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;cpf&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;sys/types.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;cpf&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;sys/wait.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the runtime protocol:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;kris@linux:/tmp/kris&amp;gt; make probe2

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;I am the child.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;I am the parent, the child is 17399.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;I am the child, 10 seconds later.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;End of process 17399: The process ended with exit(0).
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The variable &lt;code&gt;status&lt;/code&gt; is passed to the system call &lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt; as a reference parameter, and will be overwritten by it. The value is a bitfield, containing the exit status and additional reasons explaining how the program ended. To decode this, C offers a number of macros with predicates such as &lt;code&gt;WIFEXITED()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;WIFSIGNALED()&lt;/code&gt;. We also get extractors, such as &lt;code&gt;WEXITSTATUS()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;WTERMSIG()&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt; also returns the pid of the process that terminated, as a function result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt; stops execution of the parent process until either a signal arrives or a child process terminates. You can arrange for a SIGALARM to be sent to you in order to time bound the &lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-init-program-and-zombies&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-init-program-and-zombies&#34;&gt;
	The &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; program, and Zombies
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; with the pid 1 will do basically nothing but calling &lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt;: It waits for terminating processes and polls their exit status, only to throw it away. It also reads &lt;code&gt;/etc/inittab&lt;/code&gt; and starts the programs configured there. When something from &lt;code&gt;inittab&lt;/code&gt; terminates and is set to &lt;code&gt;respawn&lt;/code&gt;, it will be restarted by &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a child process terminates while the parent process is not (yet) waiting for the exit status, &lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt; will still free all memory, file handles and so on, but the &lt;code&gt;struct task&lt;/code&gt; (basically the &lt;code&gt;ps&lt;/code&gt; entry) cannot be thrown away. It may be that the parent process at some point in time arrives at a &lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt; and then we have to have the exit status, which is stored in a field in the &lt;code&gt;struct task&lt;/code&gt;, so we need to retain it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while the child process is dead already, the process list entry cannot die because the exit status has not yet been polled by the parent. Unix calls such processes without memory or other resouces associated &lt;em&gt;Zombies&lt;/em&gt;. Zombies are visible in the process list when a process generator (a forking process) is faulty and does not &lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt; properly. They do not take up memory or any other resouces but the bytes that make up their &lt;code&gt;struct task&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other case can happen, too: The parent process exits while the child moves on. The kernel will set the ppid of such children with dead parents to the constant value 1, or in other words: &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; inherits orphaned processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the child terminates, &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; will &lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt; for the exit status of the child, because that&amp;rsquo;s what &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; does. No Zombies in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we observe the number of processes in the system to be largely constant over time, then the number of calls to &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt; have to balanced. This is, because for each &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; there will be an &lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt; to match and for each &lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt; there must be a &lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt; somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, and in modern systems, the situation is a bit more complicated, but the original idea is as simple as this. We have a clean fork-exit-wait triangle that describes all processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;exec&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#exec&#34;&gt;
	exec()
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; makes processes, &lt;code&gt;exec()&lt;/code&gt; loads programs into processes that already exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34; data-lang=&#34;c&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;cpf&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here the code of &lt;code&gt;probe3&lt;/code&gt; is thrown away in the child process (the &lt;code&gt;perror(&amp;quot;In exec():&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt; is not reached). Instead the running program is being replaced by the given call to &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the protocol we can see the parent instance of &lt;code&gt;probe3&lt;/code&gt; waits for the &lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt;. Since the &lt;code&gt;perror()&lt;/code&gt; after the &lt;code&gt;execl()&lt;/code&gt;is never executed, it cannot be an &lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt; in our code. In fact, &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; ends the process we made with an &lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt; and that is what we receive our exit status from in our parent processes &lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt; call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-same-as-a-shellscript&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-same-as-a-shellscript&#34;&gt;
	The same, as a Shellscript
    &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux uses a generalization of the original Unix &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt;, named &lt;code&gt;clone()&lt;/code&gt;, to create child processes. That is why we do not see &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; in a Linux system to create a child process, but a &lt;code&gt;clone()&lt;/code&gt; call with some parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux also uses a specialized variant of &lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt;, called &lt;code&gt;waitpid()&lt;/code&gt;, to wait for a specific pid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux finally uses the &lt;code&gt;exec()&lt;/code&gt; variant &lt;code&gt;execve()&lt;/code&gt; to load programs, but that is just shuffling the paramters around. At the end of &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; (PID 30048) the process 30025 will wake up from the &lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt; and continue.&lt;/p&gt;

 is the original C-code of the original &lt;code&gt;sh&lt;/code&gt; from 1979, with the &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; system call. Search for &lt;code&gt;case TFORK:&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, check out the programming style of Mr. Bourne - this is C, even if it does not look like it.&lt;/p&gt;

, which has not been translated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When implementing &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; in Windows as part of the WSL 1, Microsoft ran into a lot of problems with the syscall, and wrote an article about how they hate it, and why they think their &lt;code&gt;CreateProcessEx()&lt;/code&gt; (in Unix: &lt;code&gt;spawn()&lt;/code&gt;) would be better.

 makes a number of good points, but is still wrong. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rechenzentren und ihren Stromverbrauch regulieren</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/11/01/rechenzentren-und-ihren-stromverbrauch-regulieren.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Nov 2020 13:04:46 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/11/01/rechenzentren-und-ihren-stromverbrauch-regulieren.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Es gibt ein Interview mit Stefan Ramesohl vom Umweltministerium (des Bundes) in Netzpolitik.org: &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://netzpolitik.org/2020/interview-zur-umweltpolitischen-digitalagenda-warum-niemand-weiss-wie-viele-rechenzentren-es-in-europa-gibt/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Warum niemand weiß, wie viele Rechenzentren es in Europa gibt&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;rdquo;. Im Wesentlichen hat das Umweltministerium angesagt, daß es auf europäischer Ebene Rechenzentren erfassen und katalogisieren will, um in einem zweiten Schritt den Energieverbrauch von Rechenzentren zu regulieren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist sehr spannend, denn derzeit gibt es keine Übersicht über Rechenzentren in Europa, und tatsächlich sind einige Rechenzentrumsbetreiber sehr paranoid, was den genauen Standort ihrer Hardware angeht und wieviel und welche Hardware darin ist oder was diese tut. Das ist zwar lächerlich - es ist sehr schwierig eine Energiesenke wie ein Rechenzentrum und ihre Abwärme zu verstecken - aber auch ein sehr sensitives Thema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In dem Interview gibt es ein paar Dinge, die Anmerkungen verdienen, aber bevor es los geht noch die anderen Artikel in diesem Blog als Links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/07/19/threads-vs-watts.html&#34;&gt;Threads vs. Watts&lt;/a&gt;

: Ich habe einen Dell R630 mit zwei Xeon 6132 CPUs getestet, und deren Energieverbrauch unter Last gemessen. Die Resultate sind repräsentativ für die ganze Klasse von Rechnern, die eine Art Arbeitspferd im modernen Rechenzentrum sind. Der Hauptpunkt: 50% der maximalen Energieaufnahme werden bereits bei 20% Auslastung aufgenommen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2018/02/21/a-journey-to-open-compute.html&#34;&gt;A Journey to Open Compute&lt;/a&gt;

: Mit Open Compute hat Facebook die Energieaufnahme eines Rechners in Idle auf 50% eines herkömmlichen Rechners senken können, und unter Volllast auf 80%. Das wird ermöglicht, indem man Rechner, Rack und Raum nach einer gemeinsamen Spezifikation baut und optimiert. Der Open Compute Standard ist jetzt eine offene Spezifikation, aber wegen der Abhängigkeiten zwischen Raum, Rack und Rechner lohnt sich das alles nur, wenn man ein &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech#GAFAM_or_FAAMG&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GAFAM&lt;/a&gt;

-type Hyperscaler ist.&lt;/li&gt;

 listet generell die Zusammenhänge zwischen Rechnen, Batterieverbrauch und Abwärme auf.&lt;/li&gt;

: Wenn man Netflix schaut, wird Energie verbraucht. Wo und wieviel? Wir reden über Endgeräte (die nur wenige Watt brauchen), über Open Compute in Rechenzentren und über Energieverbrauch im Netzwerk, speziell auf der letzten Meile. Letzterer variiert enorm: 5G braucht sehr viel Energie, (V)DSL ist ebenfalls sehr aufwendig, und Glasfaser nicht - sie ist leicht eine Zehnerpotenz günstiger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2019/12/28/streaming-and-energy.html&#34;&gt;Streaming and Energy&lt;/a&gt;

 und &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/03/19/netflix-does-not-bring-down-the-internet.html&#34;&gt;Netflix does not bring down the Internet&lt;/a&gt;

: Speziell Videostreaming funktioniert schon sehr optimiert: Videos werden in Edge Data Centers gespeichert und nicht neu codiert, sie werden in der niedrigsten sinnvollen Auflösung geliefert und die Decodierung erfolgt mit spezieller Hardware, damit die Batterie im Endgerät länger hält. All das braucht weniger Energie als angenommen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/06/08/cloud-and-energy.html&#34;&gt;Cloud and Energy&lt;/a&gt;

: Das Uptime Institut sagt: &amp;ldquo;Data center energy efficiency gains have flattened out&amp;rdquo; (und sieht einen durchschnittlichen PUE von 1.58). Uptime sagt im selben Text aber auch, daß neuere und größere Facilities mit Open Compute &lt;em&gt;signifikant&lt;/em&gt; bessere PUE haben. Der einfachste Weg zur Verbesserung von PUE für die meisten Firmen ist, ihre Workloads in die Cloud zu verlagern (und dynamisch zu skalieren). Das hat bei korrekter Durchführung neben Energieffizienz auch noch jede Menge andere Vorteile, die sich aus einem gelungenen Outsourcing ergeben.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	Hyperscaler-Rechenzentren sind viel energieeffizienter
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auf Twitter ging ich auf &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/isotopp/status/1322857383929012224&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;das Interview ein&lt;/a&gt;

:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Netzpolitik.org:&lt;/em&gt; Diese großen Player können ja kein Interesse an staatlicher Regulierung haben, sondern werden versuchen, eine branchenweite Selbstverpflichtung herbeizuführen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eher nicht. Als &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech#GAFAM_or_FAAMG&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GAFAM&lt;/a&gt;

 wäre man sinnvollerweise für mehr Regulierung, denn das käme effektiv einem Cloud-Zwang gleich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wie oben bereits dargestellt, hat GAFAM bereits Rechenzentren, die sehr viel effizienter mit der Energie umgehen als normale Rechenzentren es tun. Das ist so, weil diese Rechenzentren Raum, Rack und Rechner als ein System designed haben und weil die Betreiber als Hyperscaler es sich leisten können, solche Rechenzentren nach Maß zu designen, bauen zu lassen und zu optimieren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Während also ein traditionelles Rechenzentrum Rechner für eine Million Watt betreibt und dafür um die 600.000W an Kühlung und anderer Sekundärenergie aufbringen muß (Power Utilization Efficiency, PUE 1.6), können die am Besten optimierten Google-Rechenzentren eine Million Watt an Rechnern mit 60.000W Sekundärenergie betreiben (PUE 1.06).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein effektiver PUE von &amp;lt;1.2 ist par für die Hyperscaler-Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein kleinerer Rechenzentrums-Nutzer füllt nicht ein ganzes RZ mit Rechnern, läßt also nicht nach Maß bauen, sondern mietet existierenden RZ-Space, der prinzipbedingt nicht gut geeignet ist für Open Compute (OCP). Existierende RZ-Space ist generisch, er muß jede Art von IT-Equiment aufnehmen können und ist daher oft Überkühlt, der Airflow ist nicht optimiert und hat auf diese Weise mindestens dreimal mehr Overhead als RZ-Space, den Hyperscaler nach Maß bauen (PUE &amp;lt;1.2 vs. PUE ~ 1.6). Noch kleinere Benutzer füllen nur einzelne Räume oder haben Raumabschnitte (&amp;ldquo;Cages&amp;rdquo;), teilen also die Kühlung mit anderen Nutzern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperscaler bauen nicht nur ein RZ, sondern tun das in Serie, und iterieren dabei das Design. Sie lassen auch Rechner und Rechnerkonzepte wie OCP entwickeln, und stimmen dabei das Design des RZ auf das Design von Rack und Rechner ab - daher kommt die energetische Überlegenheit von OCP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dazu kommt, wie oben auch dargestellt, daß ein ausgelasteter Rechner energieeffizienter ist als einer, der teilweise vor sich hin idled. Ein Dell R630 verbraucht bereits 50% seiner maximalen Energie bei 20% Auslastung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maschinen auszulasten und Workloads dynamisch zu skalieren ist etwas, für das &amp;ldquo;die Cloud&amp;rdquo;, also die API-gesteuerten Rechenzentren der Hyperscaler, gebaut worden sind. Hyperscale Clouds haben &amp;ldquo;sellable cores per provisioned cores&amp;rdquo; als eine zentrale Optimierungsmetrik, sie wollen ausgelastete Rechner, weil das die Einnahmen definiert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2017/07/watt-thread.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watts per Thread (Dell R630, Dual Xeon 6132)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wie dem auch sei: Aus energetischer Sicht ist Auslastung wichtig, weil die Watts zur Aktivierung des n-ten Rechenkerns asymptotisch günstiger sind. Das ist so, weil die Idle-Energieaufnahme der Maschine und des ganzen Rechenzentrums drumherum sich so amortisiert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Außerdem: Wenn man es sich leisten kann, Hyperthreading zu aktivieren (Wegen der diversen Intel-Caching-Bugs der letzten Jahre ist das oft ein Sicherheitsrisiko), dann sind die Hyperthreads energetisch betrachtet nahezu kostenfrei. Integer- und Stringprocessing-Workloads können Hypterthreads als nahezu vollwertige zweite CPU betrachten, Fließkomma-intensive Workloads nicht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webshops sind, wenn sie richtig gebaut worden sind, String- und Integer-Anwendungen und sehr wenig Fließkomma-intensiv, könnten also von Hyperthreading voll profitieren. Die Anzahl der nutzbaren Cores verdoppelt sich rechnerisch und ist bei Webshop fast vollständig realisierbar - ein Webshop mit einer fast reinen Integer/String Workload kann von den 56 rechnerischen Kernen einer Dual-6132 eine Load von deutlich über 40 stabil verarbeiten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;kosten-und-energie&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#kosten-und-energie&#34;&gt;
	Kosten und Energie
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Über eine Nutzungsdauer von fünf Jahren gerechnet machen Energiekosten in etwa die Hälfte der Gesamtkosten eines Rechners aus - für einen Hyperscaler ist das ein so intensiver Kostenfaktor, daß sie aus wirtschaftlichen Gründen seit mehr als 15 Jahren intensiv die Energieaufnahme ihrer Rechenzentren in allen Punkten optimieren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist der primäre Grund für das Open Compute Projekt (OCP) und die Bauweise der Hyperscaler-Rechenzentren. Für Hyperscaler lohnt dies, weil das der Kernbereich ihres wirtschaftlichen Handelns ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dazu kommt, wie in der Leseliste dargestellt, daß alle Hyperscaler (bis auf Amazon) bereits 100% graugrün sind, also zu großen Teilen bereits auf tatsächlich regenerativer Energie laufen und den Rest mit Zertifikaten kompensieren, und obendrein sehr nah in der Zukunft liegende Ziele haben, was komplett grünen Betrieb &lt;em&gt;und&lt;/em&gt; Überkompensation angeht. Speziell Google ist ein sehr großer Investor in Wind- und Solarkraftanlagen, Netflix überkompensiert bereits jetzt, ist also Carbon-Negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Für ein Firma, für die der Betrieb und die Skalierung von Rechenzentren und ihrer Hardware nicht der Kern ihres wirtschaftlichen Handelns ist, ist es ausgeschlossen hier mitzuhalten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oder wie Ramesohl es formuliert:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es ist einfach so, dass eine gewisse Skalierung zu großen Vorteilen führt, die dann wiederum über eine Wettbewerbsfähigkeit im Markt die Marktposition stärkt und damit den Marktanteil erhöht. Das ist ein selbstverstärkender Effekt. Hinzu kommt, dass diese Akteure in der Lage waren, zu investieren und sich damit ein technologisches Know-how aufzubauen, was wiederum im Umkehrschluss ihre Marktposition stärkt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist richtig, dass gerade bei den großen Playern entsprechende selbstdefinierte Nachhaltigkeitsziele vorliegen. Das sind teilweise sehr ambitionierte Pläne, die versuchen, die Emissionen, die im Laufe der Unternehmensgeschichte bisher aufgelaufen sind, rückwirkend zu kompensieren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bandbreite-und-energie&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#bandbreite-und-energie&#34;&gt;
	Bandbreite und Energie
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ramesohl sagt auch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Da geht es um die Frage, ob jede Internetwerbung eine Autoplay-Funktion braucht, also abspielt, wenn ich nur über die Seite scrolle. Das erzeugt nämlich ein enormes Datenvolumen. Oder die Frage, ob alles standardmäßig in höchster Auflösung gestreamt werden muss, wenn es auf einem kleinen Bildschirm angeschaut wird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dahinter steht die Fehlmeinung, daß eine Netzwerkinfrastruktur mehr Energie benötigt, wenn Daten übertragen werden. Das ist nicht der Fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So wie eine Festplatte oder RAM nicht schwerer werden oder mehr Energie verbrauchen, wenn Daten darin gespeichert werden, so braucht ein kabelgebundenener Netzwerklink nicht (wesentlich) mehr Energie, wenn Daten übertragen werden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RAM und Festplatten brauchen (mehr) Energie, wenn Daten &lt;em&gt;geändert&lt;/em&gt; werden, also Bits gekippt werden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Und kabelgebundenene Netzwerkinfrastruktur überträgt immer Daten (Trägersignale), auf die die Nutzlast dann aufmoduliert wird. Das wiederum braucht im Vergleich zur Grundlast des Netzes (das Senden des Trägers) kaum Energie. Anders sieht es bei Funkverbindungen, also Datenübertragung via Mobilfunknetz aus, dort wird der Sender komplett abgeschaltet, wenn er nicht gebraucht wird, um das Spektrum frei zu halten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speziell bei Glasfaser ist es so, daß man die Bandbreite zudem mit nur wenig mehr Energieaufwand um Größenordnungen hochdrehen kann, wenn man will - durch den Austausch der Laser kann dasselbe Medium in der Kapazität verzehnfacht oder verhundertfacht werden ohne signifikat mehr Energie zu verbrauchen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;was-tun-wir-mit-all-dem-compute&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#was-tun-wir-mit-all-dem-compute&#34;&gt;
	Was tun wir mit all dem Compute
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am Ende ist es eventuell eine gute Idee, nicht nur genauer hin zu schauen, wo Rechenzentren stehen und wie sie designed sind, sondern was mit den Megawatts gemacht wird, die dort verwendet werden. Auf diese Weise bekommen wir eventuell Bitcoin weg gebombt. Das wäre schon einmal sehr wichtig, denn hier wird Energie in der Größenordnung ganzer Staaten in sinnlosen Berechnungen (&amp;ldquo;Proof of Work&amp;rdquo;) verheizt. Und nein, das kann man nicht ändern, PoW kann nicht sinnvolles berechnen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>When a file changes, do a thing</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2019/11/19/when-a-file-changes-do-a-thing.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2019 12:49:53 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2019/11/19/when-a-file-changes-do-a-thing.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When developing there is often an edit-compile-test cycle, or an
edit-distribute-changes cycle or a similar repetetive task. You
could poll changes, for example with cron every minute or
similarly, but that is wasteful and slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All modern operating systems have mechanisms for processes to
subscribe to file or directory changes. In MacOS, we do have the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/FSEvents_ProgGuide/TechnologyOverview/TechnologyOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40005289-CH3-SW1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;File System Events&lt;/a&gt;


API since 10.5, in Linux we got three different implementations
(as described in &lt;a href=&#34;https://lwn.net/Articles/604686/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;LWN&lt;/a&gt;

): The
original dnotify, its replacement inotify and the even more
recent fanotify (which got its own &lt;a href=&#34;https://lwn.net/Articles/605128/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;LWN
article&lt;/a&gt;

). BSD has kqueue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is that you subscribe to a directory and get notified
for change/create/delete/rename events inside that directory
and/or all events recursively beneath that starting point (a
&amp;lsquo;root&amp;rsquo;). You would be interested into the type of change and the
name of the file path that changes, and you would probably want
to be able to retrieve lists of these changes in batch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make that useful, you would need a shell interface to this,
and there are quite a few by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most convenient seems to be
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/clibs/entr&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;entr&lt;/a&gt;

, because it works most
closely with shell programs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is also &lt;a href=&#34;https://facebook.github.io/watchman/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;watchman&lt;/a&gt;

,
but this requires submitting jobs and processing results in
Javascript to fully use its potential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the first programs to use filesystem subscriptions is
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch/wiki/How-to-Use-fswatch&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;fswatch&lt;/a&gt;

,
but while highly portable, it is cumbersome to use. Instead of
running commands, it just reports filenames to feed into a
pipe to handle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ruby seems to have a library called
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guard/guard&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Guard&lt;/a&gt;

 that also comes with
an interface to shell, but can also being used as a ruby gem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://hackage.haskell.org/package/spy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;spy&lt;/a&gt;

 is a weird piece
of Haskell that produces a small binary that can run commands
on file system changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python seems to come with a bunch of modules and interfaces in
various states of disrepair,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rvoicilas/inotify-tools&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;inotify-tools&lt;/a&gt;

, the
very tiny wrapper &lt;a href=&#34;https://pypi.org/project/inotify_simple/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;inotify_simple&lt;/a&gt;


(the simple here refers to the fact that it is a tiny
wrapper around the C library, not simple to use), the more
convenient &lt;a href=&#34;https://pypi.org/project/inotify/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;inotify&lt;/a&gt;

 and the
high level wrapper
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pythonhosted.org/watchdog/quickstart.html#a-simple-example&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;watchdog&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-test-scenario&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#a-test-scenario&#34;&gt;
	A test scenario
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a test scenario I have a &lt;code&gt;ship-to-kvm&lt;/code&gt; command that I want to
run on every file change. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;rsync -e ssh -t -v --delete --delete-excluded --exclude=&amp;#39;.git&amp;#39; -r \
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;  ~/git_tree/myproject \
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;  devuser@devbox.example.com:myproject
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;when I save my local file from my local editor so that the tree
myproject is made available on my devbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;entr&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#entr&#34;&gt;
	entr
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/clibs/entr&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;entr&lt;/a&gt;

, that is rather
simple. The package &lt;code&gt;entr&lt;/code&gt; is available in Homebrew on MacOS
(&lt;code&gt;brew install entr&lt;/code&gt;) or as a package in Linux (&lt;code&gt;yum install -y entr&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;apt install entr&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You ask entr to watch a list of files or a directory, and when
things change to run a command. You can hit space to force
execution even when nothing changed, or &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; to end the command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various ways to handle changes are provided:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; ls *.js &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; entr -r node myproject.js
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;-r&lt;/code&gt; option here will SIGTERM the node instance, wait for it
to complete and then restart it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get notification of new and deleted files, you need to watch
directories, which are inferred from a file list. This is done
with the &lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; option and in fact the command terminates so you
need to wrap it in a loop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; :&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;   ls &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; entr -d ship-to-kvm
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few other options, but these two should cover the
most common use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;watchman&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#watchman&#34;&gt;
	watchman
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://facebook.github.io/watchman/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;watchman&lt;/a&gt;

 is the facebook
take on things. It consists of a daemon that is automatically
started when you are using the frontend command, and a frontend
command that actually does not expose all the functionality
unless you feed it JSON job files. All command results are also
JSON.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;watchman has the concept of roots, filesystem subtrees that are
being watched, and then triggers that are attached to roots or
subtrees of roots, and are being run on change. A simple
predicate language and a selection of regex libraries can be
used to formulate conditions for triggers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; watchman watch ~/git_tree/myproject &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# this will start the daemon&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; watchman -j ship-to-kvm.json        &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# this defines the job&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;and the actual job definition is then something like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;trigger&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;~/git_tree/myproject&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;name&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;ship-to-kvm&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;expression&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;pcre&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;^[a-zA-Z0-9]&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;command&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;ship-to-kvm&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may look nicer to developers, but I seem to prefer the entr
way of doing things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;python-watchdog&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#python-watchdog&#34;&gt;
	Python watchdog
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Python library
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pythonhosted.org/watchdog/quickstart.html#a-simple-example&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;watchdog&lt;/a&gt;


provides a convenient programmatic interface to inotify and friends
by defining an Observer class and scheduling operations to the
observer when there are events outstanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The example from the manual looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ch&#34;&gt;#! /usr/bin/env python&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;logging&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;watchdog.observers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Observer&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;watchdog.events&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;LoggingEventHandler&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;observer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;and when run does things like this for a &lt;code&gt;touch keks; sleep 1; rm keks&lt;/code&gt; in a secondary shell:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;2019-11-19 14:36:40 - Modified directory: ./.git

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actual observer selection allows a rich palette of event
classes and filters, so dispatching and filtering events is easy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Everything was a file, but we got better</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2019/11/14/everything-was-a-file-but-we-got-better.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2019 11:42:07 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2019/11/14/everything-was-a-file-but-we-got-better.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I fell into the Twitters again. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/carrickdb/status/1194842452361789441&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;@CarrickDB&lt;/a&gt;

 joked about Unix,
Files and Directories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/carrickdb/status/1194842452361789441&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/everything-is-a-file.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is a case of &amp;ldquo;Haha, only serious&amp;rdquo;. Because directories
used to be files, and that was a bad time. Check out the V7 Unix
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/v7unix/v7unix/blob/master/v7/usr/src/cmd/mkdir.c#L49&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;mkdir&lt;/a&gt;


command. At this point in history we do not have a &lt;code&gt;mkdir(2)&lt;/code&gt;
syscall, yet, so we need to construct the entire directory in
multiple steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/v7unix/v7unix/blob/master/v7/usr/src/cmd/mkdir.c#L49&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mknod(2)&lt;/code&gt; an inode that has the &lt;code&gt;S_IFDIR&lt;/code&gt; flag set&lt;/a&gt;

,
even if that macro does not even exist yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/v7unix/v7unix/blob/master/v7/usr/src/cmd/mkdir.c#L57&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;manually link the entry for the current directory &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; into that&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/v7unix/v7unix/blob/master/v7/usr/src/cmd/mkdir.c#L64&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;manually link the entry for the parent directory &lt;code&gt;..&lt;/code&gt; into that&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fragile and broken: &lt;code&gt;mkdir&lt;/code&gt; could be interrupted while
doing that or another program could try to race &lt;code&gt;mkdir&lt;/code&gt; while it
is doing that. In both cases we get directories that are invalid
and dangerous to traverse, because they break crucial
assumptions users make about directories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also before &lt;code&gt;readdir(2)&lt;/code&gt; and friends, so programs like
&lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/v7unix/v7unix/blob/master/v7/usr/src/cmd/ls.c#L304&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;open directories like files&lt;/a&gt;


and then make assumptions about the format of dentries on disk.
Specifically, they assume a 16 bit inode number and then a
filename of 14 characters or less and a directory that is an array
of these entries. Unfortunately, time has not been kind to the
assumption of 65535 files or less per partition, and also we
require filenames that are longer than 14 bytes these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally have a look at the hot mess that the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/v7unix/v7unix/blob/master/v7/usr/src/cmd/rmdir.c#L29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;rmdir&lt;/a&gt;


command is. What could probably go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/opheleon/status/1194941703632932865&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Jan Kraetzschmar&lt;/a&gt;


reminds us that this kind of non-atomic rmdir can also produce
structures in the filesystem that are disconnected from the main
tree starting at &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;. In that case you end up with orphaned, unreachable
inodes that still have a non-zero link count. &lt;code&gt;fsck&lt;/code&gt; should be
able to find them and free them, but of course that would be a
disruptive operation. Making &lt;code&gt;mkdir&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rmdir&lt;/code&gt; system call avoids
all of these problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why all of this was fixed in 1984 or so, when BSD
FFS came around and we got long filenames, wider inodes,
&lt;code&gt;mkdir&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rmdir&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;readdir&lt;/code&gt; as syscalls and many other
improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-if-really-everything-was-a-file&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-if-really-everything-was-a-file&#34;&gt;
	What if really everything was a file?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another decade later, around 1995 or so, we got Plan 9, not from
outer space, but from Bell Labs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It not only brought us Unicode everywhere, but also an
exploration of &amp;lsquo;What if really everything was a file?&amp;rsquo;,
including other machines on the network and processes on our
machine. From that we get todays
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs#/proc&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;procfs&lt;/a&gt;


in Linux (and in many other modern Unices).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except that you can&amp;rsquo;t &lt;code&gt;rm -rf /proc/1&lt;/code&gt; to shut down the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;things-that-still-are-not-a-file-and-should-be-dead&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#things-that-still-are-not-a-file-and-should-be-dead&#34;&gt;
	Things that still are not a file, and should be dead
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not going to mention System V IPC here at all. Not shm, not
sem, and not msq. They are abominations that should never have
escaped the lab cages they have been conceived in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;, and mmap is good. Or can be, as long as you do
not conflate in memory and on disk representations of data, and
understand the value of MVCC. But that is another story and
should be told another day.&lt;/p&gt;
