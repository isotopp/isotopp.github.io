      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ian Lance Taylor is the author of a UUCP program that I have been using for a long time to connect to other USENET systems, long before I had access to the actual Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UUCP queues up jobs for remote execution, dials other computers with a moden, exchanges the contents of the queued up work, and after disconnect executes the jobs. The jobs are mostly invocation of &amp;ldquo;rmail&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;rnews&amp;rdquo; programs for the exchange of mail and USENET news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taylors version of UUCP had large number of protocol and interface improvement that made it hugely superior, and that made working with &amp;ldquo;high speed modems&amp;rdquo; viable in the first place. It was the backbone of my network connectivity, 30 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taylor also wrote &amp;ldquo;a book&amp;rdquo; about program linkers in 2007, in the form of a long series of blog posts. In it, he explains what happens to a program after the compiler emits an object file, and before the program actually starts to run. That is, he describes how to the object file, system libraries and runtime become one thing that actually is capable of starting up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is deeply nerdy content, and also quite interesting, because it is widely underdocumented. Taylor&amp;rsquo;s series is key to making the obscure but vital topic better understandable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a book, but a series of blog posts. Fortunately, there is an &lt;a href=&#34;https://lwn.net/Articles/276782/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;index page&lt;/a&gt;

 made available by LWN. The parent article, on the Gold linker, is also &lt;a href=&#34;https://lwn.net/Articles/274859/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;at LWN&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>Social Networks and USENET</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2019/01/24/social-networks-and-usenet.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 24 Jan 2019 14:58:29 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2019/01/24/social-networks-and-usenet.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some thoughts on Social Networking and Usenet, in response to &lt;a href=&#34;https://jfm.carcosa.net/blog/computing/usenet/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://jfm.carcosa.net/blog/computing/usenet/&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of the impending shutdown of Google plus, some people reminisce about USENET, especially in the context of social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before being abused as a broadcast protocol for TV series, Porn and illegal copies of software, USENET was a kind of decentralized social media used for discussion.
There was a small number of interoperable server implementations, and a plethora of clients, with different audiences and optimisations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-did-usenet-work&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#how-did-usenet-work&#34;&gt;
	How did USENET work?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind USENET is that you have a very large number of servers that forward articles between each other, so that any user can post any article anywhere to any server, and eventually it would end up with exactly one copy of that article on each server that wants it.
Servers can have one or more connections with other servers, some had hundreds of links to other servers.
Message would ideally still be transported only once, and in no case stored multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A server keeps a message for a configurable amount of time, and eventually deletes the local copy as the expiration date of this message is being exceeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The format of any USENET post was superficially that of a (pre-multimedia) mail.
So a USENET article had a number of header lines as Key-Value pairs, broken according to mail long-line folding rules, and a body, which was ASCII text.
Later additions tried to improve on that, but failed - more about that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A somewhat basic usenet header would look somewhat like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;From: user@host (User Name)
Date: Thu, 24 Jan 2019 22:15:15 +0100
Path: news.nntp.dca.giganews.com!news.koehntopp.de!kris
Newsgroups: kiel.allgemein
Message-ID: &amp;lt;treXfsfeg17354@news.koehntopp.de&amp;gt;
In-Reply-To: &amp;lt;eueytdj2625@news.koehntopp.de&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few header keywords were more important than others, because without them the protocol would not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key header is the Message-ID:
It defines the identity of a message for purposes of the protocol &amp;ndash; two instances of a message are considered identical if they have the same ID, different if they ID is different.
It was crucial for all implementations to never modify a messages &amp;ldquo;Message-ID:&amp;rdquo; line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Servers know which messages they have already seen by keeping a list of Message-IDs in a special database, the server history table.
Servers would remember the IDs of messages longer than they would remember articles, and they would reject any message with any Message-ID that is even older than their history reaches back in time.
So a particular server might want to keep messages for 30 days, and a history table for 90 days.
That particular server would roundabout reject any message older than 90 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever a server sees a message young enough to qualify for lookup in the history table, it would do that lookup.
If the Message-ID is already known, a decision about this message had already been made in the past and the message is being rejected as a duplicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only when a message qualifies younger than the history, and as as-of-now unknown in the history, a decision about it (keep it, discard it, &amp;hellip;) has to be made.
In any case, the server would store the ID as &amp;ldquo;seen&amp;rdquo; in the history table and it would reject any second message with that ID.
That way duplicates from multiple connections are being recognized and eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allows a dense and redundant set of connections between servers without the need of any connection management or requirements on the server topology at all.
It would also allow a new server to connect to an existing server and request re-feeding any amount of old messages without the danger of accidentally feeding these old messages a second time to other existing servers over another link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it still is possible for a server with a hundred links to get dozens of copies of the same message through different links, all of which except for the first copy are being rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was particularly common for servers that did not have a live connection on the internet, but were batch fed:
Such servers would have their articles collected in a series of compressed files over the day, would then dial up using a modem and download the compressed batches in one go, multiple times a day.
After disconnection, they would decompress and process these articles, discarding any duplicates based on the Message-IDs and their history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interactive transfer on live internet lines was slightly more intelligent, and worked somewhat like two kids comparing collection cards.
One server would post Message-IDs of messages in &lt;code&gt;IHAVE&lt;/code&gt; statements, and the receiving server would look up these IDs in turn in their history.
Anything missing they would ask for with &lt;code&gt;SENDME&lt;/code&gt; messages, asking for new files by Message-ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to optimise this is the &amp;ldquo;Path&amp;rdquo; header line, which lists all the servers that have seen this copy of a message in order to traversal.
So a message posted to &lt;code&gt;news.koehnntopp.de&lt;/code&gt; by the user &lt;code&gt;kris&lt;/code&gt; would start out with a &amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;Path: news.koehntopp.de!kris&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo;.
That server would feed it for example to &lt;code&gt;news.nntp.dca.giganews.com&lt;/code&gt; and to &lt;code&gt;news.toppoint.de&lt;/code&gt;, so one copy of that message would end up with a &amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;Path: news.nntp.dca.giganews.com!news.koehntopp.de!kris&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo;, and the other would end up with &amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;Path: news.toppoint.de!news.koehntopp.de!kris&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo; in their Path.
Both copies of the original message would have divergent Path header lines, but identical Message-ID lines, and the same message body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Path line was being used to detect circles before they happen - you would not even offer anything that already has &lt;code&gt;news.koehntopp.de&lt;/code&gt; in the Path in any position back to &lt;code&gt;news.koehntopp.de&lt;/code&gt;.
Also, as a server operator you could do stats on Path lines to see which of your links was fast (brought you copies of messages first) and which would be slower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;message-selection&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#message-selection&#34;&gt;
	Message Selection
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how would a server operator get connections to other servers, and how would they decide which messages they want and not want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first of the weak points of USENET, and often glossed over in glorifying USENET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up a link between two servers was a completely manual process, and it was completely controlled by the upstream server feeding a downstream server with messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you had to manually discover a server wanting to act as a feed to you.
Often that was done with mailing lists where server operators and wannabe-server operators offered feeds, or asked for peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, after making contact, you would exchange contact information, and negotiate the parameters of setting up a link.
That required the exchange of login credentials, and the configuration of what the receiving server operator would want from the feed.
The upstream operator would manually configure these selection criteria and then send stuff to the receiver, which may or may not have been what these people wanted, and they could take that or discard it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is totally not what anybody would want today or back then.
There was no automated negotiation where the feeding server would advertise what they have, and the receiving server would then state interactively what they would want to subscribe to and what not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, all selection was based on another header line, the Newsgroup header.
So you could not express wishes based on language, author, content type, message-size or any other criteria.
You could only say you want messages &amp;ldquo;in kiel.allgemein and kiel.uni&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;in any kiel.* newsgroup&amp;rdquo; or exclusion criteria such as &amp;ldquo;kiel.&lt;em&gt;, but not kiel.binaries.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, server operators and end users where guarding newsgroups strongly - the creation and deletion of newsgroups was a heavily guarded process and misposting and crossposting - posting to the wrong newsgroup or posting to too many newsgroups at once - came attached with social stigma and sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made USENET very cumbersome for the end user.
Users that wanted social space and reach wanted a newsgroup.
But to get that they had to go through a very slow and formalised discussion process that was designed to keep the number of groups small and audiences in groups large and generalised.
Protected or small spaces, with a designed, non-public audience were frowned upon, making the creation of safe spaces hard or impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-client-dilemma&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-client-dilemma&#34;&gt;
	The client dilemma
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USENET clients were written as early versions of free software.
Their source was packaged and posted on USENET itself.
You would read a newsgroup that transported packaged software, and would find a new version of an end user client posted there.
You would unpackage the source, configure it for your system and compile it, and then try out the new program.
If it worked, you would roll out the new version on your systems for your end users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were many client programs.
Sven Guckes maintains a list at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.guckes.net/newsreaders/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://www.guckes.net/newsreaders/&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wide diversity in reading software also was a main cause of impediment in the evolution of USENET.
If a news reading program added features that required additional data in the header or the body of an article, all other reading programs would have problems decoding that.
Simple things as support for Umlauts for example required encoding of characters, because some systems broke Non-ASCII characters.
So &amp;ldquo;Kristian Köhntopp&amp;rdquo; was encoded as &amp;ldquo;Kristian =?iso-8859?Q?K=F6hntopp?=&amp;rdquo;.
While it was displayed properly in readers that supported decoding this, it was shown as &amp;ldquo;Kristian Iso-something-topp&amp;rdquo; to everybody else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting rich content, such as formatting in Markup or HTML, or inline-images into messages was even worse, because it made messages completely unreadable to users with clients that did not support these new formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, all extensions got heavy resistance from end-users and operators everywhere, and eventually USENET evolution stopped and everybody moved to web forums.
Essentially, USENET died with the appearance of phpBB and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-web-forum-software-won&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#how-web-forum-software-won&#34;&gt;
	How web forum software won
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web Forum software was, in the eyes of USENET users, a big step backwards.
It was not distributed, the client was primitive and put a lot of emphasis on presentation, and it was proscribed by the board operator instead of being a choice of the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But web boards were easy to upgrade:
With an upgrade, the same set of features was available to all users at once, and there was no possible resistance from users who were slow or negligent in upgrading their software.
Also, while you had to go through a slow and lengthy discussion process and voting process to get just one newsgroup, it was easy to get a web server with a copy of phpBB up and running and then you could run any number of groups on that.
Also, you controlled audience and admission, so it was possible to create protected safe spaces - by design an impossibility on USENET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end that made all but the most hardware tech audience move away from USENET rather quickly, and eventually USENET became irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;tldr&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#tldr&#34;&gt;
	TL;DR
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can not only learn from the successes of USENET, but even more from its failures.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Community Management?</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/08/23/community-management.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Aug 2017 21:58:52 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/08/23/community-management.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is a weird day. First thing is a friend asking about help with
community management. And next thing is Fefe reiterating his longstanding
fallacy (&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.fefe.de/?ts=a7634dce&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Rant in German&lt;/a&gt;

) that
programmers are able to do anything just because they are able to do one
thing (here: Community Management). The TL;DR is that he rants against
non-programmers showing interest into programming projects because they
like the software, thereby ruining everything by not being programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dabei ist es so einfach, sich in einem Projekt Respekt zu erarbeiten.
Leiste einfach was. Erwarte nichts als Gegenleistung. Problem: Jede Minute
über dich oder deine Leistungen reden macht 10 Minuten tatsächliche
Leistung kaputt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is easy to get respect in a project: Just show
something useful. Don&amp;rsquo;t expect a return. Problem: Every minute speaking
about yourself or your results ruins ten minutes of actual useful work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, of course, nonsense. It just shows, like his example about the
closed umatrix bug tracker, a complete lack of understanding of the
communication situation and a failure to organise the the communication
efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-dclp-experience&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-dclp-experience&#34;&gt;
	The dclp experience
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in late 1999, early 2000, I started a USENET newsgroup,
de.comp.lang.php. As the name suggests, it was a german language newsgroup
about the PHP programming language. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t the first communication
project I started, and I also had been online and in USENET quite some time,
and so I did it with an agenda and a plan
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2008/07/23/inhaltliche-und-kulturelle-steuerung-von-foren.html&#34;&gt;longer article&lt;/a&gt;

)
with German introduction and english language content about this).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point in time the German Linux newsgroups (and the German Firewall
newsgroups) were good counterexample to community management. There was
demand for drive-by support by newbies, but instead of dealing with the
demand, flamewars were the rule, and the spillover from the flamewars was
drowning the useful content of the group. Even with filters, the group was
impossible to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was my intention to actively discourage such a development in the newly
instantiated de.comp.lang.php. This was done by writing short, well
researched articles answering typical newbie questions, following a specific
short form recipe with a certain order of events. These answers were
collected, refined into a slightly more general form, and the reused to
answer recurring topical questions even faster. I set myself an arbitrary
time limit (no more than 60 minutes a day), and fell into a rote quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assumption was that people flaming noobs in the group were trying to
generate Karma by grabbing attention. By being able to usefully answer the
questions using short, well written articles with tested, reusable answers
and a recognisable form I would publicly grab more Karma and generate envy,
encouraging people to imitate me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other assumption was that the newbies are actually friendly, so if you
are perceived as friendly and helpful, you earn respect and authority, which
you can spend immediately to inject a second answer to a question they had
better asked, but didn&amp;rsquo;t, into their cognitive stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That did work, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short form was always a quote of the actual problem the noob had, an
optional rephrasing of the question into something clearer (&amp;ldquo;I understand
that as &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;) and then building a short, specific bridge pointing to a
specific answer in the FAQ, explaining in a single sentence why the FAQ
answer is relevant and how reading the answer will help in the context of
the actual question. If the noob showed behaviour unsuitable for USENET
regulars, I then often appended a sentence or two explaining the problem and
how it could be fixed to avoid future problems, or how to ask better
questions or similar improvements. The deal was &amp;ldquo;Remove their block, enable
them to continue, and then shove additional info into their mind that
improves &amp;rsquo;them&amp;rsquo; in a way that is useful to &amp;lsquo;us&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the proper tools and sticking to the form enables highly efficient
article generation: Within the allocated hour, I could generate easily 30-60
friendly, actually helpful, well tested answers and use the Karma to educate
noobs. I was also carpet bombing the group with useful content, drowning out
the flamers - the opposite of the Linux groups. And because I was
emotionally disengaged, professionally friendly all the time, I was able to
sustain that virtually infinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not invent that form - it was pre-existing and shown to work in a
slightly different way in comp.lang.c for a long time. Unlike the
de.comp.lang.php FAQ, the comp.lang.c FAQ also experienced a second
compression from FAQ to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/Expert-C-Programming-Deep-Secrets-ebook/dp/B00E0LASCU&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;actual book&lt;/a&gt;


by Peter van der Linden - I never found the time to do that (Read Peter&amp;rsquo;s
books, he&amp;rsquo;s an awesome explainer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-examples&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#other-examples&#34;&gt;
	Other examples
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the only way to manage communities, or maintain order in online
forums. I have an older talk about &amp;ldquo;Flames - Online Communication
Breakdowns&amp;rdquo;
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXD3vk9M7SQ&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;German video recording&lt;/a&gt;

)
which touches on experiences with de.comp.lang.php, but also on different
approaches chosen for de.rec.spiele.rpg.misc
(&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.azundris.com/output/rp/drsrm/faq/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;drsrm FAQ in German&lt;/a&gt;

) and de.talk.bizarre
(don&amp;rsquo;t look at &lt;a href=&#34;http://faqs.cs.uu.nl/na-dir/de/talk-bizarre/faq.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;dtb&lt;/a&gt;

,
that dtb is not the dtb you are looking for). I also explain why these
things require different approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is even more help available online, and some of it is even useful for
programmer-type minds.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/Building-Successful-Online-Communities-Evidence-Based-ebook/dp/B007RPF10U&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Building Successful Online Communities: Evidence-Based Social Design&lt;/a&gt;


is a collection of articles and case studies that shows different possible
approaches and what their applicability and usefulness is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a programmer-type mind,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/Social-Architecture-Building-line-Communities-ebook/dp/B01F8I7Z7E&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Pieter Hintjens Social Architecture: Building Online Communities&lt;/a&gt;


might be more useful for you. It just highlights how misguided,
helpless/clueless and badly implemented things like the umatrix bugtracker
shutdown or Fefe&amp;rsquo;s rant are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are useful tools to handle this, efficiently, out there, you just
don&amp;rsquo;t know them and you are making things worse with what you are doing
right now. So stop doing that, and learn what works, then follow that. And
fast, before you break it completely.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also,no, this is not about not at all about SJW inclusionists or project
maintainer privilege abuse. It&amp;rsquo;s about programmer-type persons not having an
appropriate repertoire of possible reactions to an influx of newcomers, and
then frustration, change-averseness and panic kicking in in this order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s also a normal thing, and there are ways to deal with this
appropriately as well - these are things that can be taught and learned, to
anyone who is willing to stop, understand that they are out of their depth
and then to listen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Damals, vor dem Internet und dem DSL, so um 1989 rum, da hatten wir Modems.
Mail wurde mit UUCP (Unix-to-Unix CoPy) übertragen.  Das heißt, man schrieb
eine Mail, und diese wanderte als Kopierauftrag in das UUCP Spooldirectory
des Systems.  Dort wartete sie, bis der Rechner eine Modem-Wählverbindung
aufgebaut hat (passierte so 1-3 mal am Tag) und wurde dann zum nächsten
System entlang der Kette kopiert.  Dort lag sie dann weiter, wartete auf die
nächste Wählverbindung und so weiter, bis sie irgendwann auf dem Zielrechner
angekommen war und dort lokal zugestellt wurde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das war sehr schnell: Oft war Mail schon am Absendetag auf dem Zielsystem
und wurde gelesen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bangaddressen&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#bangaddressen&#34;&gt;
	Bangaddressen
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mailadressen sahen so aus: &lt;code&gt;kriski!tpki!mcshh!thw (Thomas Wieske)&lt;/code&gt;.  Das ist
ein sogenannter Bangpath, wegen der ganzen Ausrufezeichen (Bang Sign).  Der
Bangpath gab die Schritte zum Zielsystem an, die mußte man wissen, und die
Adresse verkürzte sich mit jedem Schritt von links her.  O.a.  Adresse
bezeichnet also eine Zustellung an den Rechner &lt;code&gt;kriski&lt;/code&gt;, der die Mail dann
(minus den kriski-Part) an &lt;code&gt;tpki&lt;/code&gt; weiter kopierte, der sie an &lt;code&gt;mcshh&lt;/code&gt; weiter
kopiert hat, wo es einen lokalen User &lt;code&gt;thw&lt;/code&gt; gab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man kann auch im Kreis routen: &lt;code&gt;kriski!tpki!mcshh!unido!tpki!kriski!kris&lt;/code&gt; -
eine Mail an mich selber mit Umweg über &lt;code&gt;mcshh&lt;/code&gt; in Hamburg und &lt;code&gt;unido&lt;/code&gt; in
Dortmund.  Weil so was sinnlos ist und Geld kostet wurde so etwas nicht
gerne gesehen.  Außerdem nervt es natürlich, wenn man jeden Hopser der Mail
selber in die Adresse rein froggern muß.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also braucht man eine Notation für einen Verbindungsgraphen im Netz - &amp;ldquo;maps&amp;rdquo;
und ein Programm, daß aus diesem Graphen einen minimalen Spannbaum
berechnet, bei dem die Wurzel der eigene Systemknoten ist - &amp;ldquo;pathalias&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holger Koepke fand nun einen Mapschnipsel des Systems tpki von 1990, mit
einer Liste der Modems dran.  In einem Mapschnipsel stehen auch die Links,
also die Verbindungen zu den Nachbarknoten, mit Gewichten dran.  Hier ein
&lt;a href=&#34;http://groups.google.com/group/sub.config/browse_thread/thread/33abbbe7714b4b3b/9c31c38086d5c0c1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Mapschnipsel&lt;/a&gt;


von 1991:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;tpki    unido(DAILY+HIGH), smurf(DAILY+HIGH), abqhh(DAILY+HIGH),
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;        &amp;lt;ipkima&amp;gt;(DAILY+HIGH)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Das Schreiben von Mapschnipseln ist eine Wissenschaft, die verloren
gegangen ist: Je nachdem, welche Gewichte man seinen Links zugewiesen hat,
hat man den Traffic von Dritten auf sich gezogen, die Mail Transit durch die
eigene Kiste machen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setzte ich zum Beispiel hier das Gewicht von &lt;code&gt;unido&lt;/code&gt; und &lt;code&gt;smurf&lt;/code&gt; auf
&lt;code&gt;DEMAND&lt;/code&gt; (Verbindung ist instantan, nach Bedarf), würden viele andere Leute
ihre Mail mit der Sequenz &lt;code&gt;...!unido!tpki!smurf!...&lt;/code&gt;  durch mich hindurch
routen, weil das quasi ein Nullzeit-Transit ist, auch wenn es 3 Hops sind.
Das kostet aber leider Geld, und daher will man das meist nicht.  &lt;code&gt;ipkima&lt;/code&gt; zum
Beispiel hat sich dort oben mit den spitzen Klammern als Blatt ausgewiesen
und Transit abgelehnt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manchen Leuten war das mit den Gewichten und den Konsequenzen nicht ganz
klar - wenn jemand also seine frisch gebackene, arschteure X.25 Datex-P
Verbindung hatte, und dann in der Map seinen Schnipsel stolz auf &lt;code&gt;DEMAND&lt;/code&gt;
gesetzt hat, hat er also erst mal allen Mailtransit in Deutschland und dann
noch ein bischen auf sich gezogen.  Das konnten gigantische Trafficmengen -
einige hundert KB pro Tag!  - sein und einen in kürzester Zeit ruinieren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;trailblazer&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#trailblazer&#34;&gt;
	Trailblazer
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das Modem da in dem von Holger angesprochenen  Artikel (&amp;ldquo;Der hatte ein
Traiblazer, das hatte PEP!&amp;rdquo;) war ein ganz besonderes Teil, denn die Telebit
Trailblazer waren eine Gruppe von Modems mit einer ganz wunderbaren
Betriebsart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Reguläre&amp;rdquo; Modems erzeugen ein Signal, indem sie Phase und Frequenz eines
Signals ändern und so einen von 2, 4, 16 oder noch mehr Punkten in einem
Phasen-Frequenzdiagramm ansteuern.  Nach einer Weile wechselt das Signal und
die nächste Bitkombination wird übertrag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bei 2400 Signalwechseln pro Sekunde (Baud) und 16 Punkten = 4 Bit pro Signal
kann man 9600 Bit/s übertragen.  Das ist V.32 zum Beispiel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ist die Leitung gestört, sieht das visuell so aus, als seien diese Punkte,
die durch das Signal beschrieben werden, unscharf.  Werden sie so unscharf,
daß sie ineinanderlaufen, ist das Signal nicht mehr erkennbar und die
Übertragung gestört.  Das Modem muß dann auf eine langsamere Geschwindigkeit
runterschalten (&amp;ldquo;Renegotiation&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das bedeutet, daß das Modem einen Datenträgerton (&amp;ldquo;Carrier&amp;rdquo;) hat, der ein
relativ breites Frequenzband (ideal den gesamten zur Verfügung stehenden
Bereich) belegt.  Gibt es in diesem Bereich Dämpfungen oder - schlimmer noch -
eine Bandsperre oder Störung, etwa durch eine Schwebung, dann bricht die
Verbindung ab.  Auch dann, wenn eigentlich eine ganze Menge Restspektrum zur
Verfügung stünde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Trailblazer, in Deutschland mit Telebimm-Zulassung als MDG-19k2
verkauft, waren nun Modems, die statt eines einzelnen schnellen und
superbreiten Carriers sehr viele (512) Carrier gesendet haben, von denen
jeder 0, 2, 4 oder 6 Bit überträgt und die sehr langsam wechseln (6 mal pro
Sekunde).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6 Baud sind so langsam, daß man sie hören kann - ein Telebit-Modem erzeugt
ein sehr characteristisches Carrierwummern (&amp;ldquo;Wop Wop Wop Wop Wop Wop&amp;rdquo;).  Und
da die einzelnen Carrier sehr schmalbandig sind, kann man sie einzeln runter
regeln oder abschalten, wenn es Probleme gibt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwebungen oder andere Bandsperren machen einem Telebit also nix aus: Man
kann ohne Probleme mit einem Telebit einen gcc Source von Kiel nach Berlin
Ost (Node &amp;ldquo;pericont&amp;rdquo;) und anders herum schaufeln, auf einer Leitung, auf der
Schwebungen durch schlechte Richtfunkstrecken selbst Sprache schwer
verständlich machen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bestes Modem der Welt - voll geländegängig und schnell sogar auf
Datenfeldwegen!  &lt;strong&gt;vermiss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 contributed by Vladimir Htr)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, late in 1999, I was involved in the creation of de.comp.lang.php, a USENET newsgroup. Since the group was new I began a personal experiment to influence the communication culture of an &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2005/06/07/zehn-jahre-php.html&#34;&gt;open USENET group&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That went on for four to five year, out of which I have been actively involved for two years, earning &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2007/03/18/warum-alle-meine-texte-frei-im-netz-zu-lesen-sind.html&#34;&gt;good Karma&lt;/a&gt;

. But unfortunately &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.php-faq.de/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://www.php-faq.de/&lt;/a&gt;

 is now dead (or outdated and inactive).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my disk there was an old text, unpublished for many years, about the concept behind the engagement. I will just post it here, because the strategy might be salvaged and could be applied elsewhere to similarly structured environments. Other environments need different strategies, as shown in my talk about
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2007/02/11/flames-kommunikationszusammenbrueche-im-netz.html&#34;&gt;Flames&lt;/a&gt;

.
Some things shown below I would present differently today, but the core is solid. Maybe it is useful to someone?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#uplift-or-a-process-to-create-useful-usenet-newsgroups&#34;&gt;
	Uplift or A Process to Create Useful USENET Newsgroups
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by Kristian Köhntopp&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with apologies to David Brin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USENET is generally considered a medium with much noise and little useful
content. The claim is that the natural state of a USENET newsgroup is the
flamewar and that exceptions are rare and generally not worth bothering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article tries to establish that this observation need not be true and
presents the process of &amp;ldquo;Uplift&amp;rdquo; by which a newsgroup having &amp;ldquo;Potential&amp;rdquo; can
slowly be turned into a useful support forum with mostly intelligent
discussions and with procedures to stabilize that state to some extent. The
Uplift process has been tested over the period of one year with the german
language newsgroup de.comp.lang.php (3800 articles/month in September; 22500
articles overall until now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;newsgroup-history-and-some-past-experiences&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#newsgroup-history-and-some-past-experiences&#34;&gt;
	Newsgroup history and some past experiences
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;de.comp.lang.php was created 01-Jan-2000 by vote of the german USENET
community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RfD and CfV processes have been initiated by me because I saw a rising
number of PHP related messages in the german Linux newsgroups. Also, I was
subscribed to the german PHP mailing list
(&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.php-center.de/php-de/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://www.php-center.de/php-de/&lt;/a&gt;

) and I
was generally dissatisfied with the content and form of the forum. High
volume mailing lists are generally crude to manage and read and mail2news
gateways are only a substitute for the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the german Linux newsgroups were in a state of disarray
and displayed all the worst characteristics attributed to newsgroups in
general:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Newbies were coming into the group and asked the same
questions over and over, sometimes multiple times a day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regulars were fleeing the group, showing strong signs of burnout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flamewars were the rule, sometimes encouraged by regulars with burnout
symptoms which had not fled the group, yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because there was no group culture (except the default culture of flaming)
and because the groups had no memory, discussions in the group entered a
vicious cycle and did not improve nor shift topic. All action in the
groups converged on flaming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-goals-for-decomplangphp&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-goals-for-decomplangphp&#34;&gt;
	The goals for de.comp.lang.php
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHP is the most popular installed Apache module by far, and traffic on the
german mailing list as well as the support for the RfD showed that a
newsgroup on PHP would be a real success and become high-traffic within a
year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal was to prove the german Linux burnouts wrong, and demonstrate that a
newsgroup can be manipulated into being a mostly useful and friendly
discussion forum within four months, by giving helpful answers in a friendly
and helpful style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the group should create a number of regulars interested into
the group being useful within eight months. These regulars should ideally
copy the friendly and helpful style,  distributing load between each other
and setting an example for newbies and regulars-to-be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the group should be self-sustaining within twelve months after
inception. That is, there should be an established Uplift path for regulars
showing true Potential to become FAQ maintainers and active contributors to
the group culture. Ideally, after that year there would be little need for
myself to meddle with the groups sociodynamics. Also, the group would then
be ripe for split due to high traffic volume and the groups concept would
then be proven and could be applied to other groups as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-few-simple-building-blocks&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#a-few-simple-building-blocks&#34;&gt;
	A few simple building blocks
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central to the establishment of a group culture is the ability to remember
past discussions and their results. Without memory there is no past, and
without a past there can be no communal traditions and culture. The
fundamental building blocks of newsgroup Uplift are therefore the creation
of
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.php-faq.de/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Library&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;rdquo; and a process to spread its knowledge
widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of a USENET newsgroup, The Library is a frequently asked
questions document, which must be seeded initially over the period of two or
three months with the most needed knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the FAQ is fat. That is, it does not only cover truly frequent
questions, but also provides all background information needed to properly
handle and understand that frequently requested information. The strategy
is to get Clients reading and keep them reading, feeding them not only
solutions to the immediate problems, but also feed them parts of the larger
picture as well as basic USENET traditions and rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is necessary, because a client coming into the newsgroup with a PHP
related problem most of the time has other problems as well, such as a lack
of basic USENET etiquette and a lack in writing or debugging skills,
preventing the Client to state the problem in a correct or efficient way.
One of the first steps in the Uplift process must be to give the Client
speech, that is, to teach Clients essentials such as proper quoting
behaviour, realname policies, writing style, HTML and vCard policies and
similar stuff. Only with such knowledge the Client can integrate into the
USENET society and become a useful netizen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, a client coming into the newsgroup with an immediate problem
wants to hear solutions to that particular problem and is not interested in
being force-fed obscure traditions and customs. In order to overcome this
learning block, the immediate problem of the Client must be solved quickly
and to the point. If such a solution is being delivered in an answer
posting, though, the Client usually is receptive and can be fed one or two
bits of additional knowledge and culture as well. If this information is
being kept in the same document as the answer to the Clients&amp;rsquo; problem as
well, it will be accepted even easier by that Client. Thus, a fat FAQ is a
great help in the Uplift process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, a vast and fat FAQ is no target to point a client to. The client
has an &lt;em&gt;immediate&lt;/em&gt; problem and needs help urgently. Thus, a reference to The
Library should always be specific in nature, pointing the Client to the
properly phrased question, and containing the full URL of the answer. If the
question and the answer do not match the specific question of the Client in
full, it should be accompanied by some additional sentences of explanation,
showing the Client how to modify the Library provided answer in order to be
useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it is okay if the answer is not a perfect fit, especially
if the Client has already moved somewhat along the path of Uplift. We want
to create future Patrons assisting us in the Uplift of new Clients and
contributing to the FAQ, and this requires these future Patrons to be able
to work out solutions by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In de.comp.lang.php, the FAQ is kept at
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.php-faq.de/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://www.php-faq.de/&lt;/a&gt;

, and FAQ references often
have the form of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.16. Wie verweise ich auf die
FAQ?http://www.php-faq.de/q/q-newsgroup-faqreferenz.html&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;accompanied by some additional lines of explanation. This form of
reference to FAQ-able questions has been established very early after the
creation of the newsgroup, and has been adopted by almost all contributors
to the group with Patron capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;opening-the-culture-for-self-sustenance&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#opening-the-culture-for-self-sustenance&#34;&gt;
	Opening the culture for self-sustenance
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial FAQ was copyrighted by me. Although that FAQ was available by
CVS, and was written in an open format (LinuxDoc at that time), there was
little interest of potential contributors to add to the FAQ. The initial
problem was that some people tried to take the FAQ&amp;rsquo;s content and wanted to
edit and republish it for their gain, and that I made it very clear that
this was not acceptable by writing large COPYRIGHT notices all over the
text. Potential contributors had no interest to contribute to a text that
was clearly marked as the exclusive property of someone else. On the other
hand I did not want to give text away for uncontrolled republication and
modification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me four months to recognize that problem and to resolve it
satisfactorily. The license of the FAQ was changed at that time, and the
text is now available under the Open Publication License
(&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opencontent.org/openpub/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://www.opencontent.org/openpub/&lt;/a&gt;

),
which was found to balance all interests well enough to become accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, a mailing list was created to deliver FAQ commit messages and other
important events and to provide a forum for discussion that is more private
that the newsgroup itself. Thus, maintenance load is distributed between
all interested parties, preventing early burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the creation of the group, several problems arose which were not
sufficiently covered by the initial charta of the group. Such problems were
for example the handling of posted job offers within the group, or how to
deal with rapidly recurring on-topic questions of little value to regulars
such as &amp;ldquo;Which provider/editor/operating system can be recommended?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was important for the creation of a group culture that these problems
were resolved by a straw poll of the groups users themselves in order to
create a &amp;ldquo;we-experience&amp;rdquo;. Also, it was important to let the users first
experience the problem themselves before having them vote on it, because
common suffering enhances such &amp;ldquo;we-experiences&amp;rdquo;. On the other hand, such
resolutions must be found before the problem becomes so pressing that it
inhibits normal operation of the group. And finally, there should not be to
many such straw polls in rapid succession, in order to keep the audience
interested and in order to keep meta-discussions low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The straw polls were held at a rate of at most one per month, and the
alternatives were formulated as neutral as necessary for them to be
accepted. Still they were presented from a &amp;ldquo;Patron&amp;rdquo; point of view, by subtly
highlighting the possible consequences of this or that decision where
necessary. The outcome of the straw polls was documented in the first
chapter of the FAQ, along with descriptions of acceptable behaviour around
these topics and pointers to alternative or additional resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works reasonably well: 2 out of 3 atavistic throwbacks are usually
quickly terminated by pointing the Client to the proper FAQ article handling
such topics as provider recommendations, editor comparisons or language
advocacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job postings are usually not handled this way, because they are by nature
hit-and-run events in which a company drops a shower of job offers in a
number of newsgroups without caring about local group culture. Instead, these
matters are usually resolved by a mail to their given contact address
quoting the relevant FAQ article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article contains enough acid to drive to point home without being
outright unfriendly. In order to save duplicate work and prevent the
offender from being harassed by multiple community members, it is an
emerging tradition to copy such letters to the german-faq mailing list
enabling the contributing regulars to synchronize their activities. It is
also great fun to share the answers, improving the &amp;ldquo;we-experience&amp;rdquo; once
more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have yet to see second-time offenders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-does-it-work&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#why-does-it-work&#34;&gt;
	Why does it work?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Patrons, The Library makes it much easier to create useful answers by
referencing the FAQ than to write an intelligent flame. Once this is
understood by a contributing regular, the default stress reaction shifts
from flaming to writing short and constructive articles containing pointers
to the relevant information. This greatly improves the morale within the
newsgroup, as flaming creates more flaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Clients, reading the provided FAQ reference is easier than to go at it
again in a followup posting. Asking followup questions is more work and has
a higher round-trip-time than simply reading on and learning something. As
long as the FAQ anticipates the next question along the path and provides
stuff that is easily understandable and properly documented, the Client will
not ask again but try to achieve something alone. This enhances the Clients&#39;
ability to work independently, Uplifting it further. It also cuts down on
the total number of posts to the group, lightening the load for the
contributors of answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, FAQ solutions are tried and tested, have proper error handling and are
commented, making them more valuable than on-the-fly creations, thus the
Client will come to prefer FAQ quality answers over newsgroup quality
answers. It will turn to the FAQ immediately next time a problem arises,
becoming somewhat dependent on that information source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing FAQ pointers is a cheap way to gather Patron status for regulars, as
all components are available ready-made and need only deployment and slight
customization. Thus, even some recently Uplifted Client can begin to gather
Patron reputation by becoming a contributor of answers to the group. This
enables older Patrons to move on and perhaps become FAQ committers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrons becoming dependent on the library feel a growing desire to
contribute to The Library as soon as they hit holes multiple times when
writing answers. They feel that their business becomes significantly more
difficult in areas not covered by the FAQ, and start committing new answers
or even new chapters. Since all articles in the FAQ bear the name of the
Patron who created it, adding to the FAQ is a way to gain status more
permanently than by writing newsgroup articles: Unlike newsgroup answers
which expire quickly, FAQ contributions tend to stay and keep the Patrons
name in the light for a much longer time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This effectively creates two processes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One process takes answers and threads from the newsgroup and compresses them
to reusable, tested and tried articles. Context-dependent information from
a USENET thread, loosely distributed over multiple articles, becomes
context-independent, is peer reviewed and available in the much tighter
format of a FAQ article. This process improves information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second process is the process of Uplift, which educates contributors to
the group in USENET etiquette as well as in matters covered by the groups&#39;
charta, by turning them from Clients asking questions into Patrons providing
answers or even Senior Patrons contributing to the content of the FAQ. This
process improves people.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#dealing-with-atavism&#34;&gt;
	Dealing with Atavism
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USENET is showered with a constant rain of newbies. Usually, big loads of
newbies in a short time lead to group degeneration, spontaneous topic
combustion (&amp;ldquo;flamewars&amp;rdquo;) and loss of directed discussion activity at group
level. This phenomenon is called
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/S/September-that-never-ended.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;September&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;rdquo;
because before 1993 the month of September was the time when new students at
the Universities hit the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Uplift process provides means to newsgroup regulars to deal with a
larger number of newbies successfully, avoiding burnout and flamewars.
Uplifting converts newbies into useful netizens faster than usual, too, and
uses these fresh converts to deal with even newer newbies if applied
successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with an Uplift process in place, a newsgroup may experience occasional
atavistic throws. This is usually the case when a Patron experiences
burnout, and lets himself go publicly. Often this is provoked by a
particularly clueless newbie posting, or an outright flame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To deal with atavism and have it not ruin the groups&amp;rsquo; climate, it is
important to encourage Patrons to take their grievances to mail. This can be
done by using the FAQ maintenance mailing list, or by encouraging the Patron
to flame a newbie by mail and copy the flame to the FAQ maintenance mailing
list for the enjoyments of the others (and to inform than that this
particular case has been already taken care of). The german FAQ contains a
section titled&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.12 Warum bekomme ich Ermahnungsmails, wenn ich Autoren in der Gruppe auf
Netiquetteverstöße aufmerksam mache?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why do I get reminder mails, when I remind people publicly of netiquette violations?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and this one is listed BEFORE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.13 Warum bekomme ich Ermahnungsmails?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why am I mailed with netiquette reminders?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not acceptable for a Patron to display behaviour which cannot be
tolerated in Clients, and besides it does not help on-topic discussion in the
group if meta-discussion swamps the forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full answer to question 1.12 is (translated from German):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You are completely right: Some authors in this group violate the
netiquette as posted to de.newusers.infos, for example by posting without
a realname, by using invalid reply addresses or by posting HTML or vCards.
You need not tolerate this. In newsgroups, tone is as important as
content, though. The regulars of de.comp.lang.php are proud of the
friendly and helpful tone in their newsgroup. So if you want to remind
another author to keep to the netiquette, please do this by mail and not
in public. The very netiquette you are trying to enforce requires this -
you cannot validly demand conformity with this convention, and at the same
time violate it yourself without losing credibility. Please: Keep your
tone friendly in your mail as well. You are easier understood this way,
and it is more likely that you complete your mission this way. If you
believe that your article must be posted in public, for example in order
to forward discussion to another newsgroup, or because the mail address
given is invalid, or because the author in question has not been
cooperative in mail: Please keep your article friendly and constructive.
That is: Answer the question of the offender or offer a solution to his
problem as good as possible. Only after that remind him about the
netiquette. If you cannot contribute to the original problem, do not post
or write mail. You are not alone in this group, and you do not need to save
the world alone. Somebody else who knows the proper answer will write a
public reply and probably will remind the original author of proper
behaviour.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This take-it-to-mail policy has been in force since beginning of March 2000,
and has been enforced several times since then between the regulars and by
themselves. Obviously the regulars in this group like the climate and tone
of their group and accept the offered conflict resolution solution as a
viable mode to deal with the problem and with offenders. Flamewars seldom
last for more than a day or two, if they happen at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important for the users of the newsgroup to learn how to deal with
flames properly, taking them as failed attempts to communicate instead of
insults, and coolly pointing the offender to the relevant resources to help
him state his problem correctly. The answer to 1.13 translates as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Not only in de.comp.lang.php, but in most other German newsgroups you
will be reminded of proper behaviour in newsgroups, if you post without a
proper realname, with an invalid return address, send unwanted
advertisements, post HTML or vCards, or post offtopic on purpose. The
oldtimers and regulars of USENET did not come up with their rules and
traditions for nothing. USENET has been in existence for some tens of
years, and the rules of communication on USENET have been proven in over
this time. There is an introduction in de.newusers.infos titled &amp;lsquo;Why
should I stick to the rules?&amp;rsquo; explaining why things are as they are and
how they came to be. If you want results from posting to de.comp.lang.php,
that is, if you expect technical help with PHP, you are well advised to
watch the outer form of your text and honor our traditions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two texts are usually sufficient to calm down the offender and the
flaming Patron and to tie them into one or two mail exchanges discussion
their behavior and offering counseling. Having shared the experience and
providing hints to deal with frustration is helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes productive behaviour emerges from such a mail exchange, making
this counseling rewarding for the person sending the mail. For example the
formerly flaming Patron may become motivated to work on the FAQ, or take up
another project which he believes would help him to compensate his anger.
The publicly visible component of the flamewar is usually silenced
immediately after the mail exchange starts, with sometimes some erroneous
postings by third parties coming in late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-learned&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#lessons-learned&#34;&gt;
	Lessons Learned
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is possible to take control of the content and the traditions of a
USENET newsgroup for an extended amount of time, if the perceived change for
the majority of the regulars is a change for the better.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_The tools for affecting the change are the creation of a recorded tradition
by the creation of a FAQ, making proper and improper behavioral standards
explicit and addressable for reference in a discussion, and a specific
procedure for teaching these standards to newcomers. This specific procedure
involves taking the newcomers&amp;rsquo; problem seriously, solving it and pushing
additional corrective information with that answer in a non-offensive and
non-degrading way at the newcomer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Materialsammlung &#34;Mittlerfreie Kommunikation&#34;</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2005/05/10/materialsammlung-mittlerfreie-kommunikation.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2005 05:12:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2005/05/10/materialsammlung-mittlerfreie-kommunikation.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Das Thema &amp;ldquo;Mittlerfreie Kommunikation&amp;rdquo; ist ein Komplex von Gedanken, mit dem
ich mich im Laufe der Jahre immer wieder auseinandergesetzt habe und das mir
in einer ganzen Reihe von Diskussionen immer wieder begegnet ist. Weil dabei
jedesmal dieselben URLs raussuchen muß, habe ich sie mir hier einmal als
Zusammenfassung weggebloggt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ausgangspunkt war eine
&lt;a href=&#34;http://kris.koehntopp.de/inkomploehntopp/00951.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Diskussion im Usenet in 1997&lt;/a&gt;

,
wo jemand behauptete, daß sich das Medium Buch in den letzten paar tausend
Jahren nicht geändert habe. Ich fühlte mich gezwungen, zu widersprechen: Das
Aussehen von Büchern mag sich wenig geändert haben, aber die Art und Weise,
wie sie produziert werden, hat sich massiv geändert. Und diese Änderungen
sind eine Quelle von weitreichenden Struktur- und Gesellschaftsänderungen
gewesen (bzw. sind es immer noch). Der Artikel verwendet den Begriff der
&amp;ldquo;Publishing Pipeline&amp;rdquo;, den ich später zum Begriff des &amp;ldquo;Mittlers&amp;rdquo;
verallgemeinert habe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein Mittler ist in einer Kommunikation jemand, der am Zustandekommen dieser
speziellen Kommunikation beteiligt ist, der also diese spezielle
Kommunikation inhaltlich beeinflussen kann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Im Rahmen der immer wiederkehrenden
&lt;a href=&#34;http://groups-beta.google.com/group/de.admin.news.misc/msg/2167033d3858f411&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Zensurdiskussionen (hier: Oktober 1998)&lt;/a&gt;


gehe ich darauf ein, daß solche Mittler in der Vergangenheit auch eine
gesellschaftlich wichtige Kontrollfunktion wahrgenommen haben. Diese
Kontrollfunktion fällt jetzt weg, wenn die Vermittlungstätigkeit zu einer
Infrastrukturtätigkeit wird, der Mittler also nicht mehr am Zustandekommen
einer einzelnen Kommunikation beteiligt ist, sondern nur noch allgemein eine
Kommunikationsplattform betreibt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Wegfall dieser dieser Kontrollfunktion führt unter anderem dazu, daß
diejenigen Parteien, die sich bisher auf die Kontrollfunktion der Mittler
verlassen haben nun versuchen, den Betreiber der Infrastruktur für die
Inhalte verantwortlich zu machen, die über sie transportiert werden
(Stichwort &amp;ldquo;Providerverantwortung&amp;rdquo; und &amp;ldquo;Providerhaftung&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Etwas früher, im Juni 1998, schrieb ich etwas über die
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fitug.de/debate/9806/msg00657.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Auswirkungen von Infrastruktur in Händen der Endnutzer&lt;/a&gt;

 -
das ist letztendlich der Gedanke, der hinter P2P steht. Im Artikel gehe ich
noch von &amp;ldquo;dauernd laufenden Servern beim Endanwender&amp;rdquo; aus, und diskutiere,
welche Auswirkungen diese auf die Publikationsmöglichkeiten von Endanwendern
haben und wie dies im Kontext der Theorie der mittlerfreien Kommunikation zu
sehen ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So redet der Text noch von &amp;ldquo;Bandbreite zu Hause&amp;rdquo; aus, aber letztendlich ist
das irrelevant - heute haben wir nicht nur DSL-Bandbreiten nach Hause,
sondern wir haben auch nahezu unbegrenzt Speicher außerhalb des Hauses in
Form von Webdav-Diensten, Fotoalblem, Onlinespeichern und
Webmail-Postfächern, von traditionellen kostenlosen Webhosting-Angeboten gar
nicht zu reden&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lustigerweise macht der Text eine Kostenvorhersage, die - wenn man sie heute
nachrechnet und die Inflation auch noch berücksichtigt - tatsächlich
einigermaßen bei den Kosten für einen DSL-Anschluß herauskommt. Zwei
Megabit/sec ist das, was die Uni Kiel zur Zeit meines Studiums zur
Versorgung der ganzen Universität bereitgestellt hat - aber nicht zu den
Kosten eines DSL-Anschlusses, sondern für Tausende von DM&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Im April 2000 taucht das Thema wieder auf. Diesmal geht es um
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fitug.de/debate/0004/msg00514.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Industriealisierung von Kommunikation&lt;/a&gt;

.
Was bedeutet dieser Begriff?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In industrieller Kommunikation finden sich die Kommunikationspartner
gegenseitig ohne vorherige Kenntnis ihrer Existenz und ohne vorher ihre
Vertrauenswuerdigkeit oder die Ernsthaftigkeit der gegenseitigen Angebote
abschaetzen zu koennen. Dieses Finden kann ueber industrielle Vermittlung,
also durch Suchmaschinen und ueber reputation managers
(&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.useit.com/alertbox/990905.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://www.useit.com/alertbox/990905.html&lt;/a&gt;

)
erfolgen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es geht auch um die Frage, wer überhaupt ein Interesse daran haben kann, ob
zwei Personen ohne Kontrolle durch einen Mittler oder Filter miteinander
kommunizieren dürfen und wieso das eine wichtige Frage ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zum Ausspruch &amp;ldquo;The Internet treats censorship as damage &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; von John
Gilmore: Das ist die historisch-kaltkriegerische Formulierung des obigen
Sachverhaltes - &amp;ldquo;MittlerfreieKommunikation&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;und&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ldquo;freie Wahl des
Kommunikationsmodus&amp;rdquo; sind es, die eine Informationsgesellschaft
tatsaechlich definieren.In einer solchen Gesellschaft kann Regulierung nur
beim Sender oder beim Empfaenger ansetzen. Wenn bei diesen beiden Parteien
keine Kooperation besteht, wird es extrem schwierig werden, die
Beruecksichtigung dritter Interessen zu erzwingen. Und das ist genau der
Grund, warum &amp;ldquo;Besitz der Privatsphere&amp;rdquo; das Wohlstand definierende
Kriterium der Informationsgesellschaft ist wie &amp;ldquo;Besitz von
Produktionsmitteln&amp;rdquo; das Wohlstand definierende Kriterium der
Industriegesellschaft war und &amp;ldquo;Besitz von Land&amp;rdquo; das Wohlstand definierende
Kriterium der Agrargesellschaft.Durchdenkt man das zum Ende, fuehrt dies
zwingend dazu, dass wir den Begriffen &amp;ldquo;Privatsphaere&amp;rdquo; und &amp;ldquo;Datenschutz&amp;rdquo;
viel umfassendere Bedeutung zumessen muessen, als dies im derzeitigen
Datenschutzmodell und -recht in Deutschland bzw. in der EU bisher der Fall
ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ebenfalls aus dem April 2000 stammt ein Artikel zum Thema
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fitug.de/debate/0004/msg00561.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Jugendschutzfilter&lt;/a&gt;

 unter
dem Gesichtspunkt, daß diese Zwangsmittler sind. Der Artikel ist
stellvertretend für die ganze Jugendschutzdiskussion ausgewählt und geht das
Thema Mittler, Skalierung von Kontrollmechanismen und poltiische
Kontrollziele unter diesem Gesichtspunkt &amp;ldquo;Jugendschutz&amp;rdquo; an, aber die
Gedanken sind im Grunde verallgemeinerbar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schließlich taucht das Thema im Januar 2003 noch einmal auf. Um das Thema
&amp;ldquo;Zensur, Filterung und Zugangskontrolle&amp;rdquo; korrekt zu behandeln, fordere ich,
die Fragen korrekt zu formulieren. Die Frage, die eine Gesellschaft sich
stellen muß, lautet:
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fitug.de/debate/0301/msg00303.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Wollen wir mittlerfreie Kommunikation zulassen?&lt;/a&gt;


Die Frage, die auch kommen muß: Ist das Konzept des Zwangsmittlers technisch
und rechtlich durchsetzbar? Ist es gesellschaftlich erwünscht?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Abschied aus dem USENET</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2005/02/15/abschied-aus-dem-usenet.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2005 20:08:30 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2005/02/15/abschied-aus-dem-usenet.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Das älteste Posting, das Google Groups von mir hat, ist
&lt;a href=&#34;http://groups-beta.google.com/group/sub.config/msg/1b2b1a01e36f92e9?dmode=source&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;von Mitte 1989&lt;/a&gt;

.
Ich schrieb damals als &lt;code&gt;kris@tpki.UUCP&lt;/code&gt; aka &lt;code&gt;...!mcshh!tpki!kris&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Für die mit der Gnade der späten Geburt gesegneten:
Damals hatten wir noch kein automatisches Routing und auch keine direkten Verbindungen wie im Internet.
Mail wurde über Modem-Links von System zu System weitergegeben.
Da wir kein automatisches Routing hatten, musste man mit dem sogenannten Bang-Path (wegen der Ausrufezeichen, Bang!) die Systeme angeben, über die die Nachricht transportiert wurde.
&lt;code&gt;...!mcshh!tpki!kris&lt;/code&gt; ist also der Pfad zu meiner Mailbox ab dem damals relativ bekannten System mcshh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hostnamen waren weltweit eindeutig, da es noch keine Domains gab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systeme mussten sogenannte Mapschnipsel veröffentlichen, in denen sie ihren Namen und ihre Verbindungen zu anderen Systemen bekannt gaben.
Ein Eintrag wie &lt;code&gt;oski  tpki(DAILY)&lt;/code&gt; deklarierte dann eine Verbindung zwischen den Systemen &lt;code&gt;oski&lt;/code&gt; und &lt;code&gt;tpki&lt;/code&gt;, die einmal pro Tag Mail abgeholt hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mit dem Programm &lt;code&gt;pathalias&lt;/code&gt; konnte man die Liste der Mapschnipsel nehmen und in Routingtabellen der Form &lt;code&gt;oski kriski!tpki!oski!%s&lt;/code&gt; umgewandelt werden.
Diese Tabellen stellten das Netz aus der Sicht des Absenders dar, sodass eine Mail an &lt;code&gt;olaf@oski&lt;/code&gt; automatisch in den Bang &lt;code&gt;kriski!tpki!oski!olaf&lt;/code&gt; umgewandelt werden konnte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zusammen mit den Mails wurden über die Modemverbindungen damals auch die USENET News ausgetauscht.
Damals hatte man in der Regel einen lokalen News-Server auf seinem System laufen und die eingehenden News wurden eingelesen und auf dem lokalen News-Server bereitgestellt.
Abgehende Artikel wurden lokal auf dem eigenen System veröffentlicht und auf allen angeschlossenen Systemen verbreitet.
Weil jeder Artikel eine eindeutige ID hatte, konnte ein System erkennen, ob ihm ein Artikel mehrfach zugestellt wurde und Duplikate verwerfen.
Artikel haben sich so im &amp;ldquo;Flood-Fill Verfahren&amp;rdquo; im Netz ausgebreitet und waren in tausenden Kopien auf allen Servern verfügbar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Für mich waren USENET News und Mail damals der Einstieg ins Netz - lange vor Internet und drei Jahre vor der Erfindung von http.
Sie waren für mich auch lange Zeit das primäre Kommunikationsmedium und ich habe über die viele aufregende Personen kennengelernt - die Teilnehmer an der Silvesterfeier des Hohen Rathes der Dreizehn Weisen vom Feed werden sicherlich wissen, was ich meine.
Zu dieser Channelparty^W^Wdiesem Newsgrouptreffen von &lt;code&gt;de.talk.bizarre&lt;/code&gt; am 31.12. hatte ich rund 20 Leute nach Kiel eingeladen, die ich noch niemals vorher in Persona gesehen hatte und die sich auch untereinander dort größtenteils zum ersten Mal getroffen haben.
Das war eine wirklich gute Feier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heute brät USENET meistenteils im eigenen Saft - die Diskussionen dort sind alt, ich habe sie in den vergangenen 16 Jahren meiner Anwesenheit dort viele Male gesehen.
Erst neulich habe ich mein Zugangspaßwort für &lt;code&gt;news.individual.net&lt;/code&gt; wiedergefunden und erstaunt gemerkt, daß ich es für zwei Monate verloren hatte - ich hatte nicht einmal bemerkt, daß es dem Reader aus der Konfiguration gerutscht war, weil ich ihn schlicht nie aufgerufen habe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heute lese ich auf
&lt;a href=&#34;http://news.individual.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;news.individual.net&lt;/a&gt;

,
daß mein Zugang dort in Zukunft Geld kosten wird und eine Neuanmeldung erforderlich ist.
Der Betrag ist angenehm niedrig - 10 Euro pro Jahr (!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dennoch habe ich beschlossen, daß der 31. März 2005 der letzte Tag meiner Anwesenheit in den USENET News sein wird - es ist die Mühe nicht mehr wert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mein Reader ist inzwischen Akregator, und wer mit mir diskutieren will, der kann das in den Kommentaren meines Blogs tun oder mich trackbacken.
Blogs kann man haufenweise schnell und einfach bekommen - supersized.org ist möglicherweise nicht die schlechteste Wahl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In diesem Sinne: 16 Jahre sind genug. Lebewohl, USENET!&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2004 18:01:46 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2004/02/12/wir-sind-so-geil.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wir sind so geil,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.supergarv.de/serendipity/archives/311_s9y_Individualisierter_RSSFeed_per_Conditional_Get.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;wir sprechen XML&lt;/a&gt;

.
Nicht irgendein XML, nein, sogar RSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicht, daß mich jemand falsch versteht: Ich liebe S9Y und ich respektiere
Garvins Arbeit. Es ist nur einer dieser Tage, an denen ich glaube, daß ich
mich an den Kopf fassen muß.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Da sitzt ein Haufen Leute aufeinander und schwallt sich mit &amp;ldquo;Blogriffen&amp;rdquo; und
Wortblödungen zu, daß
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.naomiwatts.info/serendipity/archives/104_Blogwhat__Blogroll_blogarama_blogtree_blogwise_blogcheck_blogoo.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;nicht nur mir&lt;/a&gt;


ganz blümerant im Schädel wird. Oder
&lt;a href=&#34;http://blogosfear.org/eintrag.php?id=29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;wundert sich öffentlich&lt;/a&gt;

, warum
nicht mehr Leute bloggen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aber es ist nicht nur der Technobabble-Dummlall, der in der Szene
rumschwappt, der dies alles schwierig macht. Es ist nicht nur die
verwirrende Vielfalt von nicht richtig durchdachten und nicht richtig
interoperablen Formaten mit Versionsnummern, die sich
&lt;a href=&#34;http://uckan.info/wasistrss.htm#a1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;nur in Hundersteln unterscheiden&lt;/a&gt;

, aber
alle mit 0 anfangen. Es ist auch nicht, daß diese Formate weder richtig
spezifiziert sind, noch die Inhalte in diesen sogenannten Formaten in den
meisten Fällen richtig validiert sind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es ist auch noch so, daß sich diese ganze Technik wie Dreck skaliert. Da
habe ich nun also einen dieser megageilen RSS-Aggregatoren, die nur unter
Windows zu kriegen sind und kann endlich 378 Blogs auf einmal lesen, ohne
dabei sterben zu müssen (&lt;a href=&#34;http://beissholz.de/pivot/entry.php?id=178&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Manche Nisis&lt;/a&gt;

 behaupten das
ginge). Und dann pollt sich mein Feedreader bei 378 Sites tot, die alle
sowieso nur alle Jubeljahre eine Änderung haben?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nein&amp;rdquo;, höre ich da die Blog-Apologeten rufen, &amp;ldquo;das brauchst Du nicht, denn
wir pingen ja einen von fünf Millionen Blogroll-Aggregator-Services, wenn es
was neues gibt.&amp;rdquo; Richtig, S9Y macht das sogar mit allen fünf Millionen
gleichzeitig, wenn man will (Ok, es ist derzeit eine noch gerade mal
einstellige Zahl). &amp;ldquo;Hier!&amp;rdquo;, brüllt mein Blog, &amp;ldquo;Mein Meister hat was neues
geschrieben.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nur, wenn ich den Code in S9Y richtig gelesen habe, macht es genau dies -
kein Stück mehr Informationsgehalt. Es wird der tatsächliche Content meines
Eintrages nicht an den gepingten Service geposted. Dann kann er auch nicht
von dort runtergeladen werden, sondern muß direkt von meinem Blog geholt
werden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es wird nicht mal eine eindeutige ID generiert, oder die URL des neuen
Eintrages abgeliefert, nur die Base-URL des Blogs und ggf. die Base-URL des
RSS-Feeds. Also kann sich ein Client vom Pingservice nicht einmal eine Liste
der Einträge, die neu sind, runterladen, sondern muß sich das einzeln von
den Blogs geben lassen. Wieviel schlauer wäre es, den Content gezippt im
Batch direkt vom Pingservice zu ziehen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garvin schreibt jetzt in seinem Artikel, daß man auch den RSS-Feed eines
Blogs normal nicht nach &amp;ldquo;alle Artikel seit dem x.y.2004&amp;rdquo; fragen kann, oder
alle Artikel seitdem URL z veröffentlicht wurde&amp;quot;. Man kann auch nicht sagen
&amp;ldquo;Ich hab schon r, s, t, x, y, z&amp;rdquo; und das Blog antwortet &amp;ldquo;Dann fehlen Dir u,
v und w&amp;rdquo;. Jeder
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1036.txt&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;NNTP-Server&lt;/a&gt;

 kann das, schon seit den
80ern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Je mehr ich über die sogenannte Blogosphere lerne, desto weniger beeindruckt
bin ich. Wenn Ihr schon USENET in bunt neu erfindet, dann denkt doch bitte
vorher 15 Sekunden nach, wie ihr Eure Formate spezifiziert, wie sie sich
skalieren und wie man sie validiert - nichts von dem habt Ihr gemacht.
Selbst ZCONNECT hat mehr Hirnschmalz in seine Strukturen investiert als
dieser Haufen mausschubsender Scriptkiddies, die das definieren, was
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iht.com/articles/126768.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Konferenzen wie Davos&lt;/a&gt;

 bis zur
Unbrauchbarkeit für sinnvolle Themen dominiert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So aber kann ich Euch nur ein fröhliches
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iks-jena.de/mitarb/lutz/usenet/Fachbegriffe.der.Informatik.html#67&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;FdI #67&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;zusammenfassung&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#zusammenfassung&#34;&gt;
	Zusammenfassung
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wie alle anderen Medien wird auch das Internet zur Verbreitung von beispielsweise rechtsradikalen oder kinderpornographischen Informationen mißbraucht. Dies hat in letzter Zeit den Ruf nach einem staatlichen Eingriff laut werden lassen, um zentrale Sperrungen bestimmter Inhalte zu erreichen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Autoren halten einen solchen Schritt fuer nicht angemessen. Zum einen haben bisher alle technischen Ansätze zur Realisierung versagt. Strukturelle überlegungen lassen vermuten, daß dies auch in Zukunft der Fall sein wird. Auf der anderen Seite haben Sperren stets Auswirkungen auch auf Bereiche, deren Sperrung nicht beabsichtigt ist. Diese Nebenwirkungen sind um so schwerwiegender, je wirksamer die Sperren sein sollen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dezentrale Lösungsansaetze können dem Nutzer die Möglichkeit geben, im eigenen Bereich selbstverantwortlich Inhalte zu filtern. Bewertungen von Inhalten durch nichtstaatliche Organisationen können dazu führen, daß der Bewertungsmechanismus zur Durchsetzung fragwürdiger Interessen mißbraucht wird. Um diesem Risiko entgegenzuwirken, ist es unverzichtbar, daß nicht nur die Bewertungsmaßstäbe, sondern auch die Bewertungen selbst vollständig offengelegt werden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jede Art von staatlicher Regulierung treibt die Kosten in die Höhe. Es ist abzusehen, daß der Versuch, Inhalte im Internet zu bewerten, sehr personalintensiv sein wird. Bereits heute sind die Kommunikationskosten am Standort Deutschland wesentlich höher als bei konkurrierenden Nationen wie den USA. Regulierungen können daher zu einem Standortnachteil führen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;was-soll-mit-einer-sperrung-erreicht-werden&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#was-soll-mit-einer-sperrung-erreicht-werden&#34;&gt;
	Was soll mit einer Sperrung erreicht werden?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bevor man über technische Maßnahmen zur Sperrung von Inhalten im Internet und die Chancen ihrer Realisierung reden kann, muß man sich darüber klar werden, welche Ziele man mit einer solchen Sperrung erreichen möchte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mögliche Ziele sind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Law Enforcement:&lt;/strong&gt; Man möchte verhindern, daß nach den Kriterien einer nationalen oder regionalen Rechtsordnung strafrechtlich relevantes Material für die Subjekte dieser Rechtsordnung erreichbar ist bzw. von ihnen veröffentlicht werden kann, und zwar auch dann, wenn der Ort der Veröffentlichung außerhalb des Durchsetzungsbereiches dieser Rechtsordnung liegt. Traumziel wäre es, das Begehen solcher Straftaten technisch unmöglich zu machen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indecency:&lt;/strong&gt; In den USA wurde mit dem &lt;em&gt;communication decency act&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;CDA&lt;/em&gt;) in seinen verschiedenen Formulierungen und Gesetzesvorlagen versucht, eine noch weitergehende Regelung zu etablieren: Es sollte verboten werden, Material über Datennetze zugänglich zu machen, das &lt;em&gt;indecent&lt;/em&gt; ist, d.h. nach den Grundsätzen der jeweils herrschenden Moraldefinition ungehörig, obszön oder in anderer Weise störend (zu Free Speech siehe z.B. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eff.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt;

 EFF).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jugendschutz:&lt;/strong&gt; Nur Minderjährigen (Kindern und Jugendlichen) soll der Zugang zu bestimmten Materialien verwehrt werden, während Volljährigen weiterhin die gesamten Inhalte des Internet zugänglich bleiben sollen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rating:&lt;/strong&gt; Für jeden Teilnehmer im Netz soll weiterhin frei definierbar sein, welches Material empfangen/nicht empfangen werden soll, aber es soll eine Bewertungsstruktur geschaffen werden, die es jedem Konsumenten in  eigener Verantwortung ermöglicht, seine Präferenzen anzugeben (kein Sex/viel Sex, keine Gewalt/Blood and Splatter, politisch links/politisch rechts, konform mit den Vorstellungen der katholischen Kirche/islamisch korrekt) und nur noch den Ausschnitt aus dem Internet wahrzunehmen, der diesen selbstgewählten Filter passieren kann.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nichtregulation:&lt;/strong&gt; Jeder Netzteilnehmer soll freien Zugriff auf alle angebotene Information haben. Sogar die Existenz von Bewertungskriterien Dritter wird als schädlich angesehen und die Bildung einer Bewertungsinfrastruktur nicht gefördert bzw. sogar behindert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;welche-dienste-werden-betrachtet&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#welche-dienste-werden-betrachtet&#34;&gt;
	Welche Dienste werden betrachtet?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unter der Bezeichnung &lt;em&gt;Inhalte im Internet&lt;/em&gt; wird in der Regel eine ganze Reihe von Diensten subsumiert, die technisch vollkommen unterschiedlich realisiert werden und administrativ zu großen Teilen disjunkte Strukturen aufweisen. Allen Diensten ist lediglich gemeinsam, dass ihnen das Datenübertragungsprotokoll TCP/IP zugrunde liegt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man muß mindestens die beiden folgenden Dienste unterscheiden:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WWW, World Wide Web:&lt;/strong&gt; Das World Wide Web ist der graphisch ansprechendste Dienst des Internet. Es handelt sich um Server, die auf die Anfrage eines Benutzers Seiten beliebigen Inhaltes an das Darstellungsprogramm (&lt;em&gt;Browser&lt;/em&gt;) auf seinem Rechner ausliefern. Der Zugriff auf diese Seiten erfolgt in der Regel mit Hilfe des HyperText Transport Protocol (&lt;em&gt;HTTP&lt;/em&gt;). Dieses Protokoll erfordert keine Identifizierung oder Authentisierung des Abrufers und des Anbieters; die Daten werden im Klartext und nicht fälschungssicher übermittelt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eine optional einsetzbare Modifikation von HTTP übermittelt
Anfragen und Antworten mit Hilfe des Verschlüsselungsverfahrens &lt;em&gt;Secure Socket Layer&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SSL&lt;/em&gt;). Bei diesem Verfahren muß sich mindestens der Anbieter gegenüber dem Abrufer identifizieren. Weiterhin ist sichergestellt, daß die Verbindung nicht im Klartext abhörbar ist (Dritten wird nicht bekannt, welche Anfragen gestellt wurden oder welche Inhalte die ausgelieferten Seiten haben) und daß Inhalte nicht durch Dritte während der übertragung unerkannt verfälscht werden können.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die abgerufenen Seiten bestehen aus Formatierungsanweisungen der &lt;em&gt;HyperText Markup Language&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;HTML&lt;/em&gt;) und optional weiteren Bild-, Ton- oder Videodaten. Bei kleineren Servern liegen die abrufbaren Seiten häufig statisch als vorgefertigte und unverändert ausgelieferte Dateien auf der Festplatte vor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Größere Server erzeugen die Seiten jedoch oftmals dynamisch in Abhängigkeit von der Identität des Abrufers, seiner Netzadresse, seiner bevorzugten Landessprache (im Browser konfigurierbar), dem vom Abrufer verwendeten Browsertyp, der Uhrzeit des Abrufs oder anderen Kriterien, die frei progammierbar sind. Es ist also nicht sichergestellt, daß zwei aufeinanderfolgende Abfragen derselben Seite identische Antworten ergeben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Falls die Seiten aus einer Datenbank dynamisch erzeugt werden, kann sich der Datenbestand des Webservers durch die Updates der Datenbank ständig aendern. Dies ist zum Beispiel der Fall bei Katalogsystemen fuer Onlinehandel (Preis- und Produktupdates, Änderungen im Lagerbestand mit Auswirkungen auf die Lieferbarkeit usw.), bei Nachrichtenagenturen mit Anschluß an Presse- und Tickerdienste und bei Webverzeichnissen und Suchmaschinen, die einen Volltextindex für Seiten generieren und eine Recherche nach Inhalten erlauben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grundsätzlich ist der Datenbestand im Web als höchst dynamisch anzusehen: Neue Versionen von Seiten lassen sich zu sehr geringen Kosten erzeugen und in Verkehr bringen. Der elektronische Charakter des Mediums im Zusammenhang mit der zentralen Datenhaltung (es sind keine verteilten Kopien einer Seite auf Stand zu bringen) begünstigen weiterhin eine sehr hohe Auflagenfrequenz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;USENET News:&lt;/strong&gt; Das USENET ist ein verteiltes System vom Diskussionsforen (&lt;em&gt;Newsgroups&lt;/em&gt;). Es handelt sich um ein teilweise zusammenhängendes Netz von Servern, von denen jeder eine Auswahl von Artikeln zum Abruf bereithält. Die Artikel sind in der Regel in thematisch gegliederten Diskussionsforen in der Reihenfolge des Eingangs abgelegt. Leser können eine Verbindung zum netztopologisch am günstigsten gelegenen Server aufbauen und Artikel nach Diskussionsforen und Eingangsdatum selektiert abrufen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leser können grundsätzlich auf jeden gelesenen Artikel
antworten (&lt;em&gt;to follow up on an article&lt;/em&gt;) oder unabhängig
eigene Artikel auf dem Server ablegen (&lt;em&gt;posten&lt;/em&gt;, von engl. &lt;em&gt;to post a notice&lt;/em&gt;). Der Server wird dann seine Nachbarserver darüber informieren, daß er einen neuen Artikel vorrätig hat, und den Artikel ggf. an seine Nachbarserver replizieren (&lt;em&gt;to feed an article to a neighboring system&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diese verbreiten den Artikel dann wieder an ihre Nachbarn usw. (&lt;em&gt;flood fill algorithm of USENET&lt;/em&gt;). Nach einigen Stunden existieren Hunderttausende von Kopien dieses Artikels auf der gesamten Welt. Die Vernetzung der Server ist hochredundant; Unterbrechungen in Serverstrecken haben in der Regel keine oder nur lokal meßbare Auswirkungen auf Verfügbarkeit oder Transportgeschwindigkeit der Artikel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Um Platz zu gewinnen, werden die jeweils ältesten Artikel nach einiger Zeit gelöscht. Die genaue Zeitspanne bis zur Löschung hängt von der  individuellen Konfiguration des Servers und seiner Platzsituation ab, liegt aber in der Regel nicht über 14 Tagen. Es existieren jedoch auch einige Newsarchive, die Diskussionen über mehrere Jahre hinweg abspeichern und diesen Datenbestand durch weitgehende Recherchemöglichkeiten erschliessen (z.B.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dejanews.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;DejaNews&lt;/a&gt;

, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.altavista.digital.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;AltaVista&lt;/a&gt;

 im Newsmodus).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dadurch, daß jeder Leser auf beliebige Artikel direkt und ohne redaktionelle Bearbeitung antworten kann, entspinnen sich in der Regel unmoderierte, öffentliche Diskussionen zu allen möglichen Themen. Ein Großteil der Diskussionsforen wird global ausgetauscht. Daher ist die Zusammensetzung der Diskussionsrunden zufällig und international.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Kommunikation zwischen Leser und Server sowie die Kommunikation zwischen den Servern erfolgt in der Regel unverschlüsselt und ohne Identifizierung und Authentisierung der Leser oder der Autoren von Artikeln. Die Fälschung von Absenderadresse oder Herkunftspfad eines Artikels ist trivial und in einigen Diskussionsforen sogar üblich. Es existieren Konverter von E-Mail nach USENET News und Anonymous- sowie Pseudonymous-Server, die zum Teil mit kryptographisch starken Methoden die Identität des Absenders sowie seinen Aufenthaltsort im Netz zu verschleiern suchen. Einige Newsserver lassen Lese- und Schreibzugriff von jedermann und ohne Authentisierung zu (&lt;em&gt;open servers&lt;/em&gt;); es ist Sache des Veröffentlichenden, seine Identität in einem Artikel offenzulegen oder nicht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Entscheidung über die von einem Server angebotenen Diskussionsforen obliegt in der Regel jedem einzelnen Serverbetreiber. Teilweise existieren Kataloge von offiziellen Newsgroups, diese sind jedoch in der Regel weder vollständig noch für irgendwen verbindlich. Name oder überschrift einer Newsgroup haben nur den Charakter von Empfehlungen. Thematisch falsch eingeordnete Artikel (&lt;em&gt;off topic postings&lt;/em&gt;) oder bewußt massenhaft in alle Newsgroups verbreitete Artikel (&lt;em&gt;spam&lt;/em&gt;) machen einen festen Anteil aller Artikel aus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Dienste &lt;strong&gt;IRC&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;Internet Relay Chat&lt;/strong&gt;) und &lt;em&gt;E-Mail&lt;/em&gt; (Private elektronische Post sowie halböffentliche Mailinglists als Diskussionsforen) wären ebenfalls zu betrachten, sollen hier aber im Interesse einer kompakten Darstellung nicht diskutiert werden, da sie weniger im Rampenlicht der öffentlichen Diskussion stehen. Die genannten Argumente gelten aber in ähnlicher Form auch dort. Es existieren weitere Dienste, die fuer die öffentliche Kommunikation in der Regel von geringerer Bedeutung sind (&lt;em&gt;telnet&lt;/em&gt;) oder deren Diskussion keine neuen Aspekte zu Tage foerdern wuerde (&lt;em&gt;ftp&lt;/em&gt;, siehe &lt;em&gt;http&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wie-koennen-zu-sperrende-inhalte-identifiziert-werden&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#wie-koennen-zu-sperrende-inhalte-identifiziert-werden&#34;&gt;
	Wie koennen zu sperrende Inhalte identifiziert werden?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Um Inhalte zuverlässig sperren zu können, ist es notwendig, diese Inhalte in irgendeiner Form zu identifizieren. Diese Identifizierung kann von unterschiedlicher Auflösung sein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auf der Basis von IP-Adressen kann ein einzelner Rechner identifiziert werden. Ein solcher Rechner erbringt jedoch in der Regel eine Vielzahl von Diensten für mehrere unterschiedliche Anbieter. Webserver von IP-Providern bringen unter einer IP-Adresse teilweise die Angebote von Tausenden Inhaltsanbietern ins Netz, Rechner von Kleinprovidern bieten teilweise alle Dienste des Providers unter einer IP-Nummer an. Eine Sperrung von IP-Nummern trifft also außer den zu sperrenden Inhalten meist auch eine große Menge von Inhalten und Diensten, deren Sperrung nicht beabsichtigt ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mit entsprechendem Mehraufwand können dienstspezifische Kennzeichen von einzelnen Einheiten des Angebotes identifiziert werden. Im World Wide Web ist dies der Name einer Seite (ihr &lt;em&gt;Universal Resource Locator&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;URL&lt;/em&gt;), in den USENET News erfolgt die Identifizierung über die Message-ID einer einzelnen Nachricht oder den Namen einer Newsgroup. Für neu entstehende Dienste müssen dienstspezifische Methoden zur Identifikation einzelner Einheiten neu gefunden werden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die zu bewertenden Datenmengen sind riesig: Die Suchmaschine &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.altavista.digital.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Altavista&lt;/a&gt;

 hatte im Mai
1996 schon 30 Millionen Webseiten in ihrer Volltextdatenbank
gespeichert; im April 1997 betrug das Newsaufkommen mehr als 72
Gigabyte für etwa 5,4 Millionen Artikel (Statistik von Eunet
Deutschland GmbH aus &lt;a href=&#34;news:de.admin.lists&#34;&gt;de.admin.lists&lt;/a&gt;

 vom 01.05.97).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es bleibt das Problem, zu sperrende Inhalte aus der Menge aller Inhalte zu isolieren. Hier gibt es nur zwei grundsätzlich verschiedene Systeme:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Die automatische Bewertung von Inhalten auf der Basis formaler Merkmale wie etwa dem Vorhandensein bestimmter Schlüsselworte.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Die manuelle Bewertung von Inhalten durch den Anbieter oder Dritte nach bestimmten Kriterienkatalogen (&lt;em&gt;rating&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verfahren zur automatischen Bewertung von Inhalten aufgrund von Schlüsselworten scheitern bei Komponenten, die keinen Text enthalten (Audiodateien, Bilder oder Animationen) schon im Ansatz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Einige Online-Dienste (Prodigy, AOL) haben versucht, Diskussionen in dem IRC-Dienst ähnlichen Chaträumen aufgrund des Gebrauchs bestimmter Schlüsselworte bewerten zu lassen; die Ergebnisse waren wenig befriedigend. Einerseits waren normale Diskussionen über bestimmte Themen nicht mehr möglich:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eine Sperrung des Wortes &lt;em&gt;suck&lt;/em&gt; erschwerte den Meinungsaustausch zu Staubsaugern in einem Haushaltsforum, eine Sperrung des Wortes &lt;em&gt;breast&lt;/em&gt; behinderte Diskussionen über Brustkrebs oder Kochrezepte (Hühnerbrust), und die Webseiten von Frau Cindy Tittle Moore (&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:tittle@netcom.com&#34;&gt;tittle@netcom.com&lt;/a&gt;

) wurden durch das Programm Cybersitter wegen ihres Namens gesperrt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andererseits veränderte die eigentliche Zielgruppe einfach ihr Vokabular, so daß die Sperrung auf diese Zielgruppe keine nennenswerte Auswirkung hatte. Auch andere automatisierbare Bewertungsmethoden vermögen nicht die Semantik der Inhalte zu erkennen. Wer solche formalen Sperrkriterien kennt, kann leicht die Darstellung seiner Informationen je nach Bedarf an diese Kriterien anpassen, ohne die inhaltliche Aussage zu verändern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das Kindersicherungsprogramm Cybersitter ist beispielsweise in der
Lage, als offensive eingestufte Worte aus Webseiten
herauszuschneiden. Durch geschickte Formulierung sind so Aussagen in ihr Gegenteil verkehrbar, wenn sie unter Cybersitter betrachtet werden (Nachricht von Bennett Haselton auf der Mailingliste
&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:fight-censorship@vorlon.mit.edu&#34;&gt;fight-censorship@vorlon.mit.edu&lt;/a&gt;

, Message-ID: &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:01IAZF6R8I0I8XKGCV@ctrvax.Vanderbilt.Edu&#34;&gt;01IAZF6R8I0I8XKGCV@ctrvax.Vanderbilt.Edu&lt;/a&gt;

).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verfahren und Standards zur Bewertung von Inhalten durch den Anbieter oder Dritte liegen für den Bereich des World Wide Web bereits vor, das System &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/PICS/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;PICS&lt;/a&gt;

 (Platform for Internet Content Selection) ist dabei zur Zeit führend. PICS erlaubt die Installation frei definierbarer Bewertungsmaßstäbe mit einer beliebig feinen Auflösung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bewertungen von URLs koennen von den Anbietern selbst oder durch Dritte erfolgen. Gängige Bewertungsmaßstäbe sind dabei etwa Gewalt, Sex oder unanständige Sprache, die Abstufungen reichen von digitalen 0-1-Skalen bis zu sehr fein abgestuften Systemen. Die Auswertung von PICS-Einstufungen kann entweder im Clientprogramm des Anwenders erfolgen (dies wird zur Zeit vom Microsoft Internet Explorer unterstützt) oder auf Routern auf dem Weg zum Empfänger (dies geschieht zur Zeit nicht).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das Hauptproblem bei der manuellen Bewertung von Inhalten ist die große Menge der anfallenden neuen oder veränderten Seiten. Der Betreiber des Nachrichtenservers &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.msnbc.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;www.msnbc.com&lt;/a&gt;

 (Joint-Venture von NBC und Microsoft) hat die Bewertung seiner Beiträge auf der Basis des von Microsoft geförderten Bewertungsschemas RSACi für PICS eingestellt, da die Bewertung einzelner Beiträge zu aufwendig war und eine Pauschalbewertung des Servers nach den Regeln von PICS den Server fuer Minderjährige unzugänglich gemacht haette (Briefwechsel zwischen Irene Graham, Michael Sims, Stephen Balkam (RSAC Ratingaufsicht) und Danielle Bachelder (MSNBC Systembetrieb), zitiert in &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:3339dd1a.500215@mail.thehub.com.au&#34;&gt;3339dd1a.500215@mail.thehub.com.au&lt;/a&gt;

 und &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:199703191314.IAA03203@arutam.inch.com&#34;&gt;199703191314.IAA03203@arutam.inch.com&lt;/a&gt;

 auf derselben
Mailingliste).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hinzu kommt, dass die Webseite abhängig vom Kontext des Abrufes  unterschiedlich aussehen kann, so daß eine Bewertung nach dem PICS-System problematisch wäre. Gerade diejenigen Seiten, die die interaktive Komponente des Internet ausnutzen, könnten so wegen ihrer dynamischen Generierung aus der Bewertung herausfallen und würden damit in entsprechend konfigurierten Browsern und Suchmaschinen nicht mehr dargestellt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Bewertung von Angeboten erfolgt im Rahmen von PICS derzeit durch private Organisationen. Die Möglichkeiten des Widerspruchs gegen eine bestimmte Einstufung sind dabei begrenzt. Insbesondere ist es für einen Bürger schwierig, ein korrektes Rating einzufordern, wenn die Ratingorganisation in einem fremden Land sitzt. Im Prinzip liegt hier dasselbe Problem vor, das sich zur Zeit bei der Strafverfolgung ausländischer illegaler Angebote stellt, nur daß die Ressourcen und Beweislasten nun andersherum verteilt sind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein Anbieter muß nun bei falscher Einstufung beweisen, dass sein Angebot legal ist, und er muß dazu den schwierigen Weg der Durchsetzung von Ansprüchen im Ausland gehen. Im Vergleich zu einer Staatsanwaltschaft ist ein Anbieter von Webseiten dafür im Durchschnitt schlechter ausgebildet,  und ihm stehen weniger Ressourcen zur Verfügung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weiterhin orientieren sich die Ratingorganisationen an Werten und kulturellen Maßstäben ihrer Nation. Die übernahme ausländischer Bewertungen für deutsche Benutzer ist daher problematisch. Da jedoch keine deutsche Zugriffssoftware existiert, werden meist nur ausländische (speziell US-amerikanische) Ratingsysteme unterstützt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die meisten Ratingorganisationen dokumentieren ihre Ratings nicht oder nur sehr ungern. Zum Teil erfolgt noch nicht einmal eine Benachrichtigung des Bewerteten über die Bewertung seines Angebotes. Vollständige Verzeichnisse aller vergebenen Ratings werden meist mit der Begründung unter Verschluss gehalten, daß diese Verzeichnisse als Kataloge fuer Schmutz und Schund mißbraucht werden könnten. Bei den Programmen, die die Bewertungen von Webseiten Dritter nicht online beziehen, sondern als Datei auf der lokalen Festplatte installiert haben, ist diese Liste grundsätzlich verschlüsselt - und meistens auch veraltet. Auch gegenüber dem Benutzer solcher Software ist damit nicht offengelegt, welche Angebote ihm nicht mehr zugänglich sind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inzwischen existieren (illegal) entschlüsselte Versionen der Sperrlisten aller Hersteller von Programmen mit statischer, in Dateien gelieferter Sperrliste. Die Auswertung der Sperrungen hat bei allen Herstellern eine klare politische Agenda und persönliche Feindschaften dokumentiert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beispielsweise wurden vielfach Angebote von &lt;em&gt;womens organizations&lt;/em&gt;, Informationsangebote über Abtreibung und Angebote schwuler und lesbischer Gruppen zensiert. Es ist weiterhin üblich, Webseiten in die Sperrlisten aufzunehmen, die den Hersteller des Sperrprogramms kritisieren, die Sperrliste offenlegen oder allgemein gegen Rating argumentieren. Beim Hersteller des Programms Cybersitter geht dies so weit, daß bei installiertem Cybersitter alle Seiten nicht mehr abrufbar sind, in denen die Namen von Kritikern seines Programms erwähnt werden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mit-welchen-mitteln-kann-eine-sperrung-erreicht-werden&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#mit-welchen-mitteln-kann-eine-sperrung-erreicht-werden&#34;&gt;
	Mit welchen Mitteln kann eine Sperrung erreicht werden?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sperrungen können auf unterschiedlichen Ebenen der Kommunikation ansetzen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Um erfolgreich zu kommunizieren, müssen beide Kommunikationspartner eine physikalische Verbindung zueinander aufbauen. Dies kann eine Standleitung, eine Telefonleitung, eine Richtfunkstrecke oder eine andere Kommunikationsform sein. Eine normalerweise nicht praktikable Möglichkeit der Sperrung besteht darin, diese physikalische Kommunikation zu verhindern, indem man etwa einen Telefonanschluss sperrt oder bestimmte Telefonnummern nicht erreichbar schaltet, Standleitungen unterbricht oder Störsender in Richtfunkstrecken einbringt. Das Opfer der Sperrung verliert damit in der Regel alle seine Kommunikationsmöglichkeiten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Im Internet wird meist keine homogene physikalische Verbindung verwendet, sondern diese Verbindung wird aus Teilstücken unterschiedlicher Technologie zusammengestückelt. An den übergangspunkten zwischen den Teilstücken befindet sich ein Router, der IP-Pakete von einem Teilstück zum nächsten hinueberhievt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Funktionalität des Routers wird dabei von den Adressen in den einzelnen IP-Paketen und seinen Routingtabellen gesteuert. In den Routingtabellen ist eingetragen, in welche Richtung der Router Pakete mit einer gegebenen Zieladresse weiterzuleiten hat. Die klassische Dienstleistung eines Providers besteht darin, einen übergang zwischen einer Wählverbindung (Privatkunden) oder einer regionalen Standleitung (Firmenkunden) und einer oder mehreren Standleitungen in das Ausland zu bieten. Dem Provider ist dabei nicht bekannt, welche Dienste der Kunde in Anspruch nimmt oder welche Daten abgerufen werden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sperrungen können hier über Eingriffe in die Routingtabellen von Routern vorgenommen werden. Es ist beispielsweise leicht möglich, alle Pakete an bestimmte Zieladressen am Router verwerfen zu lassen (eine Route zu &lt;em&gt;erden&lt;/em&gt;). Mit diesem Verfahren werden ganze Rechner unerreichbar: Bei der durch den DFN-Verein praktizierten Sperrung des Rechners mit dem Namen &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xs4all.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;www.xs4all.com&lt;/a&gt;

 waren auf diese Weise die Webseiten von mehr als 6000 Anbietern nicht mehr abrufbar, es konnte keine Mail auf der Maschine &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xs4all.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;www.xs4all.com&lt;/a&gt;

 eingeliefert werden, und auch alle andere Kommunikation des DFN-Vereins mit dieser Maschine wurde unterbunden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Auswahl eines Dienstes erfolgt im TCP/IP-Protokoll in der Regel durch die Angabe einer TCP-Portnummer. Mit Hilfe dieser Portnummer könnte eine selektivere Sperrung eines Dienstes erfolgen. Beispielsweise sind einige Router in der Lage, nach entsprechender Konfiguration TCP-Verkehr fuer den Port 80 (HTTP) zu einer Zieladresse zu sperren, Verkehr auf Port 25 (Mail) zu derselben Adresse aber zu gestatten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mit Hilfe eines Vermittlungsrechners (&lt;em&gt;proxy&lt;/em&gt;) oder anderer Firewallsoftware, denen die im Netzmodell höher liegenden Ebenen zugänglich sind, kann eine selektive Sperrung auf der Ebene von Dienstelementen (einzelnen Seiten, einzelnen Nachrichten) erreicht werden. Die Firewallsoftware muß herbei jedoch fuer jeden Dienst (WWW, News, Mail, IRC etc.) angepaßt werden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solche Systeme sind in der Regel sehr aufwendig im Betrieb, da sie für die nutzenden Clients die volle Leistung aller durch den Client in Anspruch genommenen Dienste simulieren müssen. Mit steigender Zahl von Clients skalieren sich diese Systeme ausgesprochen schlecht. Trotzdem setzen einige totalitäre Staaten auf dieses System, um das Eindringen mißliebiger Inhalte in das Land zu erschweren: In China, Singapur und in den Golfstaaten läuft sämtliche Kommunikation mit dem Ausland durch staatlich betriebene Firewalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sperrung von IP-Adressen und der Einsatz von Firewalls ist unter bestimmten Voraussetzungen kombinierbar, dadurch ist eine Entlastung der  Firewallmaschine möglich: Anstatt die Route zu einer zu sperrenden Maschine zu erden, läßt man alle Routen zur zu sperrenden Maschine auf einen Firewall zeigen, der dann die Dienste der zu sperrenden Maschine überwacht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diese Lösung ist je nach Art der zu sperrenden und zu simulierenden Dienste sehr aufwendig zu konfigurieren und zu warten. Zum einen setzt sie einen zentralen übergangspunkt zwischen dem zu kontrollierenden deutschen Netz und dem Rest der Welt voraus. Zum anderen handelt es sich bei diesem Verfahren um einen klassischen &lt;em&gt;Man in the middle&lt;/em&gt; Angriff. Dadurch versagt das Verfahren bei aller stark verschlüsselten Kommunikation, die  unempfindlich gegen solche Angriffe ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grundsätzlich sind die Auswirkungen von Filtermechanismen auf die Systemleistung um so höher, je feiner die Granularität der Sperrungen ist und je größer die Liste der zu sperrenden Informationsquellen ist. Systeme wie PICS lassen sich nicht effizient an zentralen Stellen im Netz etablieren, sondern können nur dezentral funktionieren. Alle bisher diskutierten Verfahren der Sperrung setzen auf dritten Maschinen zwischen dem Anbieter der zu sperrenden Information und dem Abrufer an. Denkbar wäre auch eine Sperrung beim Anbieter der Information sowie eine Sperrung beim Abrufer. Dies setzt jedoch eine Kooperation des Anbieters bzw. Abrufers voraus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eine Sperrung beim Anbieter würde bedeuten, daß der Anbieter die zu sperrenden Inhalte entweder niemandem anbietet oder daß er sie nur bestimmten Personen nicht anbietet. Ein personenselektives Anbieten von Inhalten setzt selbst bei Kooperation des Anbieters voraus, daß der Anbieter den Abrufer einer Information zweifelsfrei identifizieren kann und daß ihm genaue und juristisch hieb- und stichfeste Entscheidungstabellen vorgelegt werden, die es ihm erlauben, automatisch zu entscheiden, wem er welche Inhalte ausliefern darf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein Identifikationsmechanismus, der das Geforderte leistet, existiert derzeit nicht einmal im Ansatz und ist auch nicht in absehbarer Zeit realisierbar. Insbesondere kann nicht aus der IP-Adresse oder dem Rechnernamen eines Absenders auf seine Identität oder seinen physikalischen Aufenthalt geschlossen werden: Deutsche Kunden von amerikanischen Online-Diensten erscheinen im Netz als aus den Vereinigten Staaten kommend. Ähnliches gilt für Mitarbeiter multinationaler Konzerne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eine Sperrung beim Abrufer würde bedeuten, daß die angebotenen Inhalte nach bestimmten Bewertungskriterien ausgezeichnet sind (&lt;em&gt;rating&lt;/em&gt;, z.B. nach PICS) und daß der Abrufer selbst seine Software so konfiguriert, daß Seiten mit bestimmten Ratings nicht mehr abgerufen werden können. Eine Kooperation des Anbieters wäre hier wünschenswert, ist aber nicht notwendig, da die Bewertungen auch von Servern Dritter geliefert werden können.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#auf-welche-weise-koennen-sperrungen-unterlaufen-werden&#34;&gt;
	Auf welche Weise koennen Sperrungen unterlaufen werden?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Für den Nutzer stellt sich eine Sperrung von Inhalten als Betriebsstörung dar. Er wird nach Wegen suchen, die ordnungsgemäße Funktion des Netzes wiederherzustellen, d.h. die Sperrung zu unterlaufen. Diese Motivation ist um so größer, je stärker sich der Benutzer durch die Sperrung behindert fühlt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bei einer Sperrung der physikalischen Kommunikation ist dies nur durch einen Wechsel des Mediums möglich: Wenn etwa ein Störsender in Betrieb genommen wird, wird man versuchen, auf das Telefonnetz auszuweichen und umgekehrt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bei einer Sperrung von bestimmten IP-Adressen stehen dem Benutzer mehrere Möglichkeiten offen, die Störung zu umgehen. Alle laufen darauf hinaus, den sperrenden Router vollständig zu umgehen (siehe auch &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fitug.de/ulf/zensur/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ulf Moeller&lt;/a&gt;

, Internet-Zensur:
Routingsperren umgehen):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Benutzer wechselt den Internet-Anbieter, notfalls wird er Kunde bei einem ausländischen Provider. Er baut eine Telefonverbindung oder Standleitung zu diesem Provider auf und wickelt seine Kommunikation über diesen nichtsperrenden Provider ab. Der sperrende Router des lokalen Providers wird nicht mehr verwendet, die Sperre ist wirkungslos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diese Situation tritt automatisch ein, wenn der Nutzer Mitarbeiter eines (multinationalen) Konzerns mit einem eigenen Konzernverbundnetz ist, das an mehreren Stellen (im Ausland) mit dem Internet verbunden ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Benutzer wird Kunde bei einem zweiten, nichtsperrenden Internet-Anbieter, notfalls im Ausland. Er baut eine TCP/IP-Verbindung zu diesem Provider auf und läßt seine Anwendungen auf dem entfernten Rechner, ggf. im Ausland, ablaufen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es gibt inzwischen eine Reihe von Providern, die solche Angebote
routinemäßig anbieten. Die Palette reicht dabei von der
Bereitstellung einzelner Dienste (Postboxen fuer E-Mail (z.B. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pobox.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;pobox.com&lt;/a&gt;

), Webservices (z.B. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.geocities.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;geocities.com&lt;/a&gt;

) usw.) bis zu kompletten Exil-Logins (z.B. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.c2.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;c2.org&lt;/a&gt;

, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.acm.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;acm.org&lt;/a&gt;

, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xs4all.nl/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;xs4all.nl&lt;/a&gt;

).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der sperrende Router des lokalen Providers sieht keine Kommunikation mit einer gesperrten Adresse, sondern nur Kommunikation mit dem entfernten Provider. Die Zugriffe auf die gesperrten Adressen erfolgen von dort, also erst hinter dem sperrenden Router. Die Sperre durch den Router wird wirkungslos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Benutzer wird Kunde bei einem zweiten, nichtsperrenden Internet-Anbieter, notfalls im Ausland. Er baut eine Mobile-IP-Verbindung zu diesem Provider auf, d.h. seine IP-Pakete werden in anderen IP-Paketen verpackt zum zweiten Internet-Anbieter geschickt, dort ausgepackt und eingespielt. Optional kann die Kommunikation zum zweiten Provider verschlüsselt erfolgen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Linux müssen dazu die folgenden beiden Kommandos gegeben
werden:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktivierung des Interface &lt;code&gt;tunl0&lt;/code&gt; zum entfernten
Anbieter &lt;code&gt;myriad.ml.org&lt;/code&gt;: `ifconfig tunl0 (your.ip.address) pointopoint
myriad.ml.org&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legen einer Route zu &lt;code&gt;www.xs4all.nl&lt;/code&gt; über &lt;code&gt;tunl0&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;route add www.xs4all.nl tunl0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Für einen Beobachter erscheint der Nutzer als normaler Kunde des zweiten IP-Providers. Der sperrende Router des lokalen Providers sieht nur eine Verbindung zum entfernten zweiten Provider. Die Sperre ist wirkungslos. Mobile-IP ist ein Routineangebot fuer IP-Provider, die Geschäftskunden betreuen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Anbieter der gesperrten Information kann Abrufer unterstützen, indem er ebenfalls versucht, die Sperre zu unterlaufen. Im Falle der Sperrung des Rechners &lt;code&gt;www.xs4all.nl&lt;/code&gt; hat der gesperrte Anbieter die Internet-Adresse seines Rechners alle paar Minuten verändert. Sperrungen einer einzelnen Adresse wurden dadurch wirkungslos, statt dessen mußten ganze Teilnetze gesperrt werden (die Sperrung wurde noch unspezifischer, es wurden als Nebenwirkung noch mehr unbeteiligte Anbieter mitgesperrt).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Während die bisher diskutierten Möglichkeiten des Unterlaufens von Sperrungen unabhängig vom gesperrten Dienst waren, sind die folgenden Moeglichkeiten dienstspezifisch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;www&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#www&#34;&gt;
	WWW&amp;lt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ähnlich der erwähnten Veränderung der IP-Nummer eines Serverrechners kann  auch die Adresse eines Angebotes auf einem Server automatisch verändert werden. Eine automatische Sperrung einzelner Angebote würde dadurch unterlaufen werden, und man müßte wieder den gesamten Rechner pauschal sperren. Dort greifen dann wieder die Methoden zum Unterlaufen einer Komplettsperrung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn zu einem Angebot eine Suchmaschine existiert, mit der alle Seiten eines Angebotes nach bestimmten Begriffen durchsucht werden können, ist eine einzelne Seite praktisch unter beliebig vielen Adressen zu bekommen (nämlich allen Begriffen, die den Text in der Suchmaschine finden). Eine Sperrung müßte hier zusätzlich den Zugriff auf die Suchmaschine verhindern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das Verfahren des indirekten Zugriffs, wie es unter Mobile-IP diskutiert wurde, läßt sich mit Veränderungen auch für WWW einsetzen: Mit Hilfe eines entfernten Webservers, der Zugriffe im Auftrag Dritter abwickelt (&lt;em&gt;Proxy-Server&lt;/em&gt;), ist ein indirekter Abruf der Seite möglich. Da Proxy-Server mit Zwischenspeicher zur Beschleunigung von Zugriffen üblich sind, ist es in der Regel kein Problem, einen solchen dritten Server zu finden. Im Rahmen der Zensurdiskussion der letzten Monate sind mittlerweile im In- und Ausland auch schon Proxy-Server für solche Umgehungen explizit eingerichtet worden (etwa am MIT fuer chinesische Staatsbürger, die die Zensur im eigenen Land unterlaufen möchten).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bei verschlüsselter Kommunikation (etwa mit dem in allen gängigen Browsern eingebauten SSL-Support) entsteht ein nicht mehr in Echtzeit einsehbarer und nicht einfach verfälschbarer Kanal zwischen Server und Client. Für Dritte ist nicht erkennbar, welche Seiten abgerufen werden und welche Informationen sie enthalten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;news&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#news&#34;&gt;
	News
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artikel in den USENET News liegen in zahlreichen Kopien auf Tausenden von Servern überall auf der Welt vor. Löschungen (&lt;em&gt;Cancel&lt;/em&gt;) werden von vielen dieser Server nicht mehr ausgeführt, nachdem es seit einigen Jahren immer wieder zu gefälschten Löschaufforderungen von Saboteuren kam. Die großen Archive fuer USENET News (DejaNews und AltaVista) führen grundsätzlich keine Löschungen aus. Über Archivanfragen ist es daher in der Regel möglich, auch auf ältere und lokal nicht mehr verfügbare Texte zuzugreifen. Dabei gilt wie bei Suchmaschinen für Webseiten (siehe oben): Artikel sind nicht nur unter einer festen Bezeichnung abrufbar, sondern werden auch zu beliebigen im Artikel enthaltenen Stichworten gefunden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Im Rahmen einer Untersuchung der bayrischen Staatsanwaltschaft wurde der Betreiber Compuserve aufgefordert, einige Newsgroups grundsätzlich nicht mehr bereitzustellen, da bei ihnen davon auszugehen sei, dass diese in Deutschland strafrechtlich relevante Inhalte enthielten. Die Leser dieser Gruppen beziehen diese jetzt direkt von anderen, nicht gesperrten Newsservern. Ausserdem gehen die Autoren von Artikeln für solche schlecht verbreiteten Newsgroups immer mehr dazu über, ihre Artikel zusätzlich in andere, thematisch unpassende, aber besser verbreitete Gruppen zu setzen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So kam es zum Beispiel anläßlich der Sperrung des Servers &lt;code&gt;www.xs4all.nl&lt;/code&gt; wegen des Angebotes der verbotenen Zeitschrift Radikal, Ausgabe 154 zweimal zu je einem Posting der Komplettausgabe der Radikal in den Diskussionsforen de.soc.zensur (Diskussion über Zensur und Inhaltskontrolle) und
de.org.politik.spd (Forum des virtuellen Ortsverbandes der SPD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Da die Neueinrichtung von Newsgroups technisch automatisiert werden kann, kommt es vielfach zur Neueinrichtung schlecht verbreiteter Gruppen unter neuem Namen oder zum Angebot bekannter Gruppen unter Aliasnamen. So wurde die Gruppe de.talk.sex (Diskussionsforum über Sexualität) an einer deutschen Universität mehrere Jahre lang unter dem Namen de.soc.verkehr geführt, nachdem dort entschieden worden war, keine Gruppen mehr anzubieten, deren Bezeichnung den Begriff sex enthält.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#andere-effekte-von-sperrungsversuchen&#34;&gt;
	Andere Effekte von Sperrungsversuchen
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jede Sperre kann unterlaufen werden, indem die gesperrte Information vielfach repliziert wird. Dann ist jedes Vorkommen dieser Information gesondert zu sperren. Dadurch werden die unangenehmen Nebenwirkungen der Sperrung vervielfacht, bis die Kosten fuer die Sperrung ihren Nutzen übersteigen. Im Falle der Sperrung von &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xs4all.nl&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;www.xs4all.nl&lt;/a&gt;

 wegen des Angebotes der verbotenen Radikal 154 existierten innerhalb kürzester Zeit über 40 Kopien der gesperrten Information. Die 6000 aus technischen Gründen mitgesperrten Anbieter wurden jedoch nicht repliziert. Bezüglich der angestrebten Wirkung wurde also eher das Gegenteil erreicht, während viele Anbieter durch die unbeabsichtigten Nebenwirkungen Verluste hinnehmen mußten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mit Hilfe der USENET News ist diese Replikation tausendfach automatisiert und mit minimalem Aufwand vorzunehmen. Aus diesem Grunde kam es nach der Sperrung von xs4all auch zu einer Verbreitung der Webseiten der Radikal in den News (die Webseiten der anderen 6000 Kunden von xs4all wurden nicht in die News eingespielt).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alle Kommunikation mit Hilfe des TCP/IP-Protokolls ist konstruktionsbedingt eine individuelle Ende-zu-Ende-Kommunikation zwischen zwei Partnern. Selbst bei Betrachtung des Dienstes ist nicht erkennbar, ob die abgerufenen Informationen privater Natur sind (es ist möglich und für viele Anwender auch notwendig, ihre persönliche Post per WWW zu lesen) oder ob es sich um öffentliche Information handelt. Derartige Information kann sogar gemischt auf einer Webseite auftreten. Es ist zweifelhaft, inwieweit eine Kontrolle solcher Verbindungen durch unspezifisches Abhören (ohne richterlichen Beschluß) gestattet ist, selbst wenn dieses Abhören durch einen Roboter geschieht, der auf Schlüsselworte oder Ratings reagiert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicht nur vom Standpunkt der Kontrolle der Bewerter, sondern auch vom Standpunkt des technischen Netzbetriebes ist eine Offenlegung aller Sperrungen unbedingt notwendig. Wenn Sperrungen von Rechnern oder einzelnen Angeboten massenhaft umgesetzt werden, ist für den einzelnen Systembetreiber genau wie für den einzelnen Anwender nämlich nicht mehr entscheidbar, ob eine technische Störung vorliegt, die zu beheben ist, oder ob eine inhaltlich begründete Sperrung vorgenommen wurde. Damit wird einer zuverlässigen Fehleranalyse durch die Betreiber von Netzen oder einzelnen Maschinen jede Grundlage entzogen, da aus dem Vorliegen einer Störung keine sichere Verhaltensvorschrift zu ihrer Behebung abgeleitet werden kann. Andererseits können offengelegte Sperrlisten natuerlich leicht als Kataloge fuer sexuell explizite oder gewalttätige Angebote mißbraucht werden. Eine Sperrung wäre dann eine Art Qualitaetssiegel. Offengelegte Sperrungen sind mit entsprechend modifizierten Programmen außerdem automatisiert umgehbar.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#modifikation-des-internet&#34;&gt;
	Modifikation des Internet
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In dem heutigen Internet können Sperren nach den obigen Ausführungen also nicht oder nur mit unvertretbar hohen Kosten und Nebenwirkungen realisiert werden. Daraus ergibt sich die Frage, inwieweit das Internet modifiziert werden müßte, um effizientes Sperren von Inhalten zu erlauben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prinzipiell bieten Firewallsysteme (die von Unternehmen eingesetzt werden, um ihr Netz gegen unbefugtes Eindringen aus dem Internet zu schützen) einen Ansatz, effektive Sperren aufzubauen. Durch die Philosophie, nur solchen Daten das Passieren der Barriere zu gestatten, denen es explizit gestattet wurde, erzwingt man das Einhalten von Richtlinien.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ähnliche Richtlinien müßten fuer die Nutzung der Internet-Dienste durch die Benutzer aufgestellt und ihre Einhaltung erzwungen werden. Dies kann durch die Verwendung der Firewalltechnologie als Barriere zwischen den Anwendern und dem Internet oder durch die Verwendung proprietärer Protokolle erzwungen werden. Entscheidend ist, daß Teilnehmer im Netz ausschließlich identifizierbar agieren koennen, daß nur freigegebene Dienste, Protokolle und Datenformate verwendet werden, daß die Verwendung kryptographischer Verfahren verboten wird und daß sämtliche Aktivitäten protokolliert werden. Durch diese Massnahmen soll sichergestellt werden, daß der Benutzer einer Sperre nicht mehr ausweichen kann durch Wechsel der Identität, des Protokolls oder durch Verschleierung der Daten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unabhängig von der Frage, ob ein solches Verfahren mit einem demokratischen Rechtsstaat vereinbar wäre, gibt es auch wirtschaftliche und technische Gründe, die dagegen sprechen: Ein solches Netz wäre zentralistisch gesteuert und könnte nur unter großem Zeit- und Kostenaufwand an veränderte Anforderungen angepaßt werden. Sämtliche Online-Dienste haben dieses Modell auf Druck ihrer kommerziellen Benutzer aufgegeben. Der administrative Overhead einer solchen Lösung auf nationaler Ebene wäre gewaltig. Ausserdem wuerde jede Beschraenkung kryptographischer Verfahren eine Nutzung des Internet zur Übermittlung sensitiver Informationen beeinträchtigen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insgesamt könnte ein solches Modell katastrophale Standortnachteile mit sich bringen. Kommunikation ist eine Ressource, die in ihrer Bedeutung den Arbeitskräften oder der Verkehrsinfrastruktur in keiner Weise nachsteht. Auf der anderen Seite kann man, wie sich am Beispiel China zeigen läßt, selbst auf diese Art die Verbreitung unerwünschter Inhalte nur begrenzt unterbinden, denn für jede der oben genannten Massnahmen existieren wiederum Gegenmaßnahmen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bewertung&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#bewertung&#34;&gt;
	Bewertung
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eine zentrale Sperre von Inhalten im Internet läßt sich technisch nicht paßgenau vornehmen, ließe sich von den Benutzern bei Bedarf umgehen und wäre mit hohen Kosten verbunden (siehe auch Heimo Ponnath: &lt;a href=&#34;http://bda.netuse.de/bda/jp/home/heimo.ponnath/articles/SiN.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Pornographie im Internet&lt;/a&gt;

? Dichtung und Wahrheit, inside online 2/3 1996). Bedingt durch die globalen Datennetze zeigt sich hier der Paradigmenwechsel in den Aufgaben des Staates durch die Informationsgesellschaft, wie Alexander Rossnagel beschreibt (Alexander Rossnagel: Globale Datennetze: Ohnmacht des Staates - Selbstschutz der Buerger, ZRP 1997, Heft 1, 26-30). Die Ohnmachtserfahrung des Staates in der globalisierten Welt bedeutet jedoch nicht gleichzeitig eine Kapitulation vor den neuen Gefahren, sondern die modernen Informationstechnologien bergen vielfältige Möglichkeiten, daß der Bürger sich selbst schützen kann. Daraus erwächst die Verpflichtung für den Staat, Strukturen zu schaffen, die seine Bürger befähigen, ihre Interessen in der Welt der Netze selbstbestimmt zu schützen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hier bietet also die dezentrale Kontrolle und Filterung durch den Benutzer einen Lösungsansatz. Dazu müssen jedoch die Bewertungen durch Dritte (etwa nach dem PICS-System) transparent und nachvollziehbar sein. Beispielhafte Filterkonfigurationen können von einer Vielzahl von Interessengruppen vorgeschlagen werden; der Benutzer muß jedoch die Möglichkeit haben, seine eigene Konfiguration individuell vorzunehmen oder anzupassen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein universelles Rating wie PICS ist mit erhöhtem Zeitaufwand und zusätzlichen Kosten verbunden. Eine Reihe von Anbietern wird daher darauf verzichten. Den Ratingorganisationen kommt ein hohes Maß an Verantwortung zu, da jede Vorbewertung bereits zur Meinungsbildung der potentiellen Abrufer beiträgt und da absichtliche oder unabsichtliche Fehlbewertungen großen Schaden anrichten können. Geht es lediglich um die Gewährleistung eines Jugendschutzes im Internet, wäre es sehr viel billiger und unkritischer, wenn die Anbieter auf freiwilliger Basis ihre kindgerechten Materialien kennzeichneten und spezielle Kinderbrowser ähnlich dem TV-Kinderkanal nur solche Angebote darstellten (siehe &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thehub.com/~orene/liberty/label.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;he Net Labelling Delusion: Protection or Oppression&lt;/a&gt;

).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Erfahrungen in den USA zeigen, daß Organisationen das Instrument der Bewertung von Inhalten für die Durchsetzung ihrer eigenen politischen Ziele unter dem Deckmantel des Jugendschutzes oder der Aufrechterhaltung der öffentlichen Moral mißbrauchen. Es ist zu verhindern, daß die Definition moralischer und gesellschaftlicher Werte in den Aufgabenbereich privater Organisationen übertragen wird. Durch eine Offenlegung der Bewertungsmaßstäbe und aller Bewertungen kann diese Gefahr des Mißbrauchs reduziert werden.&lt;/p&gt;
