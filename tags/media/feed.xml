      <description>&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/isotopp/status/1450739310546886657&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;wrote on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;

 something about the term &amp;ldquo;Metaverse&amp;rdquo;.
That led to a contact with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/michacarl&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Michael Carl&lt;/a&gt;

, who wanted to make an episode for his &lt;a href=&#34;https://carls-zukunft.de/folge-58-how-to-build-a-metaversum-in-three-simple-steps/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Podcast&lt;/a&gt;

 with me.
My &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_OIl_bcrjVczLQrMrVnt5IoYbitp1504mb2GbQK0EM4/edit#heading=h.wbe6wnc7fg59&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;german notes and talk prep&lt;/a&gt;

 are now also available here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;metaverse&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#metaverse&#34;&gt;
	Metaverse
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;Metaverse&amp;rdquo; was initially coined by Neal Stephenson in 1992, but in the context of the current discussion it was defined as in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Metaverse: What It Is, Where to Find it, Who Will Build It, and Fortnite&lt;/a&gt;

 by Matthew Ball. Ball later &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.matthewball.vc/the-metaverse&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;wrote a lot more about the same&lt;/a&gt;

, and that led to the current Valley Hype around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are starting with games, who no longer are what they started out as, but somehow transcended:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fortnite by Epic Games, which now also hosts non-Fortnite events,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roblox, a platform to make and host low-end games, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minecraft in the Java and Bedrock editions, to show how both fail differently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fortnite&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#fortnite&#34;&gt;
	Fortnite
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortnite originally was a Battle Royale game, but is now also a platform that can host events. You can also buy skins for your characters or items, often in a partnership with other IP, for example Marvel/DC super heroes.
People gave concerts in there, or hosting other events.
Epic likes to do this, openly, because it establishes Fortnite with people who are not originally interested in Battle Royale or part of gaming culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epic Games also makes the Unreal Engine, and the associated pipelines for creating and editing in-game assets, hosts a market to sell these things, and is building a living infrastructure to produce games, and market them.
They are in a way the invisible back-cover of many games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;roblox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#roblox&#34;&gt;
	Roblox
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, but way more casual, Roblox operates a platform to create, host and market low-end games, &amp;ldquo;making games as a game&amp;rdquo;, and matching this, they also have assets, and an asset and game marketing outlet.
Roblox is mostly a thing with young and very young people, and vastly underrated with older people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;minecraft-in-two-flavors&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#minecraft-in-two-flavors&#34;&gt;
	Minecraft in two flavors
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minecraft is a classic: The original game is written in Java, and meanwhile completely replaceable with third party components. There are alternative clients, alternative servers, and alternative assets.
The game is bad: It is a sandbox without much story, an ill-defined goal and primitive graphics, the original servers are slow and buggy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the graphics are simple enough that even old potato computers can render it.
It is written in Java, which can be easily reversed and extended without cooperation from the vendor.
And thus there is an extremely rich community of modders, server and client plugins, and many other extensions.
As such, Minecraft is a gateway drug into Java programming with young people, because it has unlimited potential for self-motivation and initiates undirected and unprompted learning in many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of that leads to monetization that the current owner, Microsoft, can hook on.
As an IP asset, Minecraft Java is an utter failure, because after the initial purchase Microsoft is no longer part of the value chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why there is &amp;ldquo;Minecraft Bedrock Edition&amp;rdquo;, more performant, better designed and from the ground up with an asset marketplace.
You can buy Bedrock extensions in that marketplace, and only there.
As a maker of extensions, you will have to license IP from Microsoft, and pay percentages, as a customer anyway.
With gamers, it is not very popular, sterile, and without its own subculture.
Compared to the Java Edition, an even bigger failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bedrock model is comparable to the Apple Developer mode, but smaller in scope:
You can&amp;rsquo;t seriously develop for Apple machines without having an Apple-ID, a developer license, support for Apple Cloud for handover, and without leaving percentages to the Apple Store.
Bedrock copies that model, but not as a Computer-Tablet ecosystem, only as a game, and that did not take off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;metaverse-a-first-definition&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#metaverse-a-first-definition&#34;&gt;
	Metaverse: A first definition.
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition of &amp;ldquo;Metaverse&amp;rdquo; is hence less 3D goggles, and more &amp;ldquo;Integration of the gaming industry with the value chain of the entertainment industry for an open digital asset market&amp;rdquo;.
Or more open: siphoning off percentages along the gaming value chain during production, marketing and usage, and improving the value of gaming assets by partnering with entertainment properties and using their IP in gaming contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective is to get more lifetime consumer budget out of a person, without bothering them too much by investing actual time.
We want to extend the scope of &amp;ldquo;sellable media&amp;rdquo; in the widest sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;attention-and-time-budgets&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#attention-and-time-budgets&#34;&gt;
	Attention and time budgets
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have monetary limits, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_and_discretionary_income&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;the consumption part of disposable income&lt;/a&gt;

.
They also have time limits, an attention budget.
Both are convertible, but that is media dependent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming a useful lifetime of 60 years for media consumption, during that time I could read for example one book per week, for a total of 40 books per year.
In a total lifetime, that are 2400 books, at - say - 30 Euros each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With AAA games, one can do around 4-6 of them per year, 240-300 in a lifetime, at a value of around 60 Euros each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a total lifetime value of around 70k Euro in books, or 20k Euro in games per person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see that games are too cheap compared to their production cost, but a higher price than 60 Euro is unrealistic even for AAA titles.
That is one reason why each and every game has additional ways of spending money after purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general with both media types, there is a lot of my lifetime attention span bound for comparatively little money:
We need to up the burn rate.
Books, movies and especially AAA games are much too valuable per time and their consume binds too much attention for the business to scale up.
We need a different way to extract money that does not bind as many minutes of person-lifetime and attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is critically important, because there is also a lot of free content which competes for attention with our paid for assets, and which often is &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo; to bind time which we then cannot monetize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-sidebar-death-and-inheritances&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#a-sidebar-death-and-inheritances&#34;&gt;
	A sidebar: death and inheritances
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an aging population there is the sidebar &amp;ldquo;boomers die, their children inherit&amp;rdquo;.
For example, right now I have around 600 Steam titles, and around 1000 Kindle books.
When I die this represents multiple 10k Euro of value.
How can my son inherit this?
Politics has no answers, and the vendors say &amp;ldquo;he won&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rdquo;.
I can only leave my Steam login to my son, and crack the DRM of my Kindle titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economically, Kindle and Steam inheritances are largely irrelevant, or would be even be positive, and it is unclear why vendors are blocking this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I am inheriting a villa at the lake, I can go in, open the veranda, walk down through the park to the shore and enjoy the asset within minutes.
It does not take much time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inheriting my Kindle and Steam library, my son will need to invest a lot of time to enjoy that:
With 1200 books that will bind 30 years of lifetime,  and with an inheritance of 1000 games there will be titles from 2002 that look like drawn with crayons today.
I am inheriting &amp;ldquo;Skyrim&amp;rdquo;, but I will have to purchase the &amp;ldquo;VR&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Remastered&amp;rdquo; editions of that myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see immediately that this will hardly lead to a loss in revenue for vendors, in some cases it is more like a kind of advertisement, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;assets-high-budget-little-time&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#assets-high-budget-little-time&#34;&gt;
	Assets: high budget, little time
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even today, games offer loot boxes, pay-to-win and pay-to-skip purchases, and they sell cosmetics. Unlike the first three, the last one is hardly controversial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay-to-Win: to finish the game successfully you have to buy equipment with real money. Ideally this becomes apparent only of tou already are invested in the game emotionally and with lifetime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay-to-Skip: gameplay is often interrupted with annoying delays in which you can&amp;rsquo;t play, except you purchase immediate continuations with real money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lootboxes: The game sells containers with &amp;ldquo;random&amp;rdquo; in-game assets to you, some of which are very important in the context of the game. The actual game is just a wrapper for an addictive (and usually rigged) game of chance. The practice is already illegal as unregulated gambling in several EU countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to this, cosmetics are widely accepted: These are assets that change the way the character or their equipment looks like, without affecting gameplay. Also, virtual houses and house furnishings that have no effect on gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in &amp;ldquo;Elder Scrolls Online&amp;rdquo; as a player you can get easily and early in-game houses which are spectacularly located, and have a lot of empty space for decorations.
Furnishings to decorate the house can be gotten as trophies in-game, but every day things can only be gotten by using real money and purchase from the shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has many desirable properties for the vendor:
The player can spend a lot of money (without limits!) in-game, and hardly has to invest time or attention to make use of these assets.
We are no longer revenue-bound by the players&amp;rsquo; attention budget.
This is a much better thing to sell than books, films or the games themselves.
The game only provides context and reason for the cosmetics to exist, and defines their visuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epic-games&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#epic-games&#34;&gt;
	Epic Games
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is precisely the operating model of Epic Games:
With the Unreal Engine the company owns a platform for the fast and efficient design and rendering of really good-looking games.
This also includes the tooling for making in-game assets, but also a market to sell these to other game developers.
With the Epic Launcher and the integrated shop this is also a platform for game sales, and to collect meta and usage data for Epic, which again (for money) are sold back to the developer as analytics.
Epic operates a payment system, which pipes money from the customer to the developer, not only for games, but also for extensions, DLC and in-game purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Fortnite, Epic has their own game, which at the same time can also sell 3D assets to players as equipment, cosmetics and other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortnite is a special kind of game - player vs. player, battle royal - players play against each other and last man standing wins the round.
This kind of game is not interesting for all target demographics, but the engine of Fortnite is flexible and can be repurposed.
This enables other use-cases, among them also as a &amp;ldquo;virtual event platform&amp;rdquo;, which also keeps the interest up through media tie-ins and licensed IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interpretation of &amp;ldquo;The Metaverse&amp;rdquo; as a value chain for digital assets, specifically 3D assets, is too short-sighted:
As an ecosystem with a controlled number of large market operators and a very large numbers of content creators and customers the foundations will look better and have better longevity.
It is entirely possible to allow third parties to operate in this &amp;ldquo;virtual world&amp;rdquo;, trade with each other, especially if the market operators at all times get a tiny share from each transaction.
This is the idea of the &amp;ldquo;Microsoft tax&amp;rdquo;, revitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;players-in-this-market&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#players-in-this-market&#34;&gt;
	Players in this market
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different parties have different starting positions and strengths:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Epic Games/Fortnite - weak in IP, but some original IP, even if niche. Unreal Engine and other things on the &amp;ldquo;games invisible back-cover&amp;rdquo; as a big strength.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roblox - original IP, very young customers, grooms them into future customers, wait 10 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft - Minecraft, MS Store et al., too enterprise for success? But Halo, MSFS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple (sic!) - no IP, but platform/chain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disney (sic!) - only IP, but weak marketing outside of films/merchandise. Knows the game very well in the real world: Imagine Disneyland principles applied to a Metaverse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook - wants in at all costs, &amp;ldquo;pivot our enterprise&amp;rdquo;: If &amp;ldquo;social&amp;rdquo; of the future is &amp;ldquo;here&amp;rdquo;, we need to be &amp;ldquo;here&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google - all of this is a reason why Stadia still exists, despite being a flop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon - this is where the gaming strategy of Amazon is anchored. Amazon would like to be the AWS of the gaming world, instead of Epic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tech-maturity-cycle-and-standards&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#tech-maturity-cycle-and-standards&#34;&gt;
	Tech Maturity Cycle and standards
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Cynefin&lt;/a&gt;

 as a Market Maturity Model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are in the chaotic phase of market maturity:
Nobody has a business model for this.
It is unclear what the market will look like, what the standards are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the landgrab phase, building market share in a new and emerging market.
Interop is secondary, because the future standards are not yet visible.
Player try to differentiate themselves with features, also to find out which features matter.
All players grow in a growing market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as a business model and stable feature lists exists and there is a system for money extraction the market can consolidate.
As always, 3-5 companies will dominate the market, which is dropping out of hypergrowth.
The dominating companies acknowledge their respective existence and roles, and compete semi-cooperatively:
It is more important to erect barriers to entry for disruptors than to destroy the existing competition, and hence there will be complex, hard to implement standards with expensive compliance tests.
This will then, against all wishes, lead to interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;metaverse-revised-definition&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#metaverse-revised-definition&#34;&gt;
	Metaverse, revised definition
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we get:
The Metaverse is an integration of the gaming industry with the entertainment industry, and the merging of their value chains, optionally extracting a transactional tax at any point of the value chain.
The objective is to monetize the lifetime intellectual consumption budget of any person, and extending the market of products relevant to that person, decoupling spend from attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A main result is that books, films and games bind too much time to consume and limit spend.
3D assets are a better sale binding for less time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also the backdrop to read &amp;ldquo;Epic vs. Apple and Google&amp;rdquo; properly:
This is about opening the monopolistic markets these companies have for their hardware products, and allow other companies to monetize their walled gardens with their own offerings directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The german outlook is dreary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lacking highspeed, low latency infrastructure for gaming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lacking a German company with identity platforms (&amp;ldquo;Login with x&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lacking resources and companies with 3D asset tooling, production, marketplaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lacking German film/tv/literature IP that can be integrated with any of this, especially on a global scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;German companies and culture looks inward, into the own country, not towards a global cultural base.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare with Korea: Korean production chains in K-Pop; Korean &amp;ldquo;cultural technology&amp;rdquo; that integrated other cultures styles and art and integrates it into K-Pop; production and grooming pipelines for stars and starlets; emerging similar chains for IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison, Germany counts as unarmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;toxic-dystopic-interpretation&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#toxic-dystopic-interpretation&#34;&gt;
	Toxic-dystopic interpretation
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Property&amp;rdquo; in a simulated reality looks like property, but is virtual and can be duplicated easily.
Virtualization removes resource constraints in production, but &amp;ldquo;value&amp;rdquo; is only created by uniqueness in consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The platform operators and &amp;ldquo;tax&amp;rdquo; authorities have full market transparency and can meter the time spent and consumption habits of everybody.
They know what you look at and listen to, what you are using, which styles you like and can sell this data for money to creators. They will also sell access to you to creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HHOS: in the future at birth of child, you will first have to decide which corporate tribe it joins and then find a name compliant with that tribes rules. Switching between tribes is as complicated as an emigration to or from North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A central building block is also DRM, here under the marketing name of &amp;ldquo;NFT&amp;rdquo;. NFT is the blockchain word for DRM, only with added destruction of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unique things are only possible with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;locking the machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TPM,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in-game only licensed assets and mods usable, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NFT Laser Eyes crypto bullshit that burns the planet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context also the current engagement of Epic in the NFT bull.
Proper standards will be important, and &amp;ldquo;identity&amp;rdquo; is central for &amp;ldquo;property&amp;rdquo;.
This does not need blockchain, and will work better without - the platforms are central anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend, commenting further:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to bind these people into this universe (&amp;ldquo;Hyperinclusion&amp;rdquo;).
They buy in the metaverses store, date their partners in metaverse locations, watch ads for products only available in the metaverse, and can hardly formulate metaverse critical thinking.
There is no public space anymore, everything is part of the gated community (cf loss of the almende).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be competition between a small number of metaverses, but within one metaverse there is only managed competition.
That is, the metaverse monopolizes a life in its totality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a lot like mining towns in the US in the late 19th century.
The shop was owned by the mine, the priest was employed by the mine, and the sheriff and mayor were mine employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effectively the FB strategy is to make their social media monopoly permanent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads us to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;currency&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#currency&#34;&gt;
	Currency
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrencies have demonstrated to large players that money creation is now &amp;ldquo;up for grabs&amp;rdquo;.
A metaverse is a very good environment to realize that &amp;ldquo;en passant&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, watch the Epic engagement in crypto for details.
This is problematic:
Metaverse and production in it takes resources from the real world, but does not produce value for the real world.
The real world is getting poorer, but that is where we live.
What does that mean long term for the creation of value and money?&lt;/p&gt;

: Original Metaverse Article&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Media side:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time Netflix launched its streaming service, much of Hollywood knew that the future of television was online (IP TV had been deployed in the late 1999s). The challenge was timing and how to package such a service (it took another 10 years for Hollywood to accept all of their channels, genres and content needs to be collapsed into a single app/brand).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ball writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Metaverse, we think, will be &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persistent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synchronous and live.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be without any cap to concurrent users, while also providing each user with an individual sense of “presence”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be a fully functioning economy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be an experience that spans both the digital and physical worlds, private and public networks/experiences, and open and closed platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offer unprecedented interoperability of data, digital items/assets, content, and so on across each of these experiences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be populated by “content” and “experiences” created and operated by an incredibly wide range of contributors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Metaverse is not…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A “virtual world”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A “virtual space”  (2nd life)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Virtual reality”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A “digital and virtual economy”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &amp;ldquo;game&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A “virtual theme park or Disneyland”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A “new app store”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A “new UGC platform”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, of course, nonsense, it will be all of these things, &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt;.
This is Valley Hype to make the Next Internet sellable, and to have a common tale to tell.
But in the end this is all about the things it is supposedly NOT.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep up engagement and interest.
A problem for any MMO:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People don&amp;rsquo;t live in the metaverse, the live here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Primary consumption is casual, not high-end gamer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That is the weakness of the concept, esp Facebook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can only become a Metaverse if it becomes a permanent place.
That&amp;rsquo;s still a long road to travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My VR goggles are sitting around, idle (sold the Oculus because mandatory FB account).
That is, because &amp;ldquo;entering VR&amp;rdquo; is an act (set things up, calibrate), and the goggles isolate (when I put them on, I am &amp;ldquo;gone&amp;rdquo;), and because it is used only by very few games.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crypto bullshit with a few good ideas, but also illusions/lies about what will happen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;1/5 of FB now working on AR&amp;rdquo;, FB looks at Metaverse as &amp;ldquo;Oculus&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;VR&amp;rdquo;. That&amp;rsquo;s dangerous tunnel vision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The &amp;ldquo;Metaverse&amp;rdquo; is a virtual space created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality, AR &amp;amp; the Internet: Our current 2D search based version of the Internet is giving way to a fully 3D immersive reality&amp;rdquo;: bullshit, unless consumption becomes casual. 3D Assets in Pancake Games are easier to sell &amp;ldquo;Cosmetics&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Metaverse is always “on” &amp;amp; is beyond the control of any individual. It exists in real time, can host any size audience, has a functioning economy, spans across platforms, provides interoperability for digital assets, &amp;amp; consists of the content and experiences its users create.&amp;rdquo; That is 2nd 2nd life as a concept, and  &amp;ldquo;3D Shoppingmalls&amp;rdquo; of the early 90ies revived. As a concept not wrong, and at the same time completely wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the Metaverse, the earning power for young creators won’t be limited to the top 1%. There will be an entire new era of young entrepreneurs making a living in virtual worlds, earning real value and steady income quicker than ever imagined.&amp;rdquo; LOL. Mainly this is about a microsoft tax, that will siphon off money from creators along the way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Creators who were once limited in their ability by technological constraints, lack of capital, time, or creativity, now have everything that is needed. What happens when physical objects are dematerialized? All formerly scarce materials become abundant.&amp;rdquo; LOL. DRM all the way is a requirement to make this work. Also, the permanent promise of creators paradise, when this is really about monopolization of the value chain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital twins will act as &amp;ldquo;foundations of the metaverse&amp;rdquo; and allow people to move between real and virtual spaces&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again &amp;ldquo;2nd 2nd Life&amp;rdquo;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Skeumorphism&lt;/a&gt;

 is what we do with new tech that does not yet have its own design language. The first cars looked like coaches, and the first Apple applications mimicked Rolodexes and Moleskines. &amp;ldquo;Digital Twins&amp;rdquo; is the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core idea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2020, music artist Travis Scott staged a virtual concert inside the game that was attended live by 12.3 million people. It was a global phenomenon that sent the American rapper to the top of all music charts and earned him a reported $20 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read: &amp;ldquo;OMG, somebody has used a children&amp;rsquo;s battle royale to earn money without shooting players, but with traditional media work.&amp;rdquo;, and we are back to &amp;ldquo;all the ideas of 2nd life we know are problematic may still be valid again&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If the metaverse is an equivalent reality that coexists next to the physical reality, there needs to be a connection,&amp;rdquo; said Weir-McCall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does not need that at all. If, then more likely as AR than as 3D models, because connections to the real world is what you lose with 3D VR goggles. Casual is king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;facebook-glasshttpswwwreuterscomtechnologyfacebook-unveils-its-first-smart-glasses-2021-09-09-and-acceptance&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#facebook-glasshttpswwwreuterscomtechnologyfacebook-unveils-its-first-smart-glasses-2021-09-09-and-acceptance&#34;&gt;

 and acceptance
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Goggle were identifiable and their users vilified as glassholes.
Facebook is using Ray Bay to cover that.
There is no technical relationship between Oculus and AR.
This is about hiding the tech in the goggles to make it acceptable, and prevent a Facebook glasshole effect.
Also, AR is more casual than VR.
Fashion also allows easier re-sales of the same item, see also Apple Watch accessories.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s gonna be epic to bring the squid game to the metaverse. Salute to your team! I am a big fan of the TV series. I am super excited to have a chance to participate in this game! LFG!!!&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 20:55:51 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/10/26/metaverse.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ich &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/isotopp/status/1450739310546886657&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;schrieb auf Twitter&lt;/a&gt;

 was zum aktuellen Begriff &amp;ldquo;Metaverse&amp;rdquo;.
Das hat zu einem Kontakt mit &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/michacarl&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Michael Carl&lt;/a&gt;

 geführt, der mich in seinem &lt;a href=&#34;https://carls-zukunft.de/folge-58-how-to-build-a-metaversum-in-three-simple-steps/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Podcast&lt;/a&gt;

 haben wollte.
Meine &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_OIl_bcrjVczLQrMrVnt5IoYbitp1504mb2GbQK0EM4/edit#heading=h.wbe6wnc7fg59&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Gesprächsnotizen und Vorbereitung&lt;/a&gt;

 habe ich nun auch hier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;metaverse&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#metaverse&#34;&gt;
	Metaverse
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Begriff &amp;ldquo;Metaverse&amp;rdquo; stammt ursprünglich von Neal Stephenson, aus dem Jahre 1992, aber er ist im aktuellen Kontext von Matthew Ball in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Metaverse: What It Is, Where to Find it, Who Will Build It, and Fortnite&lt;/a&gt;

 mit Sinn gefüllt worden. Ball hat dann später &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.matthewball.vc/the-metaverse&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;mehr zum Thema&lt;/a&gt;

 geschrieben, und so den aktuellen Silicon Valley Hype erzeugt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Überlegung beginnt mit Spielen, die nicht mehr sind, was sie mal waren, sondern irgendwie mehr geworden sind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fortnite von Epic Games, in der nun auch Nicht-Fortnite-Aktivitäten stattfinden,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roblox, eine Plattform zur spielerischen Generierung von Computerspielen, und&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minecraft in der Java- und der Bedrock-Edition, um zu zeigen, wie beides auf seine Weise unternehmerische Fehlschläge sind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fortnite&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#fortnite&#34;&gt;
	Fortnite
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortnite war mal Battle Royale, aber ist inzwischen auch eine &amp;ldquo;Veranstaltungsplattform&amp;rdquo;, man kann dort Skins kaufen, Partnerschaften mit anderem IP, zum Beispiel Marvel/DC Super Heroes.
Leute haben dort Konzerte gegeben oder andere Veranstaltungen durchgeführt.
Epic unterstützt das, recht offen, weil es Fortnite so auch bei Leuten bekannt macht, die an Battle Royal und Gamer-Kultur nicht primär interessiert sind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epic Games macht auch die Unreal Engine, und die dazu gehörenden Pipelines zum Erstellen und Editieren von digitalen Game-Assets, betreibt einen Markt für diese Dinge und baut auch sonst eine lebendige Infrastruktur zur Spielerzeugung und zur Vermarktung auf.
Gewissermaßen ist dies die unsichtbare &amp;ldquo;Rückseite&amp;rdquo; von Spielen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;roblox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#roblox&#34;&gt;
	Roblox
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ganz ähnlich, aber viel mehr casual betreibt Roblox sowieso eine Plattform zur Erzeugung von Spielen, und macht so Assets, aber auch einen Markt für Assets.
Roblox ist vor allen Dingen bei jungen und sehr jungen Menschen populär, und wird bei älteren Menschen weit unterschätzt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;minecraft-in-zwei-geschmacksrichtungen&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#minecraft-in-zwei-geschmacksrichtungen&#34;&gt;
	Minecraft in zwei Geschmacksrichtungen
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minecraft ist ein Klassiker: Das originale Minecraft ist in Java geschrieben und inzwischen komplett durch Komponenten von Drittherstellern ersetzbar. Es gibt alternative Clients, alternative Server, alternative Assets.
Das Spiel ist schlecht: Es ist eine Sandbox ohne viel Story und ohne Spielziel mit primitiver Grafik, die originalen Server sind langsam und fehlerhaft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aber die Grafik ist simpel, sodass das Spiel auch auf abgelegten Kartoffelcomputern funktioniert.
Es ist alles in Java geschrieben, das sich leicht reversen und dann unkooperativ erweitern lässt, und so gibt es eine reichhaltige Community mit Moddern, Server- und Client-Plugins, und vielen anderen Erweiterungen.
Das macht das Spiel populär und zu einer &amp;ldquo;Einstiegsdroge&amp;rdquo; in die Java-Programmierung bei jungen Menschen, weil es ein unglaubliches Potenzial für Selbstmotivation bietet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nichts davon ist durch den derzeitigen Eigentümer Microsoft monetarisierbar.
Als IP ist Minecraft für Microsoft gescheitert, weil Microsoft nach dem Kauf des Spiels nicht mehr Teil der Verwertungskette ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daher gibt es von Microsoft &amp;ldquo;Minecraft Bedrock Edition&amp;rdquo;, performanter und besser designt, und von Grund auf mit einem Asset-Markt integriert.
Erweiterungen für Bedrock sind im Laden kaufbar, und nur dort.
Man muss als Anbieter IP von Microsoft lizenzieren und dann Prozente zahlen, als Kunde sowieso.
Bei den Spielern ist es deswegen kaum populär, steril und ohne eigene Kultur.
Im Vergleich zu Java Edition noch ein größerer Fehlschlag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das Bedrock-Modell ist vergleichbar mit dem Apple Entwicklermodell, aber kleiner im Scope:
Man kann nicht ernsthaft für Apple entwickeln ohne Apple-ID, Entwickler-Lizenz, Cloud-Nutzung für Handover und Storage und ohne Prozente im Apple Store zu bezahlen.
Bedrock ist danach modelliert, aber halt kein Computer-Tablet-ökosystem, sondern nur ein Spiel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;metaverse-eine-erste-definition&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#metaverse-eine-erste-definition&#34;&gt;
	Metaverse: Eine erste Definition
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die tatsächliche Definition von &amp;ldquo;Metaverse&amp;rdquo; sind also nicht 3D-Brillen, sondern &amp;ldquo;die Integration der Computerspieleindustrie mit der Wertschöpfungskette der Unterhaltungsindustrie für einen offenen, digitalen Assetmarkt&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oder offener: Das Anzapfen der Spieleverwertungskette an jeder Stelle im Produktionsfluß, und das Aufwerten der Spieleverwertungskette durch Integration mit Intellectual Property aus Filmen und Büchern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es geht also darum, aus dem Lebenszeit-Konsum-Budget einer Person mehr Geld herauszuziehen, ohne zu viel Lebenszeit bei dieser Person zu verbrauchen, also um eine Aufweitung von Ausgaben für &amp;ldquo;Medien&amp;rdquo; im aller weitesten Sinne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;budgets-für-aufmerksamkeit-und-geld&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#budgets-f%c3%bcr-aufmerksamkeit-und-geld&#34;&gt;
	Budgets für Aufmerksamkeit und Geld
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Menschen haben Geldlimits für ihre Freizeit, der &lt;a href=&#34;https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verf%C3%BCgbares_Einkommen&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Konsumanteil des verfügbaren Einkommens&lt;/a&gt;

.
Sie haben auch Zeitlimits für ihre Freizeit, ein Budget für Aufmerksamkeit.
Beides ist konvertibel, aber das hängt am Medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nimmt man eine nützliche Lebenszeit, in der ich &amp;ldquo;Lesen&amp;rdquo; kann von 60 Jahren an, und unterstellt man einem fleißigen Leser 40 Bücher (eines pro Woche) im Jahr, dann wird diese Person in ihrem Leben 2400 Bücher lesen, im Wert von sagen wir ~30 Euro pro Stück.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arbeitet man mit Computerspielen der AAA-Klasse, dann schafft man eventuell 4-6 Spiele im Jahr sinnvoll durchzuspielen, also im Leben 240-300 Titel, im Wert von ~60 Euro pro Stück.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das setzt eine Größenordnung von Lebensumsatz pro Person für diese Dinge, also ~70k Euro in Büchern oder 20k Euro in Spielen pro Personenleben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir sehen insbesondere, daß Spiele im Vergleich zu ihrem Produktionsaufwand viel zu billig sind, aber ein höherer Preis als 60 Euro ist auch für einen AAA-Titel nicht durchsetzbar.
Das ist einer der Gründe, warum in jedem einzelnen dieser Spiele weitere Möglichkeiten zum Geldausgeben enthalten sind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generell ist es aber bei beiden Medien so, daß das Geldausgeben im Vergleich zu der aufgewendeten Zeit zu langsam ist:
Die Burnrate muss hoch.
Bücher, aber auch Filme und insbesondere AAA-Titel von Computerspielen sind viel zu werthaltig, und ihr Konsum ist zu aufwendig.
Wir suchen was anderes, bei dem nicht so viele Minuten Lebenszeit pro ausgegebenem Euro aufgewendet werden müsse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist kritisch, weil es ja auch noch viele freie Inhalte gibt, die auch um Aufmerksamkeit buhlen und &amp;ldquo;gut genug&amp;rdquo; sind, um bezahlte Inhalte zu verdrängen.
Sie kosten Minuten Aufmerksamkeit, ohne Geld zu verdienen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nebenschauplatz-sterben-und-erben&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#nebenschauplatz-sterben-und-erben&#34;&gt;
	Nebenschauplatz: Sterben und Erben
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angesichts der alternden Bevölkerung gibt es auch noch den Nebenschauplatz &amp;ldquo;Boomer sterben, Kinder erben&amp;rdquo;.
Ich habe zum Beispiel genau jetzt ca. 600 Steam Titel und 1000 Kindle Books.
Wenn ich sterbe, sind das einige 10k Euro Wert.
Wie vererbe ich die meinem Sohn?
Die Politik hat keine Antworten, und die Hersteller lassen das nicht zu.
Ich kann meinem Kind also nur mein Steam Login vermachen und von meinen Kindle-Büchern das DRM knacken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wirtschaftlich sind Kindle und Steam-Erbschaften für die Hersteller weitgehend irrelevant, oder wären sogar positiv, und es ist unklar, wieso man sich so sträubt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn ein Haus am See erbe, kann ich da hereingehen, die Veranda aufschließen, in den Park gehen und so das Asset genießen.
Das kostet mich nicht viel Zeit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erbe ich dagegen eine Kindle- oder Steam-Library, kostet mich das viel Zeit in der Erschließung:
Wenn ich 1200 Bücher erbe, sind das 30 Jahre Lebenszeit, die ich investieren muss, um das Erbe zu verarbeiten.
Wenn ich 1000 Spiele erbe, sind da Titel von 2002 bei, die heute wie Dreck aussehen.
Ich erbe &amp;ldquo;Skyrim&amp;rdquo;, muss aber &amp;ldquo;Skyrim VR&amp;rdquo; und &amp;ldquo;Skyrim Remastered&amp;rdquo; selbst kaufen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir sehen sofort: Erben ist für den Hersteller kein relevanter Umsatzverlust, sondern eher noch ein Mittel zur Verkaufsförderung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;assets-hoher-geldaufwand-geringer-zeitaufwand&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#assets-hoher-geldaufwand-geringer-zeitaufwand&#34;&gt;
	Assets: hoher Geldaufwand, geringer Zeitaufwand
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bereits heute ist in Spielen neben Lootboxen und Pay-to-Win und Pay-to-Skip Modellen der Verkauf von Cosmetics eine der größten Einnahmequellen, und im Gegensatz zu den anderen Geldquellen weitgehend unumstritten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay-to-Win: Das Spiel ist nicht erfolgreich zu beenden, außer man kauft Ausrüstungsgegenstände für Echtgeld dazu. Idealerweise wird das erst sichtbar, wenn man bereits eine Menge Zeit und Emotion in das Spiel investiert hat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay-to-Skip: Das Spiel wird immer wieder durch ärgerliche Wartepausen unterbrochen, in denen man nicht weiterspielen kann, außer man kauft die Pause durch Echtgeld weg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lootboxen: Das Spiel verkauft einem Container einem zufälligen Inhalt an Spielgegenständen, bei denen selten wertvolle Dinge enthalten sind. Das eigentliche Spiel ist also eine Verpackung für ein Glücksspiel im Inneren. Diese Praxis ist mittlerweile in einigen EU-Ländern verboten.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Im Gegensatz dazu sind Cosmetics weitgehend unumstritten: Das sind Gegenstände, die der Spielfigur und ihrer Ausrüstung ein anderes Aussehen geben, ein virtuelles Haus und seine Einrichtung, die auf das Spiel keine wesentliche Auswirkung haben und ähnliches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Im Spiel &amp;ldquo;Elder Scrolls Online&amp;rdquo; zum Beispiel bekommt man als Spieler leicht und zu geringen Kosten virtuelle Wohnhäuser in der Spielwelt, die sehr spektakulär liegen und aussehen und viel leeren Platz bieten.
Gegenstände zum Einrichten kann man sich als Trophäen erspielen, aber wesentliche Alltagsgegenstände zur Einrichtung sind nur via Echtgeld-Einsatz im Shop zu kaufen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das für den Hersteller wunderbare dabei:
Der Spieler kann in den Kauf von Cosmetics beliebig viel Geld reinpumpen und wird dabei kaum Lebenszeit oder Aufmerksamkeit aufbringen müssen.
Limitierend kann also nur die Geldbörse des Kunden wirken, nicht aber sein Zeitbudget.
Das macht so etwas zu einem viel besseren Geschäftsfeld als Bücher, Filme oder die Spiele selbst.
Das Spiel liefert nur den Kontext und Anlass für die Cosmetics zu existieren und bestimmt ihr Aussehen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epic-games&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#epic-games&#34;&gt;
	Epic Games
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dies ist genau die Geschäftsgrundlage von Epic Games:
Mit der Unreal Engine bietet die Firma eine Plattform zum schnellen und effizienten Design von sehr gut aussehenden Videospielen.
Dazu gehören auch Werkzeuge zum Erzeugen der Ingame-Assets, aber auch der Betrieb einer Verkaufsplattform für solche Assets an Spielhersteller.
Mit dem Epic Launcher und dem darin integrierten Shop auch eine Plattform zum Verkauf von Spielen, und zum Erfassen von Meta- und Nutzungsdaten an Epic, die dann wiederum (gegen Geld) dem Spielhersteller als Analytics angeboten werden.
Das von Epic betriebene Payment-System ist die Pipeline, über die Geld vom Kunden zum Spielhersteller fließen kann, und über die nicht nur die Spiele, sondern auch Erweiterungen, In-Game Käufe und andere Geldausgaben abgewickelt werden können.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mit Fortnite hat man aber auch ein eigenes Spiel am Start, das zugleich auch 3D Assets an Endkunden als Ausrüstungsgegenstände, Cosmetics oder sonst wie verkaufen kann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortnite ist eine bestimmte Sorte Spiel - Player vs. Player, im Battle Royal Modus, Spieler treten gegeneinander an und der letzte Überlebende gewinnt.
Diese Sorte Spiel ist nicht für alle Zielgruppen interessant, aber die Engine von Fortnite lässt sich auch anderweitig nutzen.
Entsprechend weckt man Interesse durch Nutzung von Fortnite als &amp;ldquo;virtuelle Veranstaltungsplattform&amp;rdquo; und hält das Interesse durch Media Tie-Ins und Licensed IP aufrecht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Interpretation von Metaverse als Verwertungskette von digitalen Assets, speziell 3D Assets, als &amp;ldquo;Online-Merchandise&amp;rdquo; greift jedoch zu kurz:
Als Ökosystem mit einer kontrollierten Anzahl von großen Marktbetreibern und einer großen Anzahl von Kunden und Kreativen steht man viel besser und vor allen Dingen dauerhafter da.
Man kann Dritten auf diese Weise erlauben, untereinander Handel zu treiben, aber dabei laufend einen geringen Anteil an allen Transaktionen abgreifen.
Gewissermaßen will man die Idee der &amp;ldquo;Microsoft-Tax&amp;rdquo; in einem anderen Kontext wieder aufleben lassen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unterschiedliche Ausgangspositionen bei&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Epic Games/Fortnite - schwach bei IP, aber original IP, wenn auch Nische, Unreal Engine und die anderen Dinge auf der &amp;ldquo;Rückseite&amp;rdquo; der Spiele als große Stärke.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roblox - original IP, sehr junge Kundschaft, erzieht sich gerade Kinder, 10 Jahre warten, groß unterschätzt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft - Minecraft, MS Store et al, zu Enterprise um erfolgreich zu sein? Aber Halo, MSFS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple (sic!) - kein IP, aber Plattform/Kette.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disney (sic!) - nur IP, aber schwach in Verwertung außerhalb von Filmen/offline Merchandise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook - will da unbedingt rein, &amp;ldquo;Enterprise Pivot&amp;rdquo;: wenn Social in Zukunft &amp;ldquo;hier&amp;rdquo; stattfindet, dann muss Facebook &amp;ldquo;hier&amp;rdquo; sein.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google - insbesondere der Grund, wieso Google Stadia nicht wirklich einstellen kann, selbst wenn es ein Flop wird/ist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon - hier ist auch die Spiele Strategie von Amazon mit einordnen. Amazon wäre gerne das AWS der Spielewelt anstelle von Epic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;

 als Market Maturity Model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir sind derzeit in einer chaotischen Phase der Marktentwicklung:
Niemand hat ein Geschäftsmodell in diesem Markt, es ist unklar, wie dieser überhaupt aussehen wird.
Standards existieren noch nicht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es geht um Landgrab, also um den Aufbau von Marktanteilen in einem entstehenden und wachsenden Markt.
Interop ist sekundär, weil noch keine Idee vorhanden ist, wie die Standards aussehen werden.
Man versucht sich vom Mitbewerb durch Features zu differenzieren, und dabei auch herauszufinden, was wichtig ist.
Alle Spieler wachsen in einem wachsenden, entstehenden Markt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sobald es ein Geschäftsmodell, stabile Featurelisten und ein System zur Geldextraktion gibt, wird sich der Markt konsolidieren.
Dann beherrschen 3-5 Firmen den Markt, der auch aus dem Hyperwachstum heraus geht.
Die marktbeherrschenden Firmen erkennen einander an und konkurrieren semi-kooperativ miteinander:
Es ist wichtiger, den Marktzugang von Disruptoren zu erschweren, und es wird komplexe, schwierig zu implementierende Standards geben, mit Compliance Prüfungen und anderen Kostenfaktoren.
Das wird dann aber auch - zähneknirschend - zu Interoperabilität führen.&lt;/p&gt;

	Metaverse, überarbeitete Definition
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das führt uns zur überarbeiteten Definition von Metaverse:
Die Integration der Spieleindustrie mit der Unterhaltungsindustrie und die Integration der Wertschöpfungsketten, mit der Möglichkeit die Verwertungskette an jeder Stelle im Produktionsfluß mit einer Art Steuer zu belegen.
Ein systematisches Anzapfen des Lifetime Intellectual Property-Konsumbudgets einer Person, und die Aufweitung des Marktes, der für einen Konsumenten relevant ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Erkenntnis, daß Buch, Filme und Spiele zu zeitaufwendig zu erstellen und zu konsumieren sind.
3D Assets ist viel größere Verkaufsgelegenheit, ohne daß der Kunde so viel Lebenszeit investieren muss, um tatsächlich den Kauf zu konsumieren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vor diesem Hintergrund ist auch die laufende Auseinandersetzung von Epic vs. Apple und Google vor Gericht zu lesen: Es geht darum, das Anzapf-Monopol von Apple und den von Apple dominierten Markt für andere zu Öffnen zu unterminieren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besondere deutsche Probleme dabei:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keine Infrastruktur für Highspeed, Low Latency wie man das für Spiele braucht.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keine deutsche Firma mit nennenswerter Identity Plattform (web.de? T-Online? &amp;ldquo;Login mit x&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keine deutschen Ressourcen im 3D-Asset Tooling, Produktion, &amp;hellip; Markt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keine deutsche Film/Fernseh/Lit Industrie zur Produktion von IP, Stories, die weltweit wiedererkennbare Kultur prägen, die man verkaufen kann.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deutscher Blick geht nach innen, ins eigene Land, nicht auf einen Weltmarkt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vergleiche dabei Korea: koreanische Produktionsketten in K-Pop; die &amp;ldquo;cultural technology&amp;rdquo; die andere Stile und Kunstrichtungen aufgreift und in K-Pop integriert; Produktionspipelines für Stars und Sternchen, aber auch für IP (beginnend).
Im Vergleich ist Deutschland essenziell wehrlos und angehängt.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#toxisch-dystopische-interpretation&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das &amp;ldquo;Eigentum&amp;rdquo; in einer simulierten Realität sieht aus wie Eigentum, ist aber virtuell und kopierbar.
Es kommt im virtuellen zur einer Entfernung von Ressourcenknappheit bei der Produktion, aber &amp;ldquo;Wert&amp;rdquo; entsteht nur, wenn die Ware künstlich verknappt wird beim Konsum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Zollhaus-Stellen, Plattformbetreiber haben volle Markttransparenz, und können das Freizeit-Konsumverhalten jeder Person genau ausmessen.
Sie wissen, was Du siehst und hörst, was Du benutzt, welche Stile Dir zusagen und können diese Information gegen Geld an Kreative verkaufen, und verkaufen den Kreativen auch gegen Geld den Zugang zu Dir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein Freund von mir:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nur ein halber Witz: man muss in Zukunft bei Geburt eines Kindes als Erstes entscheiden muss, ob es Apple-, Google- oder Facebook-Angehöriger wird und der Name erst danach entsprechend den Regeln des Dienstes festgelegt wird. Wechsel zwischen den Services ist dann komplex wie eine Emigration nach Nordkorea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zentraler Bestandteil bezüglich der Verknappung auch DRM, hier unter dem Modenamen &amp;ldquo;NFT&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;NFT&amp;rdquo; ist das Blockchain Wort für DRM, nur zusätzlich mit Umweltvergiftung durch Energieverschwendung.
Unikate gibt es nur mit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rechner zunageln,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TPM,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in-game nur lizenzierte Assets und Mods verwendbar, und&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NFT Laser Eyes Kryptoscheisse, die den Planeten verbrennt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In diesem Kontext ist auch das aktuelle Engagement von Epic im NFT Misthaufen zu lesen sehen.
Daher: korrekte Standards sind wichtig, und Identität ist die Grundlage für &amp;ldquo;Eigentum&amp;rdquo;.
Das braucht nicht nur keine Blockchain, es funktioniert auch besser ohne - die Plattformen sind eh zentral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Freund kommentiert wieder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es geht darum, dass die Leute aus dem Universum nicht rauskommen können (Stichwort: Hyperinklusion).
Sie kaufen in Metaverse-Shops, daten ihre Partner in Metaverse-Locations, sehen nur noch Werbung für im Metaverse verfügbare Waren, können Metaverse-kritische Gedanken kaum noch formulieren.
Es gibt keinen Public-Space mehr im Leben, alles ist Teil der gated community (Vgl. Verlust der Almende).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Du hast vielleicht noch einen Wettbewerb zwischen x Metaversen, aber innerhalb eines Metaversums gibt es dann einen oder nur noch einen gesteuerten Wettbewerb.
D.h. das Metaversum monopolisiert den Menschen in seiner Gesamtheit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist ein bisschen wie die Minenstädte in den USA Ende des 19. Jhd.
Der Shop gehörte der Mine, der Pfarrer arbeitete für die Mine, die Mine stellte Sheriff und Bürgermeister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effektiv will FB durch das Metaversum ihr gegenwärtiges Social-Media-Monopol verewigen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das führt thematisch zur Geldtheorie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;currency&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#currency&#34;&gt;
	Currency
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durch die CryptoCurrencies ist für die großen jetzt klar, dass die Geldschöpfung &amp;ldquo;up for the grabs&amp;rdquo; ist. Ein Metaversum wäre der perfekte Ansatz das &amp;ldquo;en passant&amp;rdquo; zu realisieren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An dieser Stelle kommt dann gleich wieder das Epic Engagement bei &amp;ldquo;Cryptocurrentcies&amp;rdquo; zum Tragen.
Das ist sehr problematisch:
Metaversum und Produktion dort nimmt nur Ressourcen aus der realen Welt, produziert dort aber nicht.
Am Ende wird die reale Welt ärmer, dort leben wir aber.
Was heißt das langfristig für Wertschöpfung und Geld?&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;rdquo;, Videospiele Growth Manager, ein Bericht. Richtige Richtung, zu kurz, erklärt aber die Kette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Im Gegensatz zu einem typischen Videospiel, bei dem man versucht, so viele Leute wie möglich dazu zu bringen, einmalig 60 Dollar für ein Spiel auszugeben, will ein Free-to-Play Spiel so viele Leute wie möglich zum Spielen zu animieren. Sobald sie spielen, bemüht sich das Unternehmen, so viele digitale Güter wie möglich an sie zu verkaufen. Es gibt zwar eine Obergrenze dafür, wie viel man für ein Spiel verlangen kann, aber es gibt keine Obergrenze für die Zahl an sinnlosen digitalen Tokens, die man verhökern kann.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time Netflix launched its streaming service, much of Hollywood knew that the future of television was online (IP TV had been deployed in the late 1999s). The challenge was timing and how to package such a service (it took another 10 years for Hollywood to accept all of their channels, genres and content needs to be collapsed into a single app/brand).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ball schreibt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Metaverse, we think, will be &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persistent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synchronous and live.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be without any cap to concurrent users, while also providing each user with an individual sense of “presence”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be a fully functioning economy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be an experience that spans both the digital and physical worlds, private and public networks/experiences, and open and closed platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offer unprecedented interoperability of data, digital items/assets, content, and so on across each of these experiences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be populated by “content” and “experiences” created and operated by an incredibly wide range of contributors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Metaverse is not…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A “virtual world”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A “virtual space”  (2nd life)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Virtual reality”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A “digital and virtual economy”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &amp;ldquo;game&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A “new app store”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A “new UGC platform”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist natürlich Unsinn, es wird alle diese Dinge &lt;em&gt;auch&lt;/em&gt; sein.
Das ist alles Valley Hype, um The Next Internet als Begriff zu etablieren und eine gemeinsame Erzählung zu haben.
Aber am Ende ist geht es genau um diese 8 Dinge die es angeblich NICHT sein soll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Es geht darum, User Engagement zu erhalten.
Das Problem muss jedes MMO lösen, denn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Die Leute leben nicht im Metaverse, die leben hier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Primärer Konsum ist Casual, nicht High End Gamer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Das ist die Schwachstelle des Konzeptes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erst wenn das Ding zu einem ständigen Ort wird, kann es ein Metaversum werden.
Das ist noch ein langer Weg:
Meine VR-Brille steht hier ungenutzt rum (Oculus verkauft, wegen FB Zwang).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist so, weil &amp;ldquo;in VR zu gehen&amp;rdquo; ein Akt ist (aufbauen, kalibrieren), und die Brille isoliert (ich bin dann weg), und weil es nicht viele Spiele gibt, die das sinnvoll nutzen (Elite Dangerous, MSFS-2020, Moss, selten auch Space Pirate Trainer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crypto Dummlall mit einigen guten Ideen, aber Illusionen über wie es laufen wird&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;1/5 of Facebook now working on AR&amp;rdquo;, für FB ist das Metaverse zur Zeit &amp;ldquo;Oculus&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;VR&amp;rdquo;. Das ist ein gefährlicher Tunnelblick (siehe oben &amp;ldquo;casual&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The &amp;ldquo;Metaverse&amp;rdquo; is a virtual space created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality, AR &amp;amp; the internet: Our current 2D search based version of the internet is giving way to a fully 3D immersive reality&amp;rdquo;: Das ist Quatsch, solange 3D nicht komplett Casual konsumierbar wird, und eine 3D Brille ist derzeit isolierend, schwer und verkabelt. 3D Assets in Pancake Games sind leichter und direkt zu verkaufen, jetzt. &amp;ldquo;Cosmetics&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Metaverse is always “on” &amp;amp; is beyond the control of any individual. It exists in real time, can host any size audience, has a functioning economy, spans across platforms, provides interoperability for digital assets, &amp;amp; consists of the content and experiences its users create.&amp;rdquo; Das Konzept 2nd 2nd Life, und die &amp;ldquo;3D Shoppingmalls&amp;rdquo; der frühen 90er feiern fröhliche Urständ, als Konzept nicht falsch und gleichzeitig total falsch. 3D Events, die Presence ersetzen sind interessant, aber super hart.
Auch hier Korean Cultural Technology, K-POP Konsum während COVID-19 (Pancake, large Audiences, Gemeinschaftserlebnisse, &amp;ldquo;VR&amp;rdquo; Nebensache)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the Metaverse, the earning power for young creators won’t be limited to the top 1%. There will be an entire new era of young entrepreneurs making a living in virtual worlds, earning real value and steady income quicker than ever imagined.&amp;rdquo; LOL. In erster Linie geht es um Zollhäuschen entlang der Verwertungskette, mit dem durch Creators erschaffenen Mehrwert als Motor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Creators who were once limited in their ability by technological constraints, lack of capital, time, or creativity, now have everything that is needed. What happens when physical objects are dematerialized? All formerly scarce materials become abundant.&amp;rdquo; LOL. DRM all the way ist notwendig, damit das funktioniert. Außerdem das Dauerversprechen vom Creators Paradise, wenn es tatsächlich um Monopolisierung der Wertschöpfungskette geht.&lt;/li&gt;

 ist, was wir machen, wenn wir noch nicht wissen, was die Design Language für eine neue Welt ist. Die ersten Autos sagen aus wie Kutschen, die ersten Apple Anwendungen haben Rolodexe und Moleskine imitiert. &amp;ldquo;Digital Twins&amp;rdquo; sind dasselbe Konzept, aber für ein Metaversum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Und die Kernidee:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2020, music artist Travis Scott staged a virtual concert inside the game that was attended live by 12.3 million people. It was a global phenomenon that sent the American rapper to the top of all music charts and earned him a reported $20 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lies: &amp;ldquo;OMG, jemand hat in einem Kinder-Battle Royale Spiel Geld verdient ohne zu metzeln, sondern mit traditioneller Medienarbeit&amp;rdquo; führt sofort zu &amp;ldquo;Alle Ideen von 2nd Life, von denen wir schon wissen, dass sie problematisch sind, feiern Wiederauferstehung.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If the metaverse is an equivalent reality that coexists next to the physical reality, there needs to be a connection,&amp;rdquo; said Weir-McCall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ist es nicht, muss es nicht. Wenn es dann doch muss, eventuell eher AR als 3D-Modelle, denn Connection zur realen Welt hat man mit einer vollen VR-Brille eben nicht. Was ich oben über Casual Konsum sage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mein Freund merkt an:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital Twins / Digital Shadows sind übrigens auch Begriffe um den die Datenspur von Leuten zu bezeichnen.
Der Gesundheitsbereich versucht das ebenso zu etablieren, um anhand dieser Zwillinge Diagnostik betreiben zu können.
Das wird auch noch einmal spannend, wie das mit dem Metaverse verbunden wird.
Gerade aus Facebooks Sicht - welche Daten kann das Metaversum aus Deinem Avatar auslesen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 und Akzeptanz
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bei Google Brille waren die Träger erkennbar, der Begriff Glassholes entstand.
Mit Ray Ban ist das besser zu tarnen.
Ray Ban hat keinen technischen Beitrag zu Oculus und AR, es geht nur darum, den Markennamen und das Design als Tarnung für Oculus zu nehmen, um den Google Glass Effect zu vermeiden.
Außerdem ist AR mehr Casual als VR.
Mode erlaubt auch einfacheren Neuverkauf, siehe auch Apple Watch Zubehör.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s gonna be epic to bring the squid game to the metaverse. Salute to your team! I am a big fan of the TV series. I am super excited to have a chance to participate in this game! LFG!!!&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Sep 2021 16:19:51 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/09/05/fertig-gelesen-ai-superpowers.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This 2018 book in some aspects is already outdated: Silicon Valley Techbro Kai-Fu Lee describes what AI is and what he thinks it will do to our future, the nature of work and the job market.
But since then, the worlds view on what AI can and cannot do, what the problems to solve really are and a lot of other things have changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/AI-Superpowers-Silicon-Valley-English-ebook/dp/B0795DNWCF&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2021/09/ai-superpowers.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/AI-Superpowers-Silicon-Valley-English-ebook/dp/B0795DNWCF&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;AI Superpowers:China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order&lt;/a&gt;

, Kai-Fu Lee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kai-Fu Lee is a Taiwanese born, American computer scientist, and worked at Apple, SGI, Microsoft and Google before becoming a venture capitalist in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He coined the adage &amp;ldquo;If data is the new oil, then China is the new Saudi Arabia&amp;rdquo; and in the books proposes that China has several advantages over the US in an arms race over artificial intelligence:
Generally training deep learning models seems to be better suited to the Chinese approach of brute forcing a solution than to deep engineering;
China has few data protection regulations getting in the way of data collection;
Chinese startup culture is even more aggressive than the US one; and
the chinese government funds and steers the startup industry in China into the AI of AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee believes that a number of jobs will be modified or eliminated by a potential AI revolution, including a number of white collar (office) jobs.
The examples he gives are jobs that consist mostly of - in his opinion - simple pattern recognition, such as rough translator, bank loan officer or customer care worker.
Similarly, the blue collar (worker) jobs at risk are truck driver, cashier or clothing factory worker.
In a way, three years later, his estimates look overly optimistic:
Self-driving cars are further away than they looked three years ago, and automated customer care with natural language recognition quickly transformed into the voice-mail hell as ten or twenty years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is true is that AI can support human workers a lot in taking the boring parts of these jobs away, helping to provide rough estimates and marking clear cases as such.
Still, AI in 2021 seems to be successful where it augments human workers instead of completely replacing them.
In general, Lee&amp;rsquo;s view of the world is very mechanistic, and way too optimistic in what AI can actually completely solve without having a complete model of the world it acts in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important input and still a good overview, but overtaken quickly by the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Sep 2021 13:53:05 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/09/05/fertig-gelesen-old-mans-war.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/Old-Mans-English-John-Scalzi-ebook/dp/B000SEIK2S&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Old Man&amp;rsquo;s War&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;rdquo; is the first &amp;ldquo;large&amp;rdquo; works by John Scalzi,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/Old-Mans-English-John-Scalzi-ebook/dp/B000SEIK2S&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2021/09/oldmanswar.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/Old-Mans-English-John-Scalzi-ebook/dp/B000SEIK2S&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Old Man&amp;rsquo;s War&lt;/a&gt;

, John Scalzi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot premise is weird, but simple: Humanity has taken to the stars, but with private enterprise.
Basically all advanced space technology is controlled by the Colonial Union.
Life on earth on the other hand goes on almost as before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Perry enlists to serve in the Colonial Defense Force at the age of 75, to protect humanity, but mostly to have the CU fight the effects of him aging with some unspecified Scifi tech.
He leaves earth and during his induction to the CDF learns that he will be indeed rejuvenated, by transferring his consciousness into a new, young, genetically engineered body tailored for planetary combat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perry&amp;rsquo;s first tour of duty sees battles on a number of CU planets and fights against various interstellar races.
He soon learns that the CU is not actually involved much in galactic politics and has only limited knowledge about the background and motivation of the various space-faring intelligences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fight against the man-eating Rraey leaves him wounded and left for dead on the contested planet Coral.
He is found by a member of the Ghost Brigades,  Jane Sagan, that he thinks looks like a younger version of his deceased wife Kathy, and befriends her.
He learns that Ghost Brigades are synthetic humans created from the DNA scans of CDF volunteers that died before they could join the CDF, but without the memory and experience of their human predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While technically Mil SciFi, and therefore a genre I despise, Scalzi manages to keep the focus the story on the characters and their interactions instead of troop movements and space battles.
He is playing with the themes of generic engineering, encounters with alien races and the discovery of their motivation, and with building a connection to an image of a loved one, but without the memory and the shared experiences.
An engaging book with characters I can relate to, and a story well told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/Old-Mans-English-John-Scalzi-ebook/dp/B000SEIK2S&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Old Man&amp;rsquo;s War&lt;/a&gt;

 is continued in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/Ghost-Brigades-Mans-Book-English-ebook/dp/B001QS9TSE&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Ghost Brigades&lt;/a&gt;

 and in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B000YJ85BI&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Last Colony&lt;/a&gt;

, finishing the John Perry&amp;rsquo;s viewpoint books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of &amp;ldquo;The Last Colony&amp;rdquo; is being retold in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B002ENBLM2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Zoe&amp;rsquo;s Tale&lt;/a&gt;

 from another character&amp;rsquo;s viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/Human-Division-Mans-Book-English-ebook/dp/B00C2RSA9C&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Human Division&lt;/a&gt;

 then continues the original storyline, from another characters point of view, dealing with the aftermath of the revelation of the CU&amp;rsquo;s scheming with earth politics. Humanity finally joins the emerging galactic society and must find a place in one of the various alliances that the different intelligent species begin to form. The resulting diplomatic complications are further told in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00SEPVPAW&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The End of All Things&lt;/a&gt;

 in a series of Novellas from different character viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all a series very worthwhile reading, exactly sufficient for one vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

, Ram V &amp;amp; Sumit Kumar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1760&amp;rsquo;ies.
An english vampire puts his peers at risk by not having his desires unter control, and is exiled to Calicut, India.
He soon finds out that even older and fiercer beings rule the night: Rakshasa, the Vampire equivalent of Indian Myth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bishan, a Raskshasa, kills the vampire, drawing the english vampires out for revenge.
Before the background of a colonization war in India, Bishan and the vampire master Jurre Granno clash, first in India, then in England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fantastic illustrations, and a complex story well told, with rich metaphors, showing a clash of cultures and the infighting in pre-colonization India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a comic, the kindle edition does not read well on a Kindle, but works fine on Kindle for iPad or similar devices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Max Gladstone and Amal El-Mohtar co-authored &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/This-How-Lose-Time-English-ebook/dp/B07RTYNHRM&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;This Is How You Lose The Time-War&lt;/a&gt;

, not exactly a Science Fiction novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/This-How-Lose-Time-English-ebook/dp/B07RTYNHRM&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/This-How-Lose-Time-English-ebook/dp/B07RTYNHRM&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;This Is How You Lose The Time War&lt;/a&gt;

, Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red and Blue are representatives, spies and saboteurs of two nearly all-powerful, warring factions.
They travel through time to manipulate events at critical points in history in favor of their respective factions.
They are leaving each other messages, they taunt each other, and gradually earn mutual respect.
Eventually they grow close to each other, and love develops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red&amp;rsquo;s commanding officer learns of the interaction and forces Red to leave a message to Blue that kills her.
Red later fixes that &amp;ldquo;problem&amp;rdquo; by traveling into Blue&amp;rsquo;s childhood to give her immunity to the toxic message, and both escape the war by making off to elsewhere in time and space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an epistolary novel, written in the form of the letters Red and Blue exchange.
We only learn very gradually about the characters, their capabilities and their background, and it becomes clear that what we read is not actually the account of two humans, but rather godlike entities or avatars of forces of nature.
Red and Blue over time grow close, and solve an initially unbridgeable conflict between the cultures or forces they represent at a very personal level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a hard read, and if you were looking for an actual Science Fiction story, this isn&amp;rsquo;t one.
Telling a story in the form of letters and having characters that are only remotely human at best is not a good vehicle to create tension, of paint a clear picture of what goes on.
At multiple points the book reads more like some form of poetry as opposed a novel or regular prose.
The storytelling ultimately manages to pull off a somewhat satisfactory ending, though, even if it is visible from almost the very start of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being so different and not fucking things up of course won the book a number of awards in 2019 and 2020, so there is that.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dave Addey ran a Tumblr once, titled &amp;ldquo;Typeset in the Future&amp;rdquo;, in which he dissected the typography of Science Fiction films.
This has been turned into the eponymous book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/Typeset-Future-Typography-Science-Fiction-ebook/dp/B07G7SGRZ2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;

, Dave Addey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Addey nerded out over the fonts in a Science Fiction movie and discovered it was an Eurostile variant (&amp;ldquo;Eurostile Extended Bold&amp;rdquo;).
He started a Tumblr about this, and in great detail went through a number of movies, and about every sign, letter and font used in there.
The Tumblr became quite successful, and he turned the most important posts into a book, adding a lot of images with examples and a number of interviews and essays to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ebook is a joy to read on anything but a Kindle - I did on a 10&amp;quot; iPad, and it worked quite well.
The dead tree edition would make an excellent conversation piece.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The memoir of Brian Kernighan, and the story of how UNIX came to be and what working at Bell Labs was like at that time:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/UNIX-History-English-Brian-Kernighan-ebook/dp/B07ZQHX3R1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;UNIX: A History and a Memoir&lt;/a&gt;

 is required reading for anyone who wants to know where Unix concepts came from and what ideas were behind its inception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/UNIX-History-English-Brian-Kernighan-ebook/dp/B07ZQHX3R1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2021/09/unix.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/UNIX-History-English-Brian-Kernighan-ebook/dp/B07ZQHX3R1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;UNIX: A History and a Memoir&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;quot;, Brian Kernighan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kernighan takes us through the history and the setting of Bell Labs, why it existed and what it did.
He explains the hardware of the time, in terms of size, power and capabilities, and why Bell did get involved into writing an Operating System, and the failure of Multics.
Unix inception and its co-evolution with the C language was a kind of response to the Multics project, at the same time pioneering novel ideas and taking tested salvageable concepts from Multics, making something new and much more useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While he roughly follows the timeline of Unix releases, Kernighan takes short detours, including mini-biographies of his colleagues and the influence they had on the design of the system and the ideas embodied in it.
He finishes with the commercialization of Unix, Unix descendants - BSD, Minix, Linux and Plan 9, and with the closure of Bell Labs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you work with Linux, the C language or any Unix tools, you should read this book to understand where these things came from and what formed this environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Chu has a small sherpa company, an outfit that helps causal players who have the coin to experience hard content in MMORPGs in an easy and successful way without investing too much time into the game.
Chu is coming out of a relationship with a borderline gamer, Darla, and is being asked by an obviously powerful and demanding anonymous client to be shown several well known MMOs to better understand their genres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chu is trying to uncover the identity of his client, and comes to believe that he is the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.
In the course of his research he learns the real identities of his employees, none of which are what he thought they were, and the real identity of Darla, who is way further past the borderline that he originally assumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a fun read for me, because it relatively accurately portrays MMOs and online games.
At the same time Ruff&amp;rsquo;s writing very causally avoids Gamer Dudebro stereotypes and shows that people playing video games are way more diverse than their cliche.
If you ever have had your Internet spaceship refueled by a 60+ year old english granny and ex-schoolteacher you will understand exactly what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Paul Fischer writes &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00OMH54L2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;A Kim Jong-Il Production&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;rdquo;, a documentary the 1978 abduction of the famous South Korean actress Madam Choi, and her ex-husband, the filmmaker Shin Sang-Ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before becoming the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-Il headed the Ministry for Propaganda.
Dissatisfied with the talent available, he had the famous actress Choi Eun-Hee kidnammed.
When her ex-husband started to investigate, he had him kidnapped in Hong Kong and transported to North Korea by ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, they made &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abduction_of_Shin_Sang-ok_and_Choi_Eun-hee#Films&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;seven films&lt;/a&gt;

 for Kim Jong-Il, gaining his trust.
During a research trip in Vienna they fled to the US embassy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abduction_of_Shin_Sang-ok_and_Choi_Eun-hee&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this true story&lt;/a&gt;

 to shed a light on life in North Korea, and to explain how it became the hermetically sealed country it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seventh film of Choi and Shin, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCKSR0JArUQ&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Pulgasari&lt;/a&gt;

, can be found on Youtube with english subtitles. It is a Godzilla-like monster tale, in which a rice toy of a blacksmiths daugther comes to life and turns into a giant metal-eating monster fighting for the rights of poor farmers in feudal Korea. When the monster eventually turns aganst the farmers, the blacksmiths daugther sacrifices herself killing the monster.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tommmy Krappweis ist nicht nur der Schöpfer von &amp;ldquo;Bernd, das Brot&amp;rdquo;, sondern auch ein Musiker, Stuntman, Filmemacher und Autor diverser Bücher.
In der Trilogie um &amp;ldquo;Mara und der Feuerbringer&amp;rdquo; nimmt er uns mit in die Geschichten um die 14-jährige Münchnerin Mara Lorbeer in der Welt der nordischen Sagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07RHCGD95&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

, Band 1&amp;quot;, Tommy Krappweis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mara Lorbeer ist 14, Scheidungskind und lebt bei ihrer esoterisch angehauchten Mutter in München.
Während der Rückreise von einem Baum-Umwarmungs-Seminar, auf das sie ihre Mutter mitgeschleppt hat, wird sie von einem sprechenden Zweig angesprochen, der ihr mitteilt, daß sie eine germanische Seherin ist, die den Weltuntergang, Ragnarök, verhindern muß.
Im Fortgang der Geschichte freundet sich Mara mit verschiedenen Personen an: dem Professor für germanische Mythologie Reinhold Weissinger, seiner Ex-Frau Stefanie Warnatzsch-Abra, SIegfried dem Drachentöter, dem nordischen Gott.
Zusammen treten sie gegen Loge, den Feuerbringer, den mysteriösen Dr. Thurisaz, und den Drachen Nidhöggr.
Über drei Bände entfaltet sich um Mara der Kampf der Guten gegen die Bösen im Reich der nordischen Mythologie, während sich im Weltlichen die Beziehung von Mara zu ihrer Mutter klärt und Mara zugleich lernt, sich selbst besser zu definieren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mara und der Feuerbringer&amp;rdquo; ist nicht nur eine Tour durch die nordische Mythologie und wie sie sich in unserer heutigen Welt wiederspiegelt, sondern auch eine Comig-of-Age Geschichte, bunt und leicht anarchisch erzählt, wie man es von Tommy Krappweis erwarten kann.
Nicht nur für Jugendliche eine wunderbare Erzählung.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Charles Stross &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/gp/kindle/series/B00WKNMLD4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Merchant Princes&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;rdquo; series of six books is another &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliders&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Sliders&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;rdquo; type of story, with the usual Stross-like twist.
The story follows Miriam Beckstein, a woman who thinks she is a tech journalist.
Miriam falls off a chair while looking at a strange pattern, and finds herself in a medival parallel earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/gp/kindle/series/B00WKNMLD4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2021/07/merchant-princes.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/gp/kindle/series/B00WKNMLD4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Merchant Princes Omnibus&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;quot;, Charles Stross&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the course of the story, Miriam learns that she is actually from this parallel earth, and really is the Countess Helge Thorold-Hjorth in the kingdom of Gruinmarkt, which sits in the place of her world lines Boston.
Her relatives and the other members of the six clans have the unique ability of walking between worlds, which they apparently abuse to work as uncatchable drug and money couriers in our world.
World walking involves looking at a specific pattern, which seems to activate a heritable genetic trait in their brains that make them shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the course of the story we learn a lot about this ability:
The pattern seems to control the linked universes, the ability to walk between worlds seems to be bioengineered into the clans, but the how, who and when are unknown.
There seem to be more parallel worlds, which open up as the story unfolds, and also the mythical &amp;ldquo;lost clan&amp;rdquo; is found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things are becoming really complicated as the world of the lost clan, &amp;ldquo;New Britain&amp;rdquo;&amp;quot;, is discovered.
Miriam flees to this world, which is technologically somewhere in the 1920, and fuels a communist, anti-monarchist revolution by importing gold and ideas into this world.
Meanwhile, the clans activities on our world are becoming known to the US government, which desperately wants to get hold of worldwalkers to understand and duplicate their abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fourth world is being discovered, in which a technologically advanced humanity died out for unknown reasons, and which currently is in the grips of an ice-age.
And in a bit of foreshadowing, a fifth world is being discovered, in which earth is gone, and something else is found instead that resembles a black hole surrounded by unidentified energetic flares.
While the clan struggles with an infight between the conservative and progressive factions, the US government finds a way to world-walk into Gruinmarkt and systematically nukes this world to secure access to the untapped oil reserves in this parallel universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is continued in another trilogy, &amp;ldquo;Empire Games&amp;rdquo;, which is set 17 years later.
The conflicts started in the original series are being played out further, and the mysterious black hole from the fifth world is being activated by accident.
The final part of this trilogy will be published this year, End of September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Merchant Princes&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Empire Games&amp;rdquo; writing and storytelling is everything you would expect from Stross, so time and money well spent.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/Outland-Dennis-Taylor-ebook/dp/B07TP6TKP1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;rdquo; is the first book by Dennis E. Taylor, preceding the Bobiverse and also &amp;ldquo;The Singularity Trap&amp;rdquo;.
It is a &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliders&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Sliders&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;rdquo; storyline, much like &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2016/02/28/fertig-gelesen-the-long-earth.html&#34;&gt;Pratchett&amp;rsquo;s and Baxter&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Long Earth&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;

, in which our heroes discover a parallel dimension with a seemingly uninhabited earth, and then need to colonize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/Outland-Dennis-Taylor-ebook/dp/B07TP6TKP1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/Outland-Dennis-Taylor-ebook/dp/B07TP6TKP1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;

, Dennis E. Taylor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dennis E. Taylor is a computer programmer writing Scifi, and had problems finding a publishher for his debut novel, &amp;ldquo;Outland&amp;rdquo;, in 2015, so he self-published.
The story was intended as the introduction to a series of books, &amp;ldquo;World Lines&amp;rdquo;.
The original novel was withdrawn in 2018, extensively reworked, and re-publshed in 2019 as a standalone book, which is the version linked in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story follows an ensemble cast of students that through a failed physics experiment manage to open a dimensional portal into a parallel earth, which differs from this earth mostly in that it is seemingly uninhabited.
While the students come up with schemes to get rich quick by mining gold in the parallel earth and somehow selling it locally, a global catastrophe strikes:
The Yellowstone Supervolcano activates, covering most of the United States in ashfall and changing climate globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our students now use the portal to evacuate a number of people to start a colony in the wilderness of their parallel earth.
But bootstrapping human civilization from basically nothing with contemporary humans seems to be harder and more dangerous than anybody thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original book showcased early Dennis E. Taylor, but unpolished. The nerd humor and the the writing style were already somewhat there, but the characters were flat and a lot of things were still raw.
The rewrite fixes this, and also makes the book more standalone, while still letting the door open to optional sequels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/Outland-Dennis-Taylor-ebook/dp/B07TP6TKP1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;rdquo; by Dennis E. Taylor, EUR 4.39, also on Kinde unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gregory Hollister, ein reicher Investor, ist verstorben. Angeblich hat er noch eine große Menge Geld, und dieses ist in Bitcoin angelegt und irgendwo versteckt. Wo genau, ist unklar, und so bekommt der Finanzdetektiv Ed Dante von Hollisters Schwester den Auftrag, den verschwundenen Schatz zu identifizieren und aufzuspüren. Dante setzt dabei aus Versehen ein auf dem Computer von Hollister installiertes Script in Gang, das eine weltweite Schatzsuche inszeniert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doch es stellt sich heraus, daß die Geschichte um das Ableben von Hollister weitaus komplizierter ist, denn Hollister hat auch noch eine andere, wesentlich kontrolliertere Cryptowährung ins Leben gerufen und am Ende ist alles ein Racheplot in einem Racheplot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gewohnt gute Kost von Hillenbrand. Schnell und spannend durchzulesen, flott inszeniert und aktuelle Themen aufgreifend. Ich habe mich gut unterhalten gefühlt.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another Monte-Cristo-themed book, Tom Reiss&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/dp/B008QYTJZO&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Black Count&lt;/a&gt;

 nicely complements the german sci-fi novel &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/06/05/fertig-gelesen-montecrypto.html&#34;&gt;Montecrypto&lt;/a&gt;

 by Tom Hillenbrand. It is a biography of the father of the French write Alexandere Dumas, Thomas-Alexandre Dumas Davy de la Pailleterie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/dp/B008QYTJZO&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/dp/B008QYTJZO&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Black Count&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;quot;, by Tom Reiss.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexandre Dumas, the author of &amp;ldquo;The Three Musketeers&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;The Count of Monte Cristo&amp;rdquo; and many other books, is one of the most read French authors. He had it easy coming up with stories, because his father had one of the most unusual and wildest lives imaginable. Dumas was, in a way, telling episodes from his fathers adventures, toned down to become more believable, in some of his stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas-Alexandre was born on the French colony island Saint-Domingue (now Hawaii). His father was the French Marquis Alexandre Antoine Davy de la Pailletterie. His mother Marie-Cessette Dumas, an enslaved woman of &amp;ldquo;Afro-Caribbean&amp;rdquo; ancestry,  which means that she or her ancestors were enslaved somewhere in Africa and forcibly brought to the Island. Not much is known about her actual origin or history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His father, very broke, returned to France, where Thomas-Alexandre was legally freed: in France, slavery was prohibited since 1315, in the colonies not so much. He was educated in a military school and then joined the army as a young man. He also started to use his mothers name after he fell out with his father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dumas entered the military at the age of 24 as a private, but quickly rose in rank. This was not only due to his bodily fitness, his incredible fighting skills and his immense organisational talent, but also due to the wealth of opportunities that the upheaval of the French Revolution of 1789 offered, 3 years into his military career. He held the rank of a General-in-Chief over the 53.000 troops of the French Army in the Alps, at the age of 31. Among his soldiers, he was known for upholding the ideals of the French revolution, Liberty and Equality, and the ideals of Humanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He served under the orders of the commander-in-chief General Napoleon Bonaparte in Milan in 1796, clashing with him over plundering and expropriation policies. He also fought with Napoleon&amp;rsquo;s aide-de-camp over similar matters of fairness and courage in battle. Despite that, he joined Napoleon&amp;rsquo;s Egyptian expedition in 1798, and became the cavalry commander of the French Army of the Orient. The conditions of the march from Alexandria to Cairo were harsh, and Dumas discussed with other french generals if they would refuse to march past Cairo. Napoleon later learned of that meeting, accused Dumas of treason and forced him to return to France on an unsound vessel. The ship sank slowly during the trip, and was forced aground in a storm near Taranto in Naples. Naples Cardinal Fabrizio Ruffo imprisoned Dumas and his fellow travellers for two years. In jail, Dumas was permanently injured due to infection and malnourishment. He died in 1806, five years after his release, from stomach cancer, at which time his son Alexandre Dumas was 4 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Thomas-Alexandre Dumas story easily has sufficient material for several of the stories his son wrote, and his son in fact used parts of his fathers biography in several of his stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Reiss&amp;rsquo; well researched book the life and exploits of this colorful hero of the French Revolution were almost forgotten. Reiss&amp;rsquo; storytelling brings us back the story of Dumas, who lived through one of the most exciting parts of French history.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ian Lance Taylor is the author of a UUCP program that I have been using for a long time to connect to other USENET systems, long before I had access to the actual Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UUCP queues up jobs for remote execution, dials other computers with a moden, exchanges the contents of the queued up work, and after disconnect executes the jobs. The jobs are mostly invocation of &amp;ldquo;rmail&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;rnews&amp;rdquo; programs for the exchange of mail and USENET news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taylors version of UUCP had large number of protocol and interface improvement that made it hugely superior, and that made working with &amp;ldquo;high speed modems&amp;rdquo; viable in the first place. It was the backbone of my network connectivity, 30 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taylor also wrote &amp;ldquo;a book&amp;rdquo; about program linkers in 2007, in the form of a long series of blog posts. In it, he explains what happens to a program after the compiler emits an object file, and before the program actually starts to run. That is, he describes how to the object file, system libraries and runtime become one thing that actually is capable of starting up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is deeply nerdy content, and also quite interesting, because it is widely underdocumented. Taylor&amp;rsquo;s series is key to making the obscure but vital topic better understandable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a book, but a series of blog posts. Fortunately, there is an &lt;a href=&#34;https://lwn.net/Articles/276782/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;index page&lt;/a&gt;

 made available by LWN. The parent article, on the Gold linker, is also &lt;a href=&#34;https://lwn.net/Articles/274859/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;at LWN&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/Needle-Book-Gateway-Essentials-English-ebook/dp/B005K8H1QS/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Needle&lt;/a&gt;

 and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/Through-Eye-Needle-Gateway-Essentials-ebook/dp/B005OAHE7I&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Through the Eye of a Needle&lt;/a&gt;

 are books by Hal Clement. Hal Clement was a Hard Sci-Fi author born in 1922, and &amp;ldquo;Needle&amp;rdquo; was written in 1950 as his first book, for Campbell, no less, and sold to Doubleday. The followup was produced almost 30 years later, in 1978.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/Needle-Book-Gateway-Essentials-English-ebook/dp/B005K8H1QS&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/Needle-Book-Gateway-Essentials-English-ebook/dp/B005K8H1QS&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Needle&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story begins with two spaceships crashing into planet earth, some time in the 1950&amp;rsquo;s idea of a future, close to an island in the Pacific ocean. Both ships are mostly destroyed in the crash, but the inhabitants survive: A criminal, and a kind of headhunter/policeman. They are part of formless species that has much smaller cells than humans and that need a host from normal sized cells with which they live in symbiosis - at least those of the species that are not criminals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hunter enters the body of Bob Kincaid, a post-puberty schoolboy that parties at the beach because it&amp;rsquo;s the end of the summer vacation. The Hunter needs time to orient himself in Bob, establish communication, and find of his current situation, at which point Bob is already firmly abroad on the American continent, in School. He now needs to find a way to get Bob back to the island, and then find the Criminal who may hide in anybody on that island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We follow Bob and his symbiont through the case, exploring the life on the island, in a weird mix of Sci-Fi, Whodunnit and YA island life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second part, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/Through-Eye-Needle-Gateway-Essentials-ebook/dp/B005OAHE7I&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Through the Eye of a Needle&lt;/a&gt;

, Hal Clement returns to his characters. Bob has fallen ill, which should be impossible with the Hunter symbiont living in him, and it appears that he&amp;rsquo;s showing some kind of reaction to the presence of the Hunter himself. Help is needed from specialists of the Hunters people, but because the Hunter&amp;rsquo;s ship was destroyed in the crash that seems to be impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two old school hard Sci-Fi books, that, looking past the outdated role-models, are still interesting YA reads and have aged quite okay.&lt;/p&gt;

 by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/joxeankoret&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Jaxeon Koret&lt;/a&gt;

 and Elias Bachaalany is part book, part a research report, detailing the findings of Jaxeon Koret and Elias Bachaalany in how Antivirus programs work, try to protect themselves and can be attacked and exploited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/Antivirus-Hackers-Handbook-English-ebook/dp/B014MJ6AKS/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;

&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book assumes that you have some basic knowledge how compilers produce programs, what assembler looks like and how to map that on program statements in the code you write, and have access to IDA Pro free edition, Ghidra, Hopper or some other reverse engineering and analysis tool. We are then guided through the authors journey of discovery, analyzing the cores and plugin systems of various Antivirus products, how they work, how they detect viruses, how they update themselves, and how they try to protect themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antivirus systems are terribly large and attractive targets when trying to exploit individual machines or even fleets of machines: They try to scan and understand all kinds of file formats, run analysis often in privileged mode and with system protections turned off, and they are usually installed uniformly on a large fleet of machines in corporates, as mandatory pieces of software. These days they also increasingly have cloud components they upload data to, well suited to mask exfiltration traffic. When trying to attack and subvert corporate targets, they are the ideal platform for an attacker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the authors take us on that journey, at a level of intricate detail, but also always keeping the larger goal in sight. After reading this book one is looking at corporate security software differently, questioning if it is actually making things more secure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Fri, 14 May 2021 15:55:01 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/05/14/fertig-gelesen-the-witcher.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, Netflix&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.netflix.com/nl-en/title/80189685&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Witcher&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;rdquo; was weird, and could not decide what it wanted to be: A &amp;ldquo;Hercules Legenday Journey&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo;-like half-comedy, half-camp series, or something else, darker and denser, with more story and background. It hinted at a better story, better told, that did not make it into the final product, and died somewhere between the scriptwriting and the cutting table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigating, I got myself the equivalent of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/Witcher-Boxed-Set-Destiny-Contempt/dp/1473232279&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Witcher Boxed Set&lt;/a&gt;

 on the Kindle and started reading. And indeed, just as with &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/04/07/fertig-gelesen-conan-the-barbarian.html&#34;&gt;Conan, the Barbarian&lt;/a&gt;

, the book is nothing like the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get indeed a dense and increasingly dark story, the story of Geralt and Jennifer, both remnants from a time gone by, and Ciri, the product of an age-old arrangement of breeding and selection, gone wrong in the last few steps, all of them fighting for freedom of will and their choice in life, and ultimately failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reading order is  &amp;ldquo;The Last Wish&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Sword of Destiny&amp;rdquo;, (&amp;ldquo;Season of Storms&amp;rdquo;, optional), &amp;ldquo;Blood of Elves&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Time of Contempt&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Baptism of Fire&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Tower of the Swallow&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The Lady of the Lake&amp;rdquo;. And indeed, the story is good, the Netflix series is shallow and has very little to do with the books. Also, Sapkowsky pulls off a surprisingly large and mean number of storytelling trickery.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The story of &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/04/07/fertig-gelesen-heavens-river.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Heaven&amp;rsquo;s River&lt;/a&gt;

, stranding in and then exploring an alien megastructure, is one that has been written before: In &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/Ringworld-English-Larry-Niven-ebook/dp/B01513ZIL6&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Niven&amp;rsquo;s Ringworld&lt;/a&gt;

. John Varley&amp;rsquo;s take on this, very seventies, is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/Titan-Gaia-Book-1-English-ebook/dp/B009KUXCBK&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;

, Wizard and Daemon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cirocco Jones is the Commander of the Earth science ship Ringmaster, and is right now approaching the orbit of Saturn, where she and her crew discover a new moon. As they approach the moon, they realize it&amp;rsquo;s a Stanford Torus like space habitat. Trying to find a way to dock, they come close and are being picked up by a giant tentacle-like arm, and dragged into the station while their ship is being destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Cirocco wakes up, literally naked and hairless, without any resouces by the metal parts that are the remains of her spacesuit, she realizes that months have elapsed since the collision. She sets out to orient herself in the strange, but extremely habitable world inside the torus, trying to find her crewmates. She manages to find them, and realizes they, like herself, have been changed in the months that they have spend somewhere in the interior of the space station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They learn that the station is indeed a living being, older than time itself, and it is falling apart as the central intelligence is dying and the twelve subintelligences in the torus are fighting amongst themselves for control. Exploring the Flora and Fauna, it becomes obvious that all life in Gaia is constructed and preprogrammed, and at least sometimes under control of the central intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cirocco, and her surviving shipmates, are trying to reach the centre, climbing up one of the giant, kilometres thick cables that hold the torus together. On their way they learn that some of them have been changed beyond the point of sanity, and fighting starts. Cirocco manages to get to the center, and is offered to be Gaia&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Wizard&amp;rdquo;, her repair agent in torus world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the further books, this is expanded - Gaia establishes herself as a nation in the Solar system, opening a Consulate and offering medical miracle cures to humans that make the trip to Saturn and Gaia. It becomes clear that Gaia is terminally old, going slowly insane by age and boredom. Cirocco and Gaia fall out, and go to war with each other, Cirocco no longer being the &amp;ldquo;Wizard&amp;rdquo;, but the &amp;ldquo;Daemon&amp;rdquo;. During these events, Gaby, Ciroccos shipmate and later partner, is being killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story then turns into more of a Zombie movie, in which a completely crazed Gaia goes to war on the humans, and the creatures of her that managed to emancipate themselves from her waning control. It comes to light that Gaia recorded the personalities of the captured Ringmaster crew, and that Gaby&amp;rsquo;s mentral recording has become some kind of agent in the hardware that represents the actual Gaia in the center of the Titan ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a final confrontation, Cirocco raises an army from the ring inhabitants loyal to her, conquers Gaia&amp;rsquo;s forces, and manages to distract her sufficiently so that Gaby can take over the rings central hardware and bring the rebellious subsystems under her control. Gaby offers Cirocco to become a Wizard again, but Cirocco chooses adventure instead&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story has the classic shape of this particular Sci-Fi trope, and is being echo&amp;rsquo;ed in part in multiple ways in Heaven&amp;rsquo;s River, but is also very typical in its 70-ies sex-and-drugs laden storytelling. It has aged well enough to be enjoyable to read again, but it is too long to read in one uninterrupted go, and also has lengths in the later parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
