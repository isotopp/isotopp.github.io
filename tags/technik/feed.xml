      <description>&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/isotopp/status/1450739310546886657&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;wrote on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;

 something about the term &amp;ldquo;Metaverse&amp;rdquo;.
That led to a contact with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/michacarl&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Michael Carl&lt;/a&gt;

, who wanted to make an episode for his &lt;a href=&#34;https://carls-zukunft.de/folge-58-how-to-build-a-metaversum-in-three-simple-steps/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Podcast&lt;/a&gt;

 with me.
My &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_OIl_bcrjVczLQrMrVnt5IoYbitp1504mb2GbQK0EM4/edit#heading=h.wbe6wnc7fg59&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;german notes and talk prep&lt;/a&gt;

 are now also available here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;metaverse&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#metaverse&#34;&gt;
	Metaverse
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;Metaverse&amp;rdquo; was initially coined by Neal Stephenson in 1992, but in the context of the current discussion it was defined as in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Metaverse: What It Is, Where to Find it, Who Will Build It, and Fortnite&lt;/a&gt;

 by Matthew Ball. Ball later &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.matthewball.vc/the-metaverse&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;wrote a lot more about the same&lt;/a&gt;

, and that led to the current Valley Hype around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are starting with games, who no longer are what they started out as, but somehow transcended:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fortnite by Epic Games, which now also hosts non-Fortnite events,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roblox, a platform to make and host low-end games, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minecraft in the Java and Bedrock editions, to show how both fail differently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fortnite&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#fortnite&#34;&gt;
	Fortnite
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortnite originally was a Battle Royale game, but is now also a platform that can host events. You can also buy skins for your characters or items, often in a partnership with other IP, for example Marvel/DC super heroes.
People gave concerts in there, or hosting other events.
Epic likes to do this, openly, because it establishes Fortnite with people who are not originally interested in Battle Royale or part of gaming culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epic Games also makes the Unreal Engine, and the associated pipelines for creating and editing in-game assets, hosts a market to sell these things, and is building a living infrastructure to produce games, and market them.
They are in a way the invisible back-cover of many games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;roblox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#roblox&#34;&gt;
	Roblox
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, but way more casual, Roblox operates a platform to create, host and market low-end games, &amp;ldquo;making games as a game&amp;rdquo;, and matching this, they also have assets, and an asset and game marketing outlet.
Roblox is mostly a thing with young and very young people, and vastly underrated with older people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;minecraft-in-two-flavors&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#minecraft-in-two-flavors&#34;&gt;
	Minecraft in two flavors
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minecraft is a classic: The original game is written in Java, and meanwhile completely replaceable with third party components. There are alternative clients, alternative servers, and alternative assets.
The game is bad: It is a sandbox without much story, an ill-defined goal and primitive graphics, the original servers are slow and buggy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the graphics are simple enough that even old potato computers can render it.
It is written in Java, which can be easily reversed and extended without cooperation from the vendor.
And thus there is an extremely rich community of modders, server and client plugins, and many other extensions.
As such, Minecraft is a gateway drug into Java programming with young people, because it has unlimited potential for self-motivation and initiates undirected and unprompted learning in many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of that leads to monetization that the current owner, Microsoft, can hook on.
As an IP asset, Minecraft Java is an utter failure, because after the initial purchase Microsoft is no longer part of the value chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why there is &amp;ldquo;Minecraft Bedrock Edition&amp;rdquo;, more performant, better designed and from the ground up with an asset marketplace.
You can buy Bedrock extensions in that marketplace, and only there.
As a maker of extensions, you will have to license IP from Microsoft, and pay percentages, as a customer anyway.
With gamers, it is not very popular, sterile, and without its own subculture.
Compared to the Java Edition, an even bigger failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bedrock model is comparable to the Apple Developer mode, but smaller in scope:
You can&amp;rsquo;t seriously develop for Apple machines without having an Apple-ID, a developer license, support for Apple Cloud for handover, and without leaving percentages to the Apple Store.
Bedrock copies that model, but not as a Computer-Tablet ecosystem, only as a game, and that did not take off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;metaverse-a-first-definition&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#metaverse-a-first-definition&#34;&gt;
	Metaverse: A first definition.
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition of &amp;ldquo;Metaverse&amp;rdquo; is hence less 3D goggles, and more &amp;ldquo;Integration of the gaming industry with the value chain of the entertainment industry for an open digital asset market&amp;rdquo;.
Or more open: siphoning off percentages along the gaming value chain during production, marketing and usage, and improving the value of gaming assets by partnering with entertainment properties and using their IP in gaming contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective is to get more lifetime consumer budget out of a person, without bothering them too much by investing actual time.
We want to extend the scope of &amp;ldquo;sellable media&amp;rdquo; in the widest sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;attention-and-time-budgets&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#attention-and-time-budgets&#34;&gt;
	Attention and time budgets
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have monetary limits, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_and_discretionary_income&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;the consumption part of disposable income&lt;/a&gt;

.
They also have time limits, an attention budget.
Both are convertible, but that is media dependent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming a useful lifetime of 60 years for media consumption, during that time I could read for example one book per week, for a total of 40 books per year.
In a total lifetime, that are 2400 books, at - say - 30 Euros each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With AAA games, one can do around 4-6 of them per year, 240-300 in a lifetime, at a value of around 60 Euros each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a total lifetime value of around 70k Euro in books, or 20k Euro in games per person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see that games are too cheap compared to their production cost, but a higher price than 60 Euro is unrealistic even for AAA titles.
That is one reason why each and every game has additional ways of spending money after purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general with both media types, there is a lot of my lifetime attention span bound for comparatively little money:
We need to up the burn rate.
Books, movies and especially AAA games are much too valuable per time and their consume binds too much attention for the business to scale up.
We need a different way to extract money that does not bind as many minutes of person-lifetime and attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is critically important, because there is also a lot of free content which competes for attention with our paid for assets, and which often is &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo; to bind time which we then cannot monetize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-sidebar-death-and-inheritances&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#a-sidebar-death-and-inheritances&#34;&gt;
	A sidebar: death and inheritances
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an aging population there is the sidebar &amp;ldquo;boomers die, their children inherit&amp;rdquo;.
For example, right now I have around 600 Steam titles, and around 1000 Kindle books.
When I die this represents multiple 10k Euro of value.
How can my son inherit this?
Politics has no answers, and the vendors say &amp;ldquo;he won&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rdquo;.
I can only leave my Steam login to my son, and crack the DRM of my Kindle titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economically, Kindle and Steam inheritances are largely irrelevant, or would be even be positive, and it is unclear why vendors are blocking this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I am inheriting a villa at the lake, I can go in, open the veranda, walk down through the park to the shore and enjoy the asset within minutes.
It does not take much time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inheriting my Kindle and Steam library, my son will need to invest a lot of time to enjoy that:
With 1200 books that will bind 30 years of lifetime,  and with an inheritance of 1000 games there will be titles from 2002 that look like drawn with crayons today.
I am inheriting &amp;ldquo;Skyrim&amp;rdquo;, but I will have to purchase the &amp;ldquo;VR&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Remastered&amp;rdquo; editions of that myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see immediately that this will hardly lead to a loss in revenue for vendors, in some cases it is more like a kind of advertisement, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;assets-high-budget-little-time&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#assets-high-budget-little-time&#34;&gt;
	Assets: high budget, little time
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even today, games offer loot boxes, pay-to-win and pay-to-skip purchases, and they sell cosmetics. Unlike the first three, the last one is hardly controversial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay-to-Win: to finish the game successfully you have to buy equipment with real money. Ideally this becomes apparent only of tou already are invested in the game emotionally and with lifetime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay-to-Skip: gameplay is often interrupted with annoying delays in which you can&amp;rsquo;t play, except you purchase immediate continuations with real money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lootboxes: The game sells containers with &amp;ldquo;random&amp;rdquo; in-game assets to you, some of which are very important in the context of the game. The actual game is just a wrapper for an addictive (and usually rigged) game of chance. The practice is already illegal as unregulated gambling in several EU countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to this, cosmetics are widely accepted: These are assets that change the way the character or their equipment looks like, without affecting gameplay. Also, virtual houses and house furnishings that have no effect on gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in &amp;ldquo;Elder Scrolls Online&amp;rdquo; as a player you can get easily and early in-game houses which are spectacularly located, and have a lot of empty space for decorations.
Furnishings to decorate the house can be gotten as trophies in-game, but every day things can only be gotten by using real money and purchase from the shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has many desirable properties for the vendor:
The player can spend a lot of money (without limits!) in-game, and hardly has to invest time or attention to make use of these assets.
We are no longer revenue-bound by the players&amp;rsquo; attention budget.
This is a much better thing to sell than books, films or the games themselves.
The game only provides context and reason for the cosmetics to exist, and defines their visuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epic-games&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#epic-games&#34;&gt;
	Epic Games
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is precisely the operating model of Epic Games:
With the Unreal Engine the company owns a platform for the fast and efficient design and rendering of really good-looking games.
This also includes the tooling for making in-game assets, but also a market to sell these to other game developers.
With the Epic Launcher and the integrated shop this is also a platform for game sales, and to collect meta and usage data for Epic, which again (for money) are sold back to the developer as analytics.
Epic operates a payment system, which pipes money from the customer to the developer, not only for games, but also for extensions, DLC and in-game purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Fortnite, Epic has their own game, which at the same time can also sell 3D assets to players as equipment, cosmetics and other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortnite is a special kind of game - player vs. player, battle royal - players play against each other and last man standing wins the round.
This kind of game is not interesting for all target demographics, but the engine of Fortnite is flexible and can be repurposed.
This enables other use-cases, among them also as a &amp;ldquo;virtual event platform&amp;rdquo;, which also keeps the interest up through media tie-ins and licensed IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interpretation of &amp;ldquo;The Metaverse&amp;rdquo; as a value chain for digital assets, specifically 3D assets, is too short-sighted:
As an ecosystem with a controlled number of large market operators and a very large numbers of content creators and customers the foundations will look better and have better longevity.
It is entirely possible to allow third parties to operate in this &amp;ldquo;virtual world&amp;rdquo;, trade with each other, especially if the market operators at all times get a tiny share from each transaction.
This is the idea of the &amp;ldquo;Microsoft tax&amp;rdquo;, revitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;players-in-this-market&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#players-in-this-market&#34;&gt;
	Players in this market
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different parties have different starting positions and strengths:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Epic Games/Fortnite - weak in IP, but some original IP, even if niche. Unreal Engine and other things on the &amp;ldquo;games invisible back-cover&amp;rdquo; as a big strength.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roblox - original IP, very young customers, grooms them into future customers, wait 10 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft - Minecraft, MS Store et al., too enterprise for success? But Halo, MSFS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple (sic!) - no IP, but platform/chain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disney (sic!) - only IP, but weak marketing outside of films/merchandise. Knows the game very well in the real world: Imagine Disneyland principles applied to a Metaverse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook - wants in at all costs, &amp;ldquo;pivot our enterprise&amp;rdquo;: If &amp;ldquo;social&amp;rdquo; of the future is &amp;ldquo;here&amp;rdquo;, we need to be &amp;ldquo;here&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google - all of this is a reason why Stadia still exists, despite being a flop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon - this is where the gaming strategy of Amazon is anchored. Amazon would like to be the AWS of the gaming world, instead of Epic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tech-maturity-cycle-and-standards&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#tech-maturity-cycle-and-standards&#34;&gt;
	Tech Maturity Cycle and standards
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Cynefin&lt;/a&gt;

 as a Market Maturity Model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are in the chaotic phase of market maturity:
Nobody has a business model for this.
It is unclear what the market will look like, what the standards are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the landgrab phase, building market share in a new and emerging market.
Interop is secondary, because the future standards are not yet visible.
Player try to differentiate themselves with features, also to find out which features matter.
All players grow in a growing market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as a business model and stable feature lists exists and there is a system for money extraction the market can consolidate.
As always, 3-5 companies will dominate the market, which is dropping out of hypergrowth.
The dominating companies acknowledge their respective existence and roles, and compete semi-cooperatively:
It is more important to erect barriers to entry for disruptors than to destroy the existing competition, and hence there will be complex, hard to implement standards with expensive compliance tests.
This will then, against all wishes, lead to interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;metaverse-revised-definition&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#metaverse-revised-definition&#34;&gt;
	Metaverse, revised definition
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we get:
The Metaverse is an integration of the gaming industry with the entertainment industry, and the merging of their value chains, optionally extracting a transactional tax at any point of the value chain.
The objective is to monetize the lifetime intellectual consumption budget of any person, and extending the market of products relevant to that person, decoupling spend from attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A main result is that books, films and games bind too much time to consume and limit spend.
3D assets are a better sale binding for less time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also the backdrop to read &amp;ldquo;Epic vs. Apple and Google&amp;rdquo; properly:
This is about opening the monopolistic markets these companies have for their hardware products, and allow other companies to monetize their walled gardens with their own offerings directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The german outlook is dreary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lacking highspeed, low latency infrastructure for gaming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lacking a German company with identity platforms (&amp;ldquo;Login with x&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lacking resources and companies with 3D asset tooling, production, marketplaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lacking German film/tv/literature IP that can be integrated with any of this, especially on a global scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;German companies and culture looks inward, into the own country, not towards a global cultural base.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare with Korea: Korean production chains in K-Pop; Korean &amp;ldquo;cultural technology&amp;rdquo; that integrated other cultures styles and art and integrates it into K-Pop; production and grooming pipelines for stars and starlets; emerging similar chains for IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison, Germany counts as unarmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;toxic-dystopic-interpretation&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#toxic-dystopic-interpretation&#34;&gt;
	Toxic-dystopic interpretation
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Property&amp;rdquo; in a simulated reality looks like property, but is virtual and can be duplicated easily.
Virtualization removes resource constraints in production, but &amp;ldquo;value&amp;rdquo; is only created by uniqueness in consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The platform operators and &amp;ldquo;tax&amp;rdquo; authorities have full market transparency and can meter the time spent and consumption habits of everybody.
They know what you look at and listen to, what you are using, which styles you like and can sell this data for money to creators. They will also sell access to you to creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HHOS: in the future at birth of child, you will first have to decide which corporate tribe it joins and then find a name compliant with that tribes rules. Switching between tribes is as complicated as an emigration to or from North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A central building block is also DRM, here under the marketing name of &amp;ldquo;NFT&amp;rdquo;. NFT is the blockchain word for DRM, only with added destruction of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unique things are only possible with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;locking the machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TPM,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in-game only licensed assets and mods usable, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NFT Laser Eyes crypto bullshit that burns the planet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context also the current engagement of Epic in the NFT bull.
Proper standards will be important, and &amp;ldquo;identity&amp;rdquo; is central for &amp;ldquo;property&amp;rdquo;.
This does not need blockchain, and will work better without - the platforms are central anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend, commenting further:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to bind these people into this universe (&amp;ldquo;Hyperinclusion&amp;rdquo;).
They buy in the metaverses store, date their partners in metaverse locations, watch ads for products only available in the metaverse, and can hardly formulate metaverse critical thinking.
There is no public space anymore, everything is part of the gated community (cf loss of the almende).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be competition between a small number of metaverses, but within one metaverse there is only managed competition.
That is, the metaverse monopolizes a life in its totality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a lot like mining towns in the US in the late 19th century.
The shop was owned by the mine, the priest was employed by the mine, and the sheriff and mayor were mine employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effectively the FB strategy is to make their social media monopoly permanent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads us to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;currency&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#currency&#34;&gt;
	Currency
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrencies have demonstrated to large players that money creation is now &amp;ldquo;up for grabs&amp;rdquo;.
A metaverse is a very good environment to realize that &amp;ldquo;en passant&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, watch the Epic engagement in crypto for details.
This is problematic:
Metaverse and production in it takes resources from the real world, but does not produce value for the real world.
The real world is getting poorer, but that is where we live.
What does that mean long term for the creation of value and money?&lt;/p&gt;

: Original Metaverse Article&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Media side:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time Netflix launched its streaming service, much of Hollywood knew that the future of television was online (IP TV had been deployed in the late 1999s). The challenge was timing and how to package such a service (it took another 10 years for Hollywood to accept all of their channels, genres and content needs to be collapsed into a single app/brand).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ball writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Metaverse, we think, will be &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persistent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synchronous and live.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be without any cap to concurrent users, while also providing each user with an individual sense of “presence”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be a fully functioning economy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be an experience that spans both the digital and physical worlds, private and public networks/experiences, and open and closed platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offer unprecedented interoperability of data, digital items/assets, content, and so on across each of these experiences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be populated by “content” and “experiences” created and operated by an incredibly wide range of contributors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Metaverse is not…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A “virtual world”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A “virtual space”  (2nd life)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Virtual reality”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A “digital and virtual economy”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &amp;ldquo;game&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A “virtual theme park or Disneyland”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A “new app store”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A “new UGC platform”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, of course, nonsense, it will be all of these things, &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt;.
This is Valley Hype to make the Next Internet sellable, and to have a common tale to tell.
But in the end this is all about the things it is supposedly NOT.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep up engagement and interest.
A problem for any MMO:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People don&amp;rsquo;t live in the metaverse, the live here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Primary consumption is casual, not high-end gamer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That is the weakness of the concept, esp Facebook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can only become a Metaverse if it becomes a permanent place.
That&amp;rsquo;s still a long road to travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My VR goggles are sitting around, idle (sold the Oculus because mandatory FB account).
That is, because &amp;ldquo;entering VR&amp;rdquo; is an act (set things up, calibrate), and the goggles isolate (when I put them on, I am &amp;ldquo;gone&amp;rdquo;), and because it is used only by very few games.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crypto bullshit with a few good ideas, but also illusions/lies about what will happen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;1/5 of FB now working on AR&amp;rdquo;, FB looks at Metaverse as &amp;ldquo;Oculus&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;VR&amp;rdquo;. That&amp;rsquo;s dangerous tunnel vision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The &amp;ldquo;Metaverse&amp;rdquo; is a virtual space created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality, AR &amp;amp; the Internet: Our current 2D search based version of the Internet is giving way to a fully 3D immersive reality&amp;rdquo;: bullshit, unless consumption becomes casual. 3D Assets in Pancake Games are easier to sell &amp;ldquo;Cosmetics&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Metaverse is always “on” &amp;amp; is beyond the control of any individual. It exists in real time, can host any size audience, has a functioning economy, spans across platforms, provides interoperability for digital assets, &amp;amp; consists of the content and experiences its users create.&amp;rdquo; That is 2nd 2nd life as a concept, and  &amp;ldquo;3D Shoppingmalls&amp;rdquo; of the early 90ies revived. As a concept not wrong, and at the same time completely wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the Metaverse, the earning power for young creators won’t be limited to the top 1%. There will be an entire new era of young entrepreneurs making a living in virtual worlds, earning real value and steady income quicker than ever imagined.&amp;rdquo; LOL. Mainly this is about a microsoft tax, that will siphon off money from creators along the way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Creators who were once limited in their ability by technological constraints, lack of capital, time, or creativity, now have everything that is needed. What happens when physical objects are dematerialized? All formerly scarce materials become abundant.&amp;rdquo; LOL. DRM all the way is a requirement to make this work. Also, the permanent promise of creators paradise, when this is really about monopolization of the value chain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital twins will act as &amp;ldquo;foundations of the metaverse&amp;rdquo; and allow people to move between real and virtual spaces&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again &amp;ldquo;2nd 2nd Life&amp;rdquo;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Skeumorphism&lt;/a&gt;

 is what we do with new tech that does not yet have its own design language. The first cars looked like coaches, and the first Apple applications mimicked Rolodexes and Moleskines. &amp;ldquo;Digital Twins&amp;rdquo; is the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core idea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2020, music artist Travis Scott staged a virtual concert inside the game that was attended live by 12.3 million people. It was a global phenomenon that sent the American rapper to the top of all music charts and earned him a reported $20 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read: &amp;ldquo;OMG, somebody has used a children&amp;rsquo;s battle royale to earn money without shooting players, but with traditional media work.&amp;rdquo;, and we are back to &amp;ldquo;all the ideas of 2nd life we know are problematic may still be valid again&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If the metaverse is an equivalent reality that coexists next to the physical reality, there needs to be a connection,&amp;rdquo; said Weir-McCall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does not need that at all. If, then more likely as AR than as 3D models, because connections to the real world is what you lose with 3D VR goggles. Casual is king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;facebook-glasshttpswwwreuterscomtechnologyfacebook-unveils-its-first-smart-glasses-2021-09-09-and-acceptance&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#facebook-glasshttpswwwreuterscomtechnologyfacebook-unveils-its-first-smart-glasses-2021-09-09-and-acceptance&#34;&gt;

 and acceptance
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Goggle were identifiable and their users vilified as glassholes.
Facebook is using Ray Bay to cover that.
There is no technical relationship between Oculus and AR.
This is about hiding the tech in the goggles to make it acceptable, and prevent a Facebook glasshole effect.
Also, AR is more casual than VR.
Fashion also allows easier re-sales of the same item, see also Apple Watch accessories.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s gonna be epic to bring the squid game to the metaverse. Salute to your team! I am a big fan of the TV series. I am super excited to have a chance to participate in this game! LFG!!!&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 20:55:51 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/10/26/metaverse.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ich &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/isotopp/status/1450739310546886657&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;schrieb auf Twitter&lt;/a&gt;

 was zum aktuellen Begriff &amp;ldquo;Metaverse&amp;rdquo;.
Das hat zu einem Kontakt mit &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/michacarl&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Michael Carl&lt;/a&gt;

 geführt, der mich in seinem &lt;a href=&#34;https://carls-zukunft.de/folge-58-how-to-build-a-metaversum-in-three-simple-steps/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Podcast&lt;/a&gt;

 haben wollte.
Meine &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_OIl_bcrjVczLQrMrVnt5IoYbitp1504mb2GbQK0EM4/edit#heading=h.wbe6wnc7fg59&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Gesprächsnotizen und Vorbereitung&lt;/a&gt;

 habe ich nun auch hier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;metaverse&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#metaverse&#34;&gt;
	Metaverse
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Begriff &amp;ldquo;Metaverse&amp;rdquo; stammt ursprünglich von Neal Stephenson, aus dem Jahre 1992, aber er ist im aktuellen Kontext von Matthew Ball in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Metaverse: What It Is, Where to Find it, Who Will Build It, and Fortnite&lt;/a&gt;

 mit Sinn gefüllt worden. Ball hat dann später &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.matthewball.vc/the-metaverse&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;mehr zum Thema&lt;/a&gt;

 geschrieben, und so den aktuellen Silicon Valley Hype erzeugt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Überlegung beginnt mit Spielen, die nicht mehr sind, was sie mal waren, sondern irgendwie mehr geworden sind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fortnite von Epic Games, in der nun auch Nicht-Fortnite-Aktivitäten stattfinden,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roblox, eine Plattform zur spielerischen Generierung von Computerspielen, und&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minecraft in der Java- und der Bedrock-Edition, um zu zeigen, wie beides auf seine Weise unternehmerische Fehlschläge sind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fortnite&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#fortnite&#34;&gt;
	Fortnite
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortnite war mal Battle Royale, aber ist inzwischen auch eine &amp;ldquo;Veranstaltungsplattform&amp;rdquo;, man kann dort Skins kaufen, Partnerschaften mit anderem IP, zum Beispiel Marvel/DC Super Heroes.
Leute haben dort Konzerte gegeben oder andere Veranstaltungen durchgeführt.
Epic unterstützt das, recht offen, weil es Fortnite so auch bei Leuten bekannt macht, die an Battle Royal und Gamer-Kultur nicht primär interessiert sind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epic Games macht auch die Unreal Engine, und die dazu gehörenden Pipelines zum Erstellen und Editieren von digitalen Game-Assets, betreibt einen Markt für diese Dinge und baut auch sonst eine lebendige Infrastruktur zur Spielerzeugung und zur Vermarktung auf.
Gewissermaßen ist dies die unsichtbare &amp;ldquo;Rückseite&amp;rdquo; von Spielen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;roblox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#roblox&#34;&gt;
	Roblox
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ganz ähnlich, aber viel mehr casual betreibt Roblox sowieso eine Plattform zur Erzeugung von Spielen, und macht so Assets, aber auch einen Markt für Assets.
Roblox ist vor allen Dingen bei jungen und sehr jungen Menschen populär, und wird bei älteren Menschen weit unterschätzt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;minecraft-in-zwei-geschmacksrichtungen&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#minecraft-in-zwei-geschmacksrichtungen&#34;&gt;
	Minecraft in zwei Geschmacksrichtungen
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minecraft ist ein Klassiker: Das originale Minecraft ist in Java geschrieben und inzwischen komplett durch Komponenten von Drittherstellern ersetzbar. Es gibt alternative Clients, alternative Server, alternative Assets.
Das Spiel ist schlecht: Es ist eine Sandbox ohne viel Story und ohne Spielziel mit primitiver Grafik, die originalen Server sind langsam und fehlerhaft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aber die Grafik ist simpel, sodass das Spiel auch auf abgelegten Kartoffelcomputern funktioniert.
Es ist alles in Java geschrieben, das sich leicht reversen und dann unkooperativ erweitern lässt, und so gibt es eine reichhaltige Community mit Moddern, Server- und Client-Plugins, und vielen anderen Erweiterungen.
Das macht das Spiel populär und zu einer &amp;ldquo;Einstiegsdroge&amp;rdquo; in die Java-Programmierung bei jungen Menschen, weil es ein unglaubliches Potenzial für Selbstmotivation bietet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nichts davon ist durch den derzeitigen Eigentümer Microsoft monetarisierbar.
Als IP ist Minecraft für Microsoft gescheitert, weil Microsoft nach dem Kauf des Spiels nicht mehr Teil der Verwertungskette ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daher gibt es von Microsoft &amp;ldquo;Minecraft Bedrock Edition&amp;rdquo;, performanter und besser designt, und von Grund auf mit einem Asset-Markt integriert.
Erweiterungen für Bedrock sind im Laden kaufbar, und nur dort.
Man muss als Anbieter IP von Microsoft lizenzieren und dann Prozente zahlen, als Kunde sowieso.
Bei den Spielern ist es deswegen kaum populär, steril und ohne eigene Kultur.
Im Vergleich zu Java Edition noch ein größerer Fehlschlag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das Bedrock-Modell ist vergleichbar mit dem Apple Entwicklermodell, aber kleiner im Scope:
Man kann nicht ernsthaft für Apple entwickeln ohne Apple-ID, Entwickler-Lizenz, Cloud-Nutzung für Handover und Storage und ohne Prozente im Apple Store zu bezahlen.
Bedrock ist danach modelliert, aber halt kein Computer-Tablet-ökosystem, sondern nur ein Spiel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;metaverse-eine-erste-definition&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#metaverse-eine-erste-definition&#34;&gt;
	Metaverse: Eine erste Definition
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die tatsächliche Definition von &amp;ldquo;Metaverse&amp;rdquo; sind also nicht 3D-Brillen, sondern &amp;ldquo;die Integration der Computerspieleindustrie mit der Wertschöpfungskette der Unterhaltungsindustrie für einen offenen, digitalen Assetmarkt&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oder offener: Das Anzapfen der Spieleverwertungskette an jeder Stelle im Produktionsfluß, und das Aufwerten der Spieleverwertungskette durch Integration mit Intellectual Property aus Filmen und Büchern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es geht also darum, aus dem Lebenszeit-Konsum-Budget einer Person mehr Geld herauszuziehen, ohne zu viel Lebenszeit bei dieser Person zu verbrauchen, also um eine Aufweitung von Ausgaben für &amp;ldquo;Medien&amp;rdquo; im aller weitesten Sinne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;budgets-für-aufmerksamkeit-und-geld&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#budgets-f%c3%bcr-aufmerksamkeit-und-geld&#34;&gt;
	Budgets für Aufmerksamkeit und Geld
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Menschen haben Geldlimits für ihre Freizeit, der &lt;a href=&#34;https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verf%C3%BCgbares_Einkommen&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Konsumanteil des verfügbaren Einkommens&lt;/a&gt;

.
Sie haben auch Zeitlimits für ihre Freizeit, ein Budget für Aufmerksamkeit.
Beides ist konvertibel, aber das hängt am Medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nimmt man eine nützliche Lebenszeit, in der ich &amp;ldquo;Lesen&amp;rdquo; kann von 60 Jahren an, und unterstellt man einem fleißigen Leser 40 Bücher (eines pro Woche) im Jahr, dann wird diese Person in ihrem Leben 2400 Bücher lesen, im Wert von sagen wir ~30 Euro pro Stück.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arbeitet man mit Computerspielen der AAA-Klasse, dann schafft man eventuell 4-6 Spiele im Jahr sinnvoll durchzuspielen, also im Leben 240-300 Titel, im Wert von ~60 Euro pro Stück.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das setzt eine Größenordnung von Lebensumsatz pro Person für diese Dinge, also ~70k Euro in Büchern oder 20k Euro in Spielen pro Personenleben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir sehen insbesondere, daß Spiele im Vergleich zu ihrem Produktionsaufwand viel zu billig sind, aber ein höherer Preis als 60 Euro ist auch für einen AAA-Titel nicht durchsetzbar.
Das ist einer der Gründe, warum in jedem einzelnen dieser Spiele weitere Möglichkeiten zum Geldausgeben enthalten sind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generell ist es aber bei beiden Medien so, daß das Geldausgeben im Vergleich zu der aufgewendeten Zeit zu langsam ist:
Die Burnrate muss hoch.
Bücher, aber auch Filme und insbesondere AAA-Titel von Computerspielen sind viel zu werthaltig, und ihr Konsum ist zu aufwendig.
Wir suchen was anderes, bei dem nicht so viele Minuten Lebenszeit pro ausgegebenem Euro aufgewendet werden müsse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist kritisch, weil es ja auch noch viele freie Inhalte gibt, die auch um Aufmerksamkeit buhlen und &amp;ldquo;gut genug&amp;rdquo; sind, um bezahlte Inhalte zu verdrängen.
Sie kosten Minuten Aufmerksamkeit, ohne Geld zu verdienen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nebenschauplatz-sterben-und-erben&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#nebenschauplatz-sterben-und-erben&#34;&gt;
	Nebenschauplatz: Sterben und Erben
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angesichts der alternden Bevölkerung gibt es auch noch den Nebenschauplatz &amp;ldquo;Boomer sterben, Kinder erben&amp;rdquo;.
Ich habe zum Beispiel genau jetzt ca. 600 Steam Titel und 1000 Kindle Books.
Wenn ich sterbe, sind das einige 10k Euro Wert.
Wie vererbe ich die meinem Sohn?
Die Politik hat keine Antworten, und die Hersteller lassen das nicht zu.
Ich kann meinem Kind also nur mein Steam Login vermachen und von meinen Kindle-Büchern das DRM knacken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wirtschaftlich sind Kindle und Steam-Erbschaften für die Hersteller weitgehend irrelevant, oder wären sogar positiv, und es ist unklar, wieso man sich so sträubt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn ein Haus am See erbe, kann ich da hereingehen, die Veranda aufschließen, in den Park gehen und so das Asset genießen.
Das kostet mich nicht viel Zeit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erbe ich dagegen eine Kindle- oder Steam-Library, kostet mich das viel Zeit in der Erschließung:
Wenn ich 1200 Bücher erbe, sind das 30 Jahre Lebenszeit, die ich investieren muss, um das Erbe zu verarbeiten.
Wenn ich 1000 Spiele erbe, sind da Titel von 2002 bei, die heute wie Dreck aussehen.
Ich erbe &amp;ldquo;Skyrim&amp;rdquo;, muss aber &amp;ldquo;Skyrim VR&amp;rdquo; und &amp;ldquo;Skyrim Remastered&amp;rdquo; selbst kaufen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir sehen sofort: Erben ist für den Hersteller kein relevanter Umsatzverlust, sondern eher noch ein Mittel zur Verkaufsförderung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;assets-hoher-geldaufwand-geringer-zeitaufwand&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#assets-hoher-geldaufwand-geringer-zeitaufwand&#34;&gt;
	Assets: hoher Geldaufwand, geringer Zeitaufwand
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bereits heute ist in Spielen neben Lootboxen und Pay-to-Win und Pay-to-Skip Modellen der Verkauf von Cosmetics eine der größten Einnahmequellen, und im Gegensatz zu den anderen Geldquellen weitgehend unumstritten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay-to-Win: Das Spiel ist nicht erfolgreich zu beenden, außer man kauft Ausrüstungsgegenstände für Echtgeld dazu. Idealerweise wird das erst sichtbar, wenn man bereits eine Menge Zeit und Emotion in das Spiel investiert hat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay-to-Skip: Das Spiel wird immer wieder durch ärgerliche Wartepausen unterbrochen, in denen man nicht weiterspielen kann, außer man kauft die Pause durch Echtgeld weg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lootboxen: Das Spiel verkauft einem Container einem zufälligen Inhalt an Spielgegenständen, bei denen selten wertvolle Dinge enthalten sind. Das eigentliche Spiel ist also eine Verpackung für ein Glücksspiel im Inneren. Diese Praxis ist mittlerweile in einigen EU-Ländern verboten.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Im Gegensatz dazu sind Cosmetics weitgehend unumstritten: Das sind Gegenstände, die der Spielfigur und ihrer Ausrüstung ein anderes Aussehen geben, ein virtuelles Haus und seine Einrichtung, die auf das Spiel keine wesentliche Auswirkung haben und ähnliches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Im Spiel &amp;ldquo;Elder Scrolls Online&amp;rdquo; zum Beispiel bekommt man als Spieler leicht und zu geringen Kosten virtuelle Wohnhäuser in der Spielwelt, die sehr spektakulär liegen und aussehen und viel leeren Platz bieten.
Gegenstände zum Einrichten kann man sich als Trophäen erspielen, aber wesentliche Alltagsgegenstände zur Einrichtung sind nur via Echtgeld-Einsatz im Shop zu kaufen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das für den Hersteller wunderbare dabei:
Der Spieler kann in den Kauf von Cosmetics beliebig viel Geld reinpumpen und wird dabei kaum Lebenszeit oder Aufmerksamkeit aufbringen müssen.
Limitierend kann also nur die Geldbörse des Kunden wirken, nicht aber sein Zeitbudget.
Das macht so etwas zu einem viel besseren Geschäftsfeld als Bücher, Filme oder die Spiele selbst.
Das Spiel liefert nur den Kontext und Anlass für die Cosmetics zu existieren und bestimmt ihr Aussehen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epic-games&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#epic-games&#34;&gt;
	Epic Games
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dies ist genau die Geschäftsgrundlage von Epic Games:
Mit der Unreal Engine bietet die Firma eine Plattform zum schnellen und effizienten Design von sehr gut aussehenden Videospielen.
Dazu gehören auch Werkzeuge zum Erzeugen der Ingame-Assets, aber auch der Betrieb einer Verkaufsplattform für solche Assets an Spielhersteller.
Mit dem Epic Launcher und dem darin integrierten Shop auch eine Plattform zum Verkauf von Spielen, und zum Erfassen von Meta- und Nutzungsdaten an Epic, die dann wiederum (gegen Geld) dem Spielhersteller als Analytics angeboten werden.
Das von Epic betriebene Payment-System ist die Pipeline, über die Geld vom Kunden zum Spielhersteller fließen kann, und über die nicht nur die Spiele, sondern auch Erweiterungen, In-Game Käufe und andere Geldausgaben abgewickelt werden können.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mit Fortnite hat man aber auch ein eigenes Spiel am Start, das zugleich auch 3D Assets an Endkunden als Ausrüstungsgegenstände, Cosmetics oder sonst wie verkaufen kann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortnite ist eine bestimmte Sorte Spiel - Player vs. Player, im Battle Royal Modus, Spieler treten gegeneinander an und der letzte Überlebende gewinnt.
Diese Sorte Spiel ist nicht für alle Zielgruppen interessant, aber die Engine von Fortnite lässt sich auch anderweitig nutzen.
Entsprechend weckt man Interesse durch Nutzung von Fortnite als &amp;ldquo;virtuelle Veranstaltungsplattform&amp;rdquo; und hält das Interesse durch Media Tie-Ins und Licensed IP aufrecht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Interpretation von Metaverse als Verwertungskette von digitalen Assets, speziell 3D Assets, als &amp;ldquo;Online-Merchandise&amp;rdquo; greift jedoch zu kurz:
Als Ökosystem mit einer kontrollierten Anzahl von großen Marktbetreibern und einer großen Anzahl von Kunden und Kreativen steht man viel besser und vor allen Dingen dauerhafter da.
Man kann Dritten auf diese Weise erlauben, untereinander Handel zu treiben, aber dabei laufend einen geringen Anteil an allen Transaktionen abgreifen.
Gewissermaßen will man die Idee der &amp;ldquo;Microsoft-Tax&amp;rdquo; in einem anderen Kontext wieder aufleben lassen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unterschiedliche Ausgangspositionen bei&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Epic Games/Fortnite - schwach bei IP, aber original IP, wenn auch Nische, Unreal Engine und die anderen Dinge auf der &amp;ldquo;Rückseite&amp;rdquo; der Spiele als große Stärke.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roblox - original IP, sehr junge Kundschaft, erzieht sich gerade Kinder, 10 Jahre warten, groß unterschätzt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft - Minecraft, MS Store et al, zu Enterprise um erfolgreich zu sein? Aber Halo, MSFS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple (sic!) - kein IP, aber Plattform/Kette.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disney (sic!) - nur IP, aber schwach in Verwertung außerhalb von Filmen/offline Merchandise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook - will da unbedingt rein, &amp;ldquo;Enterprise Pivot&amp;rdquo;: wenn Social in Zukunft &amp;ldquo;hier&amp;rdquo; stattfindet, dann muss Facebook &amp;ldquo;hier&amp;rdquo; sein.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google - insbesondere der Grund, wieso Google Stadia nicht wirklich einstellen kann, selbst wenn es ein Flop wird/ist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon - hier ist auch die Spiele Strategie von Amazon mit einordnen. Amazon wäre gerne das AWS der Spielewelt anstelle von Epic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;

 als Market Maturity Model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir sind derzeit in einer chaotischen Phase der Marktentwicklung:
Niemand hat ein Geschäftsmodell in diesem Markt, es ist unklar, wie dieser überhaupt aussehen wird.
Standards existieren noch nicht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es geht um Landgrab, also um den Aufbau von Marktanteilen in einem entstehenden und wachsenden Markt.
Interop ist sekundär, weil noch keine Idee vorhanden ist, wie die Standards aussehen werden.
Man versucht sich vom Mitbewerb durch Features zu differenzieren, und dabei auch herauszufinden, was wichtig ist.
Alle Spieler wachsen in einem wachsenden, entstehenden Markt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sobald es ein Geschäftsmodell, stabile Featurelisten und ein System zur Geldextraktion gibt, wird sich der Markt konsolidieren.
Dann beherrschen 3-5 Firmen den Markt, der auch aus dem Hyperwachstum heraus geht.
Die marktbeherrschenden Firmen erkennen einander an und konkurrieren semi-kooperativ miteinander:
Es ist wichtiger, den Marktzugang von Disruptoren zu erschweren, und es wird komplexe, schwierig zu implementierende Standards geben, mit Compliance Prüfungen und anderen Kostenfaktoren.
Das wird dann aber auch - zähneknirschend - zu Interoperabilität führen.&lt;/p&gt;

	Metaverse, überarbeitete Definition
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das führt uns zur überarbeiteten Definition von Metaverse:
Die Integration der Spieleindustrie mit der Unterhaltungsindustrie und die Integration der Wertschöpfungsketten, mit der Möglichkeit die Verwertungskette an jeder Stelle im Produktionsfluß mit einer Art Steuer zu belegen.
Ein systematisches Anzapfen des Lifetime Intellectual Property-Konsumbudgets einer Person, und die Aufweitung des Marktes, der für einen Konsumenten relevant ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Erkenntnis, daß Buch, Filme und Spiele zu zeitaufwendig zu erstellen und zu konsumieren sind.
3D Assets ist viel größere Verkaufsgelegenheit, ohne daß der Kunde so viel Lebenszeit investieren muss, um tatsächlich den Kauf zu konsumieren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vor diesem Hintergrund ist auch die laufende Auseinandersetzung von Epic vs. Apple und Google vor Gericht zu lesen: Es geht darum, das Anzapf-Monopol von Apple und den von Apple dominierten Markt für andere zu Öffnen zu unterminieren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besondere deutsche Probleme dabei:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keine Infrastruktur für Highspeed, Low Latency wie man das für Spiele braucht.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keine deutsche Firma mit nennenswerter Identity Plattform (web.de? T-Online? &amp;ldquo;Login mit x&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keine deutschen Ressourcen im 3D-Asset Tooling, Produktion, &amp;hellip; Markt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keine deutsche Film/Fernseh/Lit Industrie zur Produktion von IP, Stories, die weltweit wiedererkennbare Kultur prägen, die man verkaufen kann.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deutscher Blick geht nach innen, ins eigene Land, nicht auf einen Weltmarkt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vergleiche dabei Korea: koreanische Produktionsketten in K-Pop; die &amp;ldquo;cultural technology&amp;rdquo; die andere Stile und Kunstrichtungen aufgreift und in K-Pop integriert; Produktionspipelines für Stars und Sternchen, aber auch für IP (beginnend).
Im Vergleich ist Deutschland essenziell wehrlos und angehängt.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#toxisch-dystopische-interpretation&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das &amp;ldquo;Eigentum&amp;rdquo; in einer simulierten Realität sieht aus wie Eigentum, ist aber virtuell und kopierbar.
Es kommt im virtuellen zur einer Entfernung von Ressourcenknappheit bei der Produktion, aber &amp;ldquo;Wert&amp;rdquo; entsteht nur, wenn die Ware künstlich verknappt wird beim Konsum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Zollhaus-Stellen, Plattformbetreiber haben volle Markttransparenz, und können das Freizeit-Konsumverhalten jeder Person genau ausmessen.
Sie wissen, was Du siehst und hörst, was Du benutzt, welche Stile Dir zusagen und können diese Information gegen Geld an Kreative verkaufen, und verkaufen den Kreativen auch gegen Geld den Zugang zu Dir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein Freund von mir:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nur ein halber Witz: man muss in Zukunft bei Geburt eines Kindes als Erstes entscheiden muss, ob es Apple-, Google- oder Facebook-Angehöriger wird und der Name erst danach entsprechend den Regeln des Dienstes festgelegt wird. Wechsel zwischen den Services ist dann komplex wie eine Emigration nach Nordkorea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zentraler Bestandteil bezüglich der Verknappung auch DRM, hier unter dem Modenamen &amp;ldquo;NFT&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;NFT&amp;rdquo; ist das Blockchain Wort für DRM, nur zusätzlich mit Umweltvergiftung durch Energieverschwendung.
Unikate gibt es nur mit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rechner zunageln,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TPM,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in-game nur lizenzierte Assets und Mods verwendbar, und&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NFT Laser Eyes Kryptoscheisse, die den Planeten verbrennt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In diesem Kontext ist auch das aktuelle Engagement von Epic im NFT Misthaufen zu lesen sehen.
Daher: korrekte Standards sind wichtig, und Identität ist die Grundlage für &amp;ldquo;Eigentum&amp;rdquo;.
Das braucht nicht nur keine Blockchain, es funktioniert auch besser ohne - die Plattformen sind eh zentral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Freund kommentiert wieder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es geht darum, dass die Leute aus dem Universum nicht rauskommen können (Stichwort: Hyperinklusion).
Sie kaufen in Metaverse-Shops, daten ihre Partner in Metaverse-Locations, sehen nur noch Werbung für im Metaverse verfügbare Waren, können Metaverse-kritische Gedanken kaum noch formulieren.
Es gibt keinen Public-Space mehr im Leben, alles ist Teil der gated community (Vgl. Verlust der Almende).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Du hast vielleicht noch einen Wettbewerb zwischen x Metaversen, aber innerhalb eines Metaversums gibt es dann einen oder nur noch einen gesteuerten Wettbewerb.
D.h. das Metaversum monopolisiert den Menschen in seiner Gesamtheit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist ein bisschen wie die Minenstädte in den USA Ende des 19. Jhd.
Der Shop gehörte der Mine, der Pfarrer arbeitete für die Mine, die Mine stellte Sheriff und Bürgermeister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effektiv will FB durch das Metaversum ihr gegenwärtiges Social-Media-Monopol verewigen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das führt thematisch zur Geldtheorie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;currency&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#currency&#34;&gt;
	Currency
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durch die CryptoCurrencies ist für die großen jetzt klar, dass die Geldschöpfung &amp;ldquo;up for the grabs&amp;rdquo; ist. Ein Metaversum wäre der perfekte Ansatz das &amp;ldquo;en passant&amp;rdquo; zu realisieren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An dieser Stelle kommt dann gleich wieder das Epic Engagement bei &amp;ldquo;Cryptocurrentcies&amp;rdquo; zum Tragen.
Das ist sehr problematisch:
Metaversum und Produktion dort nimmt nur Ressourcen aus der realen Welt, produziert dort aber nicht.
Am Ende wird die reale Welt ärmer, dort leben wir aber.
Was heißt das langfristig für Wertschöpfung und Geld?&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;rdquo;, Videospiele Growth Manager, ein Bericht. Richtige Richtung, zu kurz, erklärt aber die Kette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Im Gegensatz zu einem typischen Videospiel, bei dem man versucht, so viele Leute wie möglich dazu zu bringen, einmalig 60 Dollar für ein Spiel auszugeben, will ein Free-to-Play Spiel so viele Leute wie möglich zum Spielen zu animieren. Sobald sie spielen, bemüht sich das Unternehmen, so viele digitale Güter wie möglich an sie zu verkaufen. Es gibt zwar eine Obergrenze dafür, wie viel man für ein Spiel verlangen kann, aber es gibt keine Obergrenze für die Zahl an sinnlosen digitalen Tokens, die man verhökern kann.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time Netflix launched its streaming service, much of Hollywood knew that the future of television was online (IP TV had been deployed in the late 1999s). The challenge was timing and how to package such a service (it took another 10 years for Hollywood to accept all of their channels, genres and content needs to be collapsed into a single app/brand).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ball schreibt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Metaverse, we think, will be &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persistent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synchronous and live.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be without any cap to concurrent users, while also providing each user with an individual sense of “presence”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be a fully functioning economy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be an experience that spans both the digital and physical worlds, private and public networks/experiences, and open and closed platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offer unprecedented interoperability of data, digital items/assets, content, and so on across each of these experiences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be populated by “content” and “experiences” created and operated by an incredibly wide range of contributors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Metaverse is not…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A “virtual world”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A “virtual space”  (2nd life)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Virtual reality”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A “digital and virtual economy”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &amp;ldquo;game&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A “new app store”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A “new UGC platform”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist natürlich Unsinn, es wird alle diese Dinge &lt;em&gt;auch&lt;/em&gt; sein.
Das ist alles Valley Hype, um The Next Internet als Begriff zu etablieren und eine gemeinsame Erzählung zu haben.
Aber am Ende ist geht es genau um diese 8 Dinge die es angeblich NICHT sein soll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Es geht darum, User Engagement zu erhalten.
Das Problem muss jedes MMO lösen, denn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Die Leute leben nicht im Metaverse, die leben hier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Primärer Konsum ist Casual, nicht High End Gamer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Das ist die Schwachstelle des Konzeptes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erst wenn das Ding zu einem ständigen Ort wird, kann es ein Metaversum werden.
Das ist noch ein langer Weg:
Meine VR-Brille steht hier ungenutzt rum (Oculus verkauft, wegen FB Zwang).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist so, weil &amp;ldquo;in VR zu gehen&amp;rdquo; ein Akt ist (aufbauen, kalibrieren), und die Brille isoliert (ich bin dann weg), und weil es nicht viele Spiele gibt, die das sinnvoll nutzen (Elite Dangerous, MSFS-2020, Moss, selten auch Space Pirate Trainer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crypto Dummlall mit einigen guten Ideen, aber Illusionen über wie es laufen wird&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;1/5 of Facebook now working on AR&amp;rdquo;, für FB ist das Metaverse zur Zeit &amp;ldquo;Oculus&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;VR&amp;rdquo;. Das ist ein gefährlicher Tunnelblick (siehe oben &amp;ldquo;casual&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The &amp;ldquo;Metaverse&amp;rdquo; is a virtual space created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality, AR &amp;amp; the internet: Our current 2D search based version of the internet is giving way to a fully 3D immersive reality&amp;rdquo;: Das ist Quatsch, solange 3D nicht komplett Casual konsumierbar wird, und eine 3D Brille ist derzeit isolierend, schwer und verkabelt. 3D Assets in Pancake Games sind leichter und direkt zu verkaufen, jetzt. &amp;ldquo;Cosmetics&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Metaverse is always “on” &amp;amp; is beyond the control of any individual. It exists in real time, can host any size audience, has a functioning economy, spans across platforms, provides interoperability for digital assets, &amp;amp; consists of the content and experiences its users create.&amp;rdquo; Das Konzept 2nd 2nd Life, und die &amp;ldquo;3D Shoppingmalls&amp;rdquo; der frühen 90er feiern fröhliche Urständ, als Konzept nicht falsch und gleichzeitig total falsch. 3D Events, die Presence ersetzen sind interessant, aber super hart.
Auch hier Korean Cultural Technology, K-POP Konsum während COVID-19 (Pancake, large Audiences, Gemeinschaftserlebnisse, &amp;ldquo;VR&amp;rdquo; Nebensache)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the Metaverse, the earning power for young creators won’t be limited to the top 1%. There will be an entire new era of young entrepreneurs making a living in virtual worlds, earning real value and steady income quicker than ever imagined.&amp;rdquo; LOL. In erster Linie geht es um Zollhäuschen entlang der Verwertungskette, mit dem durch Creators erschaffenen Mehrwert als Motor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Creators who were once limited in their ability by technological constraints, lack of capital, time, or creativity, now have everything that is needed. What happens when physical objects are dematerialized? All formerly scarce materials become abundant.&amp;rdquo; LOL. DRM all the way ist notwendig, damit das funktioniert. Außerdem das Dauerversprechen vom Creators Paradise, wenn es tatsächlich um Monopolisierung der Wertschöpfungskette geht.&lt;/li&gt;

 ist, was wir machen, wenn wir noch nicht wissen, was die Design Language für eine neue Welt ist. Die ersten Autos sagen aus wie Kutschen, die ersten Apple Anwendungen haben Rolodexe und Moleskine imitiert. &amp;ldquo;Digital Twins&amp;rdquo; sind dasselbe Konzept, aber für ein Metaversum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Und die Kernidee:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2020, music artist Travis Scott staged a virtual concert inside the game that was attended live by 12.3 million people. It was a global phenomenon that sent the American rapper to the top of all music charts and earned him a reported $20 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lies: &amp;ldquo;OMG, jemand hat in einem Kinder-Battle Royale Spiel Geld verdient ohne zu metzeln, sondern mit traditioneller Medienarbeit&amp;rdquo; führt sofort zu &amp;ldquo;Alle Ideen von 2nd Life, von denen wir schon wissen, dass sie problematisch sind, feiern Wiederauferstehung.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If the metaverse is an equivalent reality that coexists next to the physical reality, there needs to be a connection,&amp;rdquo; said Weir-McCall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ist es nicht, muss es nicht. Wenn es dann doch muss, eventuell eher AR als 3D-Modelle, denn Connection zur realen Welt hat man mit einer vollen VR-Brille eben nicht. Was ich oben über Casual Konsum sage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mein Freund merkt an:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital Twins / Digital Shadows sind übrigens auch Begriffe um den die Datenspur von Leuten zu bezeichnen.
Der Gesundheitsbereich versucht das ebenso zu etablieren, um anhand dieser Zwillinge Diagnostik betreiben zu können.
Das wird auch noch einmal spannend, wie das mit dem Metaverse verbunden wird.
Gerade aus Facebooks Sicht - welche Daten kann das Metaversum aus Deinem Avatar auslesen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;facebook-glasshttpswwwreuterscomtechnologyfacebook-unveils-its-first-smart-glasses-2021-09-09-und-akzeptanz&#34;&gt;

 und Akzeptanz
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bei Google Brille waren die Träger erkennbar, der Begriff Glassholes entstand.
Mit Ray Ban ist das besser zu tarnen.
Ray Ban hat keinen technischen Beitrag zu Oculus und AR, es geht nur darum, den Markennamen und das Design als Tarnung für Oculus zu nehmen, um den Google Glass Effect zu vermeiden.
Außerdem ist AR mehr Casual als VR.
Mode erlaubt auch einfacheren Neuverkauf, siehe auch Apple Watch Zubehör.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s gonna be epic to bring the squid game to the metaverse. Salute to your team! I am a big fan of the TV series. I am super excited to have a chance to participate in this game! LFG!!!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Das Google-Mißverständnis</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2009/11/07/das-google-missverstaendnis.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 Nov 2009 16:30:16 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2009/11/07/das-google-missverstaendnis.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ich glaube ja, daß Google eine der am meisten mißverstandenen Firmen auf
diesem Planeten ist. Die meisten Leute halten Google für eine globale
Suchmaschine. Das ist wohl richtig, aber es greift viel zu kurz, wenn man
sich die Konsequenzen nicht klar macht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google selber formuliert die eigene Mission eher als den Versuch, alles
Wissen der Welt zu erfassen, zu ordnen und gezielt zugreifbar zu machen. Das
ist besser, aber die meisten Leute lesen das nicht oder denken nicht darüber
nach, was das bedeutet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google betreibt zum Beispiel Rechenzentren in aller Welt. Rechenzentren sind
Kisten, in die man Rechner reinstellt, und in die man dann Strom, Kühlung
und Netz einfüllt und Netz rausholt. Hauptkostenfaktor bei Rechenzentren ist
Strom - also baut Google
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2009/07/15/googles-chiller-less-data-center/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Rechenzentren die weniger Strom verbrauchen&lt;/a&gt;

.
Wenn man genug Rechner reinstellt und lange genug wartet, dann bekommt man
Statistiken über die Zuverlässigkeit von
&lt;a href=&#34;http://labs.google.com/papers/disk_failures.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Harddisks&lt;/a&gt;

 (PDF) und
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~bianca/papers/sigmetrics09.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;RAM Speicher&lt;/a&gt;


(PDF). Sicher gibt es auch andere Leute, die große Mengen von Rechnern
betreiben, aber diese Leute veröffentlichen anders als Google keine
wissenschaftlichen Papers darüber. Vielleicht reden sie nicht wie Google
darüber, wahrscheinlicher ist aber, daß sie nicht auf dieselbe Weise wie
Google über ihr Handeln reflektieren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google reflektiert das eigene Handeln sehr intensiv - und zieht die
Konsequenzen daraus. Wer zum Beispiel
&lt;a href=&#34;http://royal.pingdom.com/2008/04/11/map-of-all-google-data-center-locations/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;so viele Rechenzentren wie Google hat&lt;/a&gt;

,
der braucht natürlich auch Mechanismen, um Daten zwischen diesen Data
Centers zu transferieren. Das ist nicht etwas, das man bezahlen möchte. Also
muß man sich eine günstige Methode überlegen, um Daten zwischen diesen
Rechenzentren zu transferieren -
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.voip-news.com/feature/google-dark-fiber-050707/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;gesagt, getan&lt;/a&gt;

.
Die Konsequenzen sind durchschlagend -
&lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.broughturner.com/communications/2006/11/how_little_yout.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Youtube&lt;/a&gt;


hat einen signifikanten Anteil am gesamten Webtraffic der Welt, aber Google
hat keine Traffickosten damit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In der Konsequenz bedeutet das auch, daß Google am Ende die Diskussion über
Netzneutralität nur teilweise interessiert. Google belastet die Netze von
anderen ISPs jedenfalls nicht, weil Google sein eigener ISP ist und den
erzeugten Traffic bevorzugt durch eigene Netze leitet und nur für die
&amp;rsquo;letzte Meile&amp;rsquo; durch das Netz des ISP des Endkunden leitet. Das Argument,
daß Google einem ISP Kosten erzeugt ist jedenfalls haltlos, und wird nur als
Hebel gebraucht, um an die Einnahmen von Google zu kommen oder Google zu
Zugeständnissen zu zwingen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google ist also auch
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2008/12/15/the-google-cdn/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;eine Art CDN&lt;/a&gt;

,
wenn man das so sehen will - die Rechenzentren sind jedenfalls über die
ganze Welt verteilt und können in den meisten Fällen sehr nahe am Endkunden
sein. Damit das so sein kann braucht man jedoch neben Bandbreite auch noch
&lt;a href=&#34;http://labs.google.com/papers/gfs.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ein Dateisystem&lt;/a&gt;

 und in Kombination damit
&lt;a href=&#34;http://features.techworld.com/storage/3184/googles-storage-infrastructure--part-2/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;eine Art HSM&lt;/a&gt;

,
das nicht nur Replikation der Daten regelt, sondern die Daten auch
netzwerktopologisch nahe an den Verbrauchern einlagert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google hat das und minimiert so auch den Verkehr im eigenen Netz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Daten werden dann in Berechnungen benötigt, und die Berechnungen sollen
angesichts der Massen von verfügbaren Rechnern parallelisiert werden. Dazu
hat man einen Mechanismus entwickelt, der
&lt;a href=&#34;http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Map Reduce&lt;/a&gt;

 heißt und der es
erlaubt, eine Berechnung auf eine große Menge von Rechnern zu verteilen,
parallel auszuführen und die Ergebnisse einzusammeln. Das MapReduce
Framework kümmert sich dabei um das Management der Berechnungsinfrastruktur,
für den Entwickler bleibt also &amp;ldquo;nur&amp;rdquo; die Arbeit, die Berechnung in einer
MapReduce-geeigneten Weise zu zerteilen und aufzuschreiben. Das ist die
Grundlage, auf derer Google-Entwickler Anwendungen schreiben können und die
ihnen erlaubt, diese Anwendungen auf 10^9 User hoch zu skalieren, ohne den
Code übermäßig anpassen zu müssen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aber das ist Infrastruktur. Auf einer höheren Ebene passieren ebenfalls
spannende Dinge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eine der Grundideen, die sich strategisch durch alle diese Aktivitäten von
Google ziehen, ist die Unabhängigkeit von anderen Firmen. Ein schönes
Beispiel dafür ist nicht nur die oben verlinkte Dark Fiber-Aktion, sondern
auch die Entwicklung von
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iphone-scoop.com/2009/10/turn-by-turn-based-navigation-apps-by-google/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Googe Maps mit Turn-based Navigation&lt;/a&gt;

.
Seit Anfang 2005 veröffentlicht Google in Google Maps auch Fotografien
entlang der Strecke, die durch spezielle Kamerawagen erfaßt worden sind.
Diese Erfassung muß also schon früher begonnen haben, die Konstruktion der
Spezialfahrzeuge noch früher (der IPO von Google war jedoch im August 2004 -
das zum Thema langfristige Planung).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dieser Datenfundus ist inzwischen groß genug, um mit diesen Daten auch &amp;rsquo;turn
based navigation&amp;rsquo; anbieten zu können und dabei weder von Teleatlas noch
NavTeq als Datenquelle abhängig zu sein. Das war
&lt;a href=&#34;http://battellemedia.com/archives/002306.php&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;schon vor 3 Jahren vermutet worden&lt;/a&gt;

, aber auch
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.finanzen.net/nachricht/aktien/Google-greift-mit-neuer-Handy-Software-Navi-Hersteller-an-692403&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;aktuelle Analysen greifen noch zu kurz&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denn mit Geodaten und Positionsinformationen aus Latitude lassen sich noch
viele andere Dinge machen: Google füttert seine Kartendaten mit den
Kennungen von Mobilfunknetzen aus Google Maps auf Mobiltelefonen und benutzt
diese Information wiederum um ihr AGPS schneller zu machen. Mit den Daten
aus Latitude lassen sich wiederum - eine ausreichende Nutzerdichte
vorausgesetzt - Verkehrsströme erfassen, mappen und später vorhersagen. Wenn
Maps dabei auf Mobiltelefonen läuft und die Telefone &amp;lsquo;in-car mode&amp;rsquo;
signalisieren, dann kann man sogar Fußgänger und Autofahrer sicher
voneinander unterscheiden, und mit den verwendeten Navigationszielen auch
Vorhersagen für etwa Busnetzbetreiber machen, die diese Daten zur
Angebotsoptimierung verwenden könnten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google macht aber nicht nur Geoinformation, sondern spielt auch auf anderen
Märkten. Dabei ist Google so modern und flexibel, daß die jeweils
etablierten Player auf diesen Märkten als &amp;lsquo;wehrlos&amp;rsquo; gelten müssen. Googles
Buchdigitalisierungsprojekt zum Beispiel ist so groß und umfassend, daß sich
die Print-Industrie Existenzängsten ausgesetzt sieht und nach Regulierung
schreit, anstatt mit Google über neue Geschäftsmodelle zu verhandeln. Aber
statt Dinge wie Markterweiterung, Paradigmenwechsel und so zu thematisieren
bekommt man Statements von Ledereinbandsfetischisten und Liebhabern des
haptischen Bucherlebnisses die circa kurz nach Gutenberg stehen geblieben
sind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die verwandte Zunft der Nachrichtenagenturen fordert gar ein
&lt;a href=&#34;http://carta.info/16569/koalition-plant-leistungsschutzrecht-fuer-verlage/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Leistungsschutzrecht&lt;/a&gt;


für Nachrichten. Das ist eine Idee, die ich mit großem Amusement verfolge,
denn unsere Regierung will dieses Recht auf Betreiben der Agenturen
schaffen - und so werden wir beobachten können, wie genau dieses Recht am Ende die
Agenturen umbringen wird. Denn es werden am Ende Nachrichten von Googles
Agentur sein, die durch dieses Recht geschützt werden, und so werden die
überlebenden traditionellen Verbraucher von Nachrichten am Ende von dort
lizensieren müssen. Oder glaubt jemand nach der Google
Maps/Streetview-Aktion, daß Google sich in &lt;em&gt;dieser&lt;/em&gt; Sache von externen
Firmen abhängig machen lassen wird, wenn sie es schon bei Kartendaten nicht
zugelassen haben?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es gibt noch etwas anderes, das mich sehr fasziniert, und das ist die
geringe Zahl von beobachtbaren Fuck-Ups bei Google. Ich vermute, daß man bei
Google nicht viel anders arbeitet als etwa bei uns, d.h. daß man als
web-basierendes Unternehmen so agil ist, wie es die eigene Größe irgend
erlaubt. Bei solchen Rollouts kann es
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zdnet.de/news/wirtschaft_telekommunikation_google_bestaetigt_ausfall_von_google_mail_story-39001023-39189745-1.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;zu Ausfällen kommen&lt;/a&gt;

,
aber tatsächlich sind diese sehr sehr selten im Verhältnis zu der Anzahl der
Rollouts, die stattgefunden haben müssen. Viele Pannen, die Google
unterstellt werden, sind dabei noch nicht einmal welche: Die
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.boygeniusreport.com/2009/10/19/random-users-google-voice-mail-is-searchable-by-anyone/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Google Voice&lt;/a&gt;


Sache ist ein klassischer PEBKAC, und auch die
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/03/07/huge-google-privacy-blunder-shares-your-docs-without-permission/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Google Docs&lt;/a&gt;


Sache ist mindestens partiell ein PEBKAC. Alles in allem habe ich angesichts
der Größe der Operation, der Anzahl der Mitarbeiter und der Frequenz der
Codechanges einen Heidenrespekt vor der Qualität, die Google da produziert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es ist klar, daß es Mechanismen und eine Kultur geben muß, die das erzeugt
und die solche Fuck-Ups erkennt und im Ansatz verhindert. Es gibt Theorien,
die sich mit der
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/2008/thoughts-on-googles-20-time/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;20% Time&lt;/a&gt;

 von
Google beschäftigen. Es sieht wohl so aus, daß die meisten Googler diese
Zeit verwenden, um intern Code Changes von Kollegen zu sichten und zu
prüfen. Bei
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cringely.com/2009/09/the-peoples-republic-of-google/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Cringely&lt;/a&gt;


wird das näher beschrieben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dazu kommt noch, daß man Sachen, die sich messen lassen, auch mißt und sich
nicht mit Meinungen aufhält, wenn man harte Daten haben kann -
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/jul/08/google-search-marissa-mayer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Marissa Mayer&lt;/a&gt;


zum Beispiel ist bekannt dafür, daß sie einmal die
&lt;a href=&#34;http://gigaom.com/2009/07/09/when-it-comes-to-links-color-matters/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Klickraten von 40 verschiedenen Blautönen&lt;/a&gt;


hat Messen lassen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn man nun einmal ein paar Schritte zurücktritt und das Gesamtbild auf
sich wirken läßt, dann erkennt man Muster:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alles in allem wirkt der Ansatz von Google auf mich wie eine Firma von
Physikern oder anderen Experimental-Forschern mit akademischem Background,
die beschlossen haben, einmal &amp;lsquo;so richtig&amp;rsquo; in die Wirtschaft zu gehen und
ihre Methoden dort hin zu portieren. Man baut Modelle, identifiziert
Abhängigkeiten und eliminiert sie konsequent und man hat keine Angst, dabei
auch richtig groß zu denken und Neuland zu betreten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auf eine Weise betreibt man Grundlagenforschung, aber nicht in der
Abgeschiedenheit von Menlo Park oder einem anderen Elfenbeinturm, sondern
gleich in der Produktion.&lt;/p&gt;
