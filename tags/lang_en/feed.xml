      <title>Getting rid of phishing training mails</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just like your work computer is being infested with corporate malware as to prevent it from being taken over from other people&amp;rsquo;s malware,
your account is also being spammed with corporate malware spam as to prevent it from being taken over by other malware spam.
And just like corporate malware &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2018/06/18/websense-dlp-gives-instant-root.html&#34;&gt;increases your machine&amp;rsquo;s attack surface&lt;/a&gt;

,
because it is &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/10/20/aslr.html&#34;&gt;badly written&lt;/a&gt;

 and running with privileges,
corporate spam is a useless &lt;a href=&#34;https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000119662&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;nuisance&lt;/a&gt;

 that
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/solving-phishing-is-not-simple-can-anti-phishing-training-make-it-even-worse/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;doesn&amp;rsquo;t do what it is supposed to do&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, working in an enterprise, you will be subjected to such campaigns anyway.
So the best outcome for you would be to identify a phishing training campaign when it runs the first time,
and then upgrade your filters so that you will never be bothered again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that all phishing training campaigns have automatically detectable traits,
mostly X-Header lines, because the campaign needs to be able to deliver quantifiable results to the corporate overlords that pay for it.
And of course, we can filter for these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-x-header&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-x-header&#34;&gt;
	The X-Header
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What X-Header actually is being used depends a lot on the Phishing Training service provider your company is using.
It may be something such as &lt;code&gt;X-KnowB4&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;X-PhishMe&lt;/code&gt; or similar.
To find out what it is, you need to check the actual raw message content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mail.app, select the message you have identified as phishing training mail, and select
&lt;code&gt;View -&amp;gt; Message -&amp;gt; Raw Source (⌥⌘U)&lt;/code&gt;.
Then check for lines that start with &lt;code&gt;X-&lt;/code&gt; in the header that identify the training provider or reference &amp;ldquo;Phish&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/05/phish-06.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;See Message Raw Source in Mail.app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Outlook for Mac, select the message you have identified as phishing training mail, and select
&lt;code&gt;View Source&lt;/code&gt;.
Then check for lines that start with &lt;code&gt;X-&lt;/code&gt; in the header that identify the training provider or reference &amp;ldquo;Phish&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/05/phish-07.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;See Message Raw Source in Outlook for Mac.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The line you are looking for might be looking like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/05/phish-08.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*In our case, the line identifying the phishing training mails looks like &lt;code&gt;X-Phishme: Phishing_Training&lt;/code&gt;.
In fact, we only care about the presence of the &lt;code&gt;X-PhishMe&lt;/code&gt; header line and the actual value after the &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; is completely irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This header, in the exact spelling shown, is what we want. It is best to copy and paste it to prevent spelling errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;mailapp&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#mailapp&#34;&gt;
	Mail.app
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m on a Mac, and for a long time my corporate email was on Gmail.
Unfortunately, Gmail cannot filter on arbitrary X-headers, and registering an application to OAuth against corporate mail is complicated.
But Apple&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;Mail.app&lt;/code&gt; comes preregistered, was allowed, and can filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/05/phish-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I can just sacrifice another 200 MB or so to the God of Better Mail and get proper filters in return.
In any case, &lt;code&gt;⌘-,&lt;/code&gt; (&amp;ldquo;Cmd-Comma&amp;rdquo;) gives me the &lt;code&gt;Rules&lt;/code&gt; menu, and from there I can &lt;code&gt;Add Rule&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/05/phish-02.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would want to add a filter on the Header-Line &lt;code&gt;X-PhishMe&lt;/code&gt;.
For what, we want to create a rule that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/05/phish-03.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is what our filter should look like, but it can&amp;rsquo;t.
That is, because the first time around Mail.app does not know about this &lt;code&gt;X-&lt;/code&gt; header.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, your Mail.app does not yet understand this particular X-Header, so when you want to create this rule,
you need to &lt;code&gt;Edit header list...&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/05/phish-04.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then add the header to the list of known header lines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/05/phish-05.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only now can you create the filter as shown above.
In this example, I have moved the message to the Trash Bin, but you can choose any target you want.
Whatever you do, make sure that the last action you choose is &amp;ldquo;Stop evaluating rules&amp;rdquo;, then hit OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now drag the rule up so that it becomes the first rule in the list.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;outlook&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#outlook&#34;&gt;
	Outlook
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Outlook for Mac, also hit &lt;code&gt;⌘-,&lt;/code&gt; (&amp;ldquo;Cmd-Comma&amp;rdquo;) and choose &lt;code&gt;Rules&lt;/code&gt;.
Create a new rule and make sure it is enabled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/05/phish-09.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/05/phish-10.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, move the message to a folder of your choice, and make sure to enable &amp;ldquo;Stop processing more rules&amp;rdquo;.
Make sure the rule is the first one in the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#summary&#34;&gt;
	Summary
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All phishing trainings need to have uniquely identifiable marks in order for the training campaign to produce the required key performance indicators.
We can find these labels and use them to filter.
Our mailer will automatically ignore subsequent runs of the phishing training, for our peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>50 years in filesystems: towards 2004 – LFS</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/05/17/50-years-in-filesystems-towards-2004-lfs.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 May 2023 01:02:03 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/05/17/50-years-in-filesystems-towards-2004-lfs.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is part 5 of a series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/05/05/50-years-in-filesystems-1974.html&#34;&gt;1974&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;rdquo; on the traditional Unix Filesystem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/05/06/50-years-in-filesystems-1984.html&#34;&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;rdquo; on the BSD Fast File System.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/05/12/50-years-in-filesystems-1994.html&#34;&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;rdquo; on SGI XFS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/05/15/50-years-in-filesystems-vnodes.html&#34;&gt;Vnodes&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;rdquo; on how to have multiple filesystems in Unix.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progress is sometimes hard to see, especially when you have been part of it or otherwise lived through it.
Often, it is easier to see by comparing modern educational material and the problems discussed with older material.
Or look for the research papers and sources that fueled the change. So this is what we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;frontiers-in-the-nineties&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#frontiers-in-the-nineties&#34;&gt;
	Frontiers in the Nineties
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SGI&amp;rsquo;s XFS is pretty much the culmination point in filesystem technology for anything that does in-place updates.
Extents, generous usage of B+-trees and lock splitting across allocation groups make it a great filesystem that is fast and scales well.
The introduction of a metadata log allows it to recover quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nineties were also busy with operating systems research.
Specifically, cluster operating systems were very much en vogue:
Tanenbaum was in Amsterdam, busy with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoeba_%28operating_system%29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Amoeba&lt;/a&gt;

.
Bell Labs was busy with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Plan 9&lt;/a&gt;

.
And at the UCB, Ousterhout was working on &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_%28operating_system%29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Sprite&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All were experimenting with cluster-unified filesystems, distributed processing, workload migration,
and generally trying to build what 20 years later would become the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Datacenter-Computer-Introduction-Warehouse-Scale-Architecture/dp/159829556X&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Warehouse-Scale Computer&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the Sprite development at UCB, specifically, was the Log-Structured File System (LFS), and
Mendel Rosenblum and John K. Ousterhout present it in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/sd93/seltzer.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;

 from 1992.
This is a long paper, 27 pages, but if you read it with hindsight, you can really appreciate how enlightened it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;lfs&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#lfs&#34;&gt;
	LFS
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filesystems with in-place updates are in part already using logs for faster recovery in 1992.
The paper poses the question &amp;ldquo;What if we had a filesystem that only had a log, and never did in-place updates?&amp;rdquo;,
calling it a log-structured file system.
It then proceeds to present an implementation and benchmarks for such a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reads-are-cached-only-writes-matter&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#reads-are-cached-only-writes-matter&#34;&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Reads are cached, only writes matter&amp;rdquo;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In working with distributed operating systems, the Sprite team noticed that they have a lot of memory available.
They found with increasing memory sizes, the probability of a file being served by the buffer cache instead of reading it from disk increased by a lot,
and eventually almost all disk reads are being served from memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writes cannot be cached very well, and eventually they need to hit persistent storage,
but with the reads being cached it would be worthwhile and possible to construct a filesystem optimized for writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also observes that CPU speeds grow exponentially, following Moore&amp;rsquo;s law.
The same seems to be true for memory sizes, which being on-chip silicon structures also obey this law.
But disks do not work that way.
While their capacity grows, their transfer speed and seek time does not improve much, because mechanical parts do not obey Moore&amp;rsquo;s law.
Disks are a problem: While linear writes perform well, seeks are slow and are not getting faster much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they propose never overwriting any data, but always appending changed blocks to the end of a log.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/05/log-adoption.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;em&gt;“Ah you think the log is your ally? You merely adopted the log. I was born with it, designed for it.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;garbage-collection&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#garbage-collection&#34;&gt;
	Garbage collection
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, disks in the Nineties were finite, as they are now.
So there has to be a &lt;em&gt;cleaner&lt;/em&gt; process that identifies, frees and compacts space that is no longer needed by any current view of the filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is much like the Garbage Collection in Java Virtual Machines, which were invented around the same time.
And much like the GC in JVMs, it would turn out to be the weak spot of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the paper busies itself with simulating workloads on the filesystem with different cleaner policies,
and the team then lands on a system that very much evolves in the same way Java GC evolved,
with a multi-tier compaction process that mirrors the &amp;ldquo;Young&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Old&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Permanent&amp;rdquo; generations of Java objects.
This is not entirely surprising from hindsight:
Other, newer systems such as Cassandra, Zookeeper and other storages that use LSM Trees are using a very similar strategy with good success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, LFS partitions the storage into contiguous segments, and cleans storage segment by segment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used a simulator to explore different cleaning policies and discovered a simple but effective algorithm based on cost and benefit:
it segregates older, slowly changing data from younger rapidly changing data and treats them differently during cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other code takes multiple nearly empty segments of the same age and copies them together into a single segment, freeing up the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a certain amount of background copy activity from the cleaner process.
It also creates a race between the writers to the system using up free space,
and the cleaner process trying to provide sufficient free space.
If the system writes data heavily and free space goes down, the cleaner may need to be prioritized higher,
consuming more I/O, in order to make sufficient progress in providing clean segments to write to.
This will also slow down the writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benchmarks executed as part of the research show that the system can indeed write to disk at up to 70% of the theoretically available maximum bandwidth.
But this is true only under ideal conditions.
Also, the data is not stored in read-order at all, so read performance is only good if data is actually cached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Segments are sufficiently large to amortize the cost of seeking to them.
In the Mid-Nineties, that meant a size of around 0.5 to 1 MB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleaning is then a three-step process:
After suitable segments have been identified from metadata,
the cleaner reads multiple segments into memory, compacts them into a smaller number of segments,
and writes them out to disk in a single large I/O operation.
The old segments can now be marked as clean, and be returned to the free segment pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-ffs-data-structures&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#using-ffs-data-structures&#34;&gt;
	Using FFS data structures
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LFS uses data structures from FFS almost unchanged:
The filesystem has superblocks, inodes, direct and indirect blocks, and uses the same structures for directories, too.
All information changed is buffered and then written out sequentially in a single disk write that appends atomically and asynchronously to the log.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not overwriting things means duplicating things, so when a file grows by appending a block, the file&amp;rsquo;s inode changes.
This means the block containing the changed inode needs to be written out again, together with block added to the file.
LFS needs to keep track of inodes in an &lt;em&gt;inode map&lt;/em&gt;, and this now also needs to be updated and written out:
even if it is small enough to be cached in memory, it needs to be persisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/05/lfs-structures.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;em&gt;LFS does indeed to limited in-place updates: The superblock and checkpoint region are written in fixed locations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LFS stops short of also appending new copies of the inode map and ultimately the superblock for each disk write,
and puts these things into fixed locations.
So we do have in-place updates for certain limited metadata structures.
This is unfortunate, as we will see when we are looking at LFS&amp;rsquo; legacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;soft-updates&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#soft-updates&#34;&gt;
	Soft Updates
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for LFS to write out changes to data and metadata such as indirect blocks, direct blocks, inodes and directories,
updates had to be written in the proper order, even if the entire write happened in a single big I/O operation.
Writing out data &amp;ldquo;from the leaves of the filesystem tree to the top&amp;rdquo; sorts the updates in a way that made recovery easier,
because each data structure that had pointers to dependent blocks would be written out only after these blocks had already been persisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that this logic also has merit for traditional filesystems that do in-place updates.
It allows &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/bsdcon02/mckusick.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;file system checking to go on in the background&lt;/a&gt;

 while the filesystem is already being made available,
and it can &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/usenix99/mckusick.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;eliminate almost all synchronous metadata updates&lt;/a&gt;

 in the filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;lfs-in-bsd&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#lfs-in-bsd&#34;&gt;
	LFS in BSD
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BSD FFS crew, also at UCB, was very aware of Ousterhout&amp;rsquo;s work, and picks it up the year after he publishes.
They port the filesystem to BSD and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/sd93/seltzer.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;write a 1993 paper about it&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/05/lfs-ffs-feature-comparison.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Features and subsystems of BSD FFS are matched with the equivalent structures and concepts on the BSD LFS side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They note a few shortcomings, and present improvements:
The cleaner was single-threaded. No matter how many LFS filesystems were mounted, there was only a single cleaner process.
Now there is one per mounted filesystem.
They also provide a structural verifier for the filesystem, something similar to a &lt;code&gt;fsck&lt;/code&gt;, but a thing that can run in the background,
while the filesystem is mounted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the original LFS code was using more memory than necessary, and BSD LFS was made a lot more memory efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the paper is then a validation that their implementation is indeed a faithful port, and an improvement over original LFS,
and benchmarking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmarks confirm improved write performance, but also show weakness concerning read workloads.
This is for two reasons: data is possibly fragmented,
and the file system buffer cache in their machines is often too small to soak up the disk reads.
And secondly, when the cleaner process is running, it interacts badly with both the disk reads and writes via disk seeks,
and that costs more performance than anticipated.
This is in particular true for a database-like (TPC-B) benchmark load,
which performs badly and requires extensive tuning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, the paper already hints at several improvements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two places where in-place updates still happen.
By removing them, the filesystem would automatically become transactional and gain snapshot functionality.
In fact, each disk write would eventually create a snapshot, and actually &amp;ldquo;snapshotting&amp;rdquo; the filesystem would simply mean
to prevent the cleaner from collecting certain snapshots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding checksums to disk blocks already has happened in a few places.
Turning this into a Merkle tree would be a trivial extension, and make validating the complete integrity not only of the
structure, but also of the file data a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper already notes that ordering writes in the log in a certain way makes background validation easier:
If blocks being pointed to are written before blocks that point to them, referential integrity of the filesystem is being kept at all times.
It is just that a transaction may be incomplete, but because it&amp;rsquo;s not referenced anywhere that is not a problem,
and the disk blocks will be eventually collected and freed by the cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing in this idea is actually dependent on the filesystem being LFS.
In fact, it can and was successfully applied to BSD FFS, too, under the name of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/usenix99/mckusick.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;soft updates&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

,
allowing to mount unchecked filesystems and then running a check in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;performance-war&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#performance-war&#34;&gt;
	Performance War
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Seltzer, Bostic, McKusick et al., the original authors of the BSD FFS, were busy porting Sprite LFS to BSD,
and tuning it,
Larry McVoy and S.R. Kleiman pick up the BSD FFS sources at Sun and add support for extents to it.
The resulting patch is tiny, and the work is being documented in
&lt;a href=&#34;https://people.freebsd.org/~pfg/docs/fs/ExtentlikePerformanceforUFS.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Extent-like Performance from a UNIX File System&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Seltzers chagrin, EFS often and consistently outperforms LFS, requires little to no tuning.
In &lt;a href=&#34;https://people.freebsd.org/~pfg/docs/fs/ExtentlikePerformanceforUFS.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;File System Logging Versus Clustering: A Performance Comparison&lt;/a&gt;


this is confirmed, even if it takes a long paper with many benchmarks to arrive at this finding.
The problem is mostly with the disk seeks induced from running the cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If only something could be done about this&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something could be done, but it would happen at Sun and NetApp, and not in BSD: We&amp;rsquo;re getting ZFS and WAFL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, we&amp;rsquo;re getting things that can seek a lot faster than disks: Flash Storage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is part 4 of a series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/05/05/50-years-in-filesystems-1974.html&#34;&gt;1974&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;rdquo; on SGI XFS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progress is sometimes hard to see, especially when you have been part of it or otherwise lived through it.
Often, it is easier to see by comparing modern educational material and the problems discussed with older material.
Or look for the research papers and sources that fueled the change. So this is what we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-to-have-multiple-filesystems&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#how-to-have-multiple-filesystems&#34;&gt;
	How to have multiple filesystems
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Kleiman wrote
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Vnodes%3A-An-Architecture-for-Multiple-File-System-in-Kleiman/e0d14c74f23ef9b21c2fc37b5197fbfe348a7fcf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Vnodes: An Architecture for Multiple File System Types in Sun UNIX&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;rdquo;
in 1986.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a short paper, with little text, because most of it is listing of data structures and diagrams of C language &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rsquo;s pointing at each other.
Kleiman wanted to have multiple file systems in Unix, but wanted the file systems to be able to share interfaces and internal memory, if at all possible.
Specifically, he wanted a design that provided&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one common interface with multiple implementations,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supporting BSD FFS, but also NFS and RFS, two remote filesystems, and Non-Unix filesystems, specifically MS-DOS,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with the operations being defined by the interface being atomic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the implementations should be able to handle memory and structures dynamically, without performance impact,
reentrant and multicore capable, and somewhat object-oriented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;two-abstractions&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#two-abstractions&#34;&gt;
	Two abstractions
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked at the various operations, and decided to provide two major abstractions:
The filesystem (&lt;code&gt;vfs&lt;/code&gt;, virtual filesystem) and the inode (&lt;code&gt;vnode&lt;/code&gt;, virtual inode), representing a filesystem and a file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In true C++ style (but expressed in C), we get a virtual function table for each type, representing the class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the &lt;code&gt;vfs&lt;/code&gt; type, this is a &lt;code&gt;struct vfsops&lt;/code&gt;,
a collection of function pointers with operations such as &lt;code&gt;mount&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;unmount&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sync&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;vget&lt;/code&gt;.
Later in the paper, prototypes and functionality of these functions are explained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the &lt;code&gt;vnode&lt;/code&gt; type, likewise, we get &lt;code&gt;struct vnodeops&lt;/code&gt;.
The functions where are &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rdwr&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;close&lt;/code&gt;, of course, but also &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;unlink&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;rename&lt;/code&gt;.
Some functions are specific to a filetype such as &lt;code&gt;readlink&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;mkdir&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;readdir&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rmdir&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actual mounts are being tracked in &lt;code&gt;vfs&lt;/code&gt; objects, which point to the operations applicable to this particular subtree with their &lt;code&gt;struct vfsops *&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, open files are being tracked in &lt;code&gt;vnode&lt;/code&gt; instances, which again, among other things, have a &lt;code&gt;struct *vnodeops&lt;/code&gt; pointer.
&lt;code&gt;vnodes&lt;/code&gt; are part of their &lt;code&gt;vfs&lt;/code&gt;, so they also have &lt;code&gt;struct *vfs&lt;/code&gt; to their filesystem instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both, the &lt;code&gt;vfs&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;vnode&lt;/code&gt; need to provide a way for the implementation to implementation specific data (&amp;ldquo;subclass private fields&amp;rdquo;).
So both structures end with &lt;code&gt;caddr_t ...data&lt;/code&gt; pointers.
That is, the private data is not part of the virtual structure, but located elsewhere and pointed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vnodes-in-action&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#vnodes-in-action&#34;&gt;
	Vnodes in action
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/05/vfs-vnode-structures.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;em&gt;One full page in the paper is dedicated to showing the various structures pointing at each other.
What looks confusing at first glance is actually pretty straightforward and elegant, once you trace it out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kleiman sets out to explain how things work using the &lt;code&gt;lookippn()&lt;/code&gt; function, which replaces the older &lt;code&gt;namei()&lt;/code&gt; function from traditional Unix.
Analogous to &lt;code&gt;namei()&lt;/code&gt;, the function consumes a path name, and returns a &lt;code&gt;struct vnode *&lt;/code&gt; to the vnode represented by that pathname.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathname traversal starts at the root vnode or the current directory vnode for the current process,
depending on the first character of a pathname being &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The function then takes the next pathname component, iteratively, and calls the &lt;code&gt;lookup&lt;/code&gt; function for the current vnode.
This function takes a pathname component, and a current &lt;code&gt;vnode&lt;/code&gt; assuming it is a directory.
It then returns the &lt;code&gt;vnode&lt;/code&gt; representing that component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a directory is a mountpoint, it has &lt;code&gt;vfsmountedhere&lt;/code&gt; set.
This is a &lt;code&gt;struct vfs *&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;lookuppn&lt;/code&gt; follows the pointer,
and can call the &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; function for that &lt;code&gt;vfs&lt;/code&gt; to get the root &lt;code&gt;vnode&lt;/code&gt; for that filesystem, replacing the current &lt;code&gt;vnode&lt;/code&gt; being worked on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inverse must also be possible:
When resolving a &amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;..&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo; component and the current &lt;code&gt;vnode&lt;/code&gt; has a root flag set in its &amp;ldquo;flags&amp;rdquo; field,
we go from the current &lt;code&gt;vnode&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;vfs&lt;/code&gt; following the &lt;code&gt;vfsmountedhere&lt;/code&gt; pointer.
Then we can use the &lt;code&gt;vnodecovered&lt;/code&gt; field in that &lt;code&gt;vfs&lt;/code&gt; to get the &lt;code&gt;vnode&lt;/code&gt; of the superior filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, upon successful completion, a &lt;code&gt;struct vnode*&lt;/code&gt; representing the consumed pathname is returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;new-system-calls&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#new-system-calls&#34;&gt;
	New system calls
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to make things work,
and to make things work efficiently, a few new system calls had to be added to round out the interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is here in Unix history that we get &lt;code&gt;statsfs&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fstatsfs&lt;/code&gt;, to get an interface to filesystems in userland.
We also gain &lt;code&gt;getdirentries&lt;/code&gt; (plural) to get multiple directory entries at once (depending on the size of the buffer provided),
which makes directory reading faster a lot for remote filesystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;in-linux&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#in-linux&#34;&gt;
	In Linux
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the Linux kernel source, we can find the general structure of Kleiman&amp;rsquo;s design,
even if the complexity and richness of the Linux kernel obscure most of it.
The Linux kernel has a wealth of file system types, and added also a lot of functionality that wasn&amp;rsquo;t present in BSD 40 years ago.
So we find a lot more structures and system calls,
implementing namespaces, quotas, attributes, read-only modes, directory name caches, and other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-file&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-file&#34;&gt;
	The file
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, if you squint, the original structure can still be found:
Linux splits the in-memory structures around files in two, the opened &lt;code&gt;file&lt;/code&gt;, which is an inode with a current position associated,
and the &lt;code&gt;inode&lt;/code&gt;, which is the whole file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find instances of file objects, &lt;code&gt;struct file&lt;/code&gt;, defined
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.3/include/linux/fs.h#L942C3-L981&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;

.
Among all the other things a file has, it has most notably a field &lt;code&gt;loff_t f_pos&lt;/code&gt;,
an offset (in bytes) from the start of the file,
the current position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file&amp;rsquo;s class is defined via a virtual function table.
We find the pointer as &lt;code&gt;struct file_operations *f_op&lt;/code&gt;,
and the definition &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.3/include/linux/fs.h#L1754-L1798&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;

.
It shows all the things a file can do, most notable, &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;close&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;lseek&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file also contains pointers to the inode, &lt;code&gt;struct inode *f_inode&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-inode&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-inode&#34;&gt;
	The inode
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operations on files without the need of an offset work on the file as a whole,
defined as &lt;code&gt;struct inode *&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check the definition &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.3/include/linux/fs.h#L595-L705&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;

.
We see other definitions in here that have no equivalent in BSD from 40 years ago, such as ACLs and attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find the inode&amp;rsquo;s class is defined via a virtual function table,
&lt;code&gt;struct inode_operations *i_op&lt;/code&gt;,
and the definition &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.3/include/linux/fs.h#L1800-L1840&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;

.
Again, a lot of them deal with new features such as ACLs and extended attributes,
but we also find we expect such as &lt;code&gt;link&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;unlink&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rename&lt;/code&gt; and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inode also contains a pointer to a filesystem, the &lt;code&gt;struct super_block *i_sb&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-superblock&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-superblock&#34;&gt;
	The superblock
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mountpoint is represented as an instance of &lt;code&gt;struct super_block&lt;/code&gt;,
defined &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.3/include/linux/fs.h#L1136-L1268&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;

.
Again, the class is a &lt;code&gt;struct super_operations *s_op&lt;/code&gt;, defined
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.3/include/linux/fs.h#L1886-L1918&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an added complexity, there is no finite list of filesystems.
It is instead extensible through loadable modules, so we also have a &lt;code&gt;struct file_system_type&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.3/include/linux/fs.h#L1886-L1918&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;

.
This is basically a class with only one class method as a factory for superblocks, &lt;code&gt;mount&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#summary&#34;&gt;
	Summary
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unix changed.
It became a lot more runtime extensive, added a lot of new functionality and gained system calls.
Things became more structured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the original design and data structures conceived by Kleiman and Joy held up, and can still be found in current Linux, 40 years later.
We can point to concrete in Linux code, which while looking completely different, is structurally mirroring the original design ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Fri, 12 May 2023 12:13:14 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/05/12/50-years-in-filesystems-1994.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is part 3 of a series.
The first part is &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/05/05/50-years-in-filesystems-1974.html&#34;&gt;1974&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;rdquo;.
The second part is &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/05/06/50-years-in-filesystems-1984.html&#34;&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progress is sometimes hard to see, especially when you have been part of it or otherwise lived through it.
Often, it is easier to see if you compare modern educational material, and the problems discussed with older material.
And then look for the research papers and sources that fueled the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Linux (and Unix in general), this is easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;1994--the-sgi-xfs-filesystem&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#1994--the-sgi-xfs-filesystem&#34;&gt;
	1994 — The SGI XFS Filesystem
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1994, the paper &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scs.stanford.edu/nyu/02fa/sched/xfs.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Scalability in the XFS File System&lt;/a&gt;

 saw publication.
Computers got faster since 1984, and so did storage.
Notably, we are now seeing boxes with multiple CPUs, and with storage reaching into the Terabytes.
The improvements to the 4.3BSD fast filing system (or the modified version in SGI IRIX called EFS) were no longer sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SGIs benchmarks cite machines that had large backplanes with many controllers (one benchmark cites a box with 20 SCSI controllers),
many disks (three-digit-numbers of hard drives),
and many CPUs (the benchmarks quote 12 socket machines) with a lot of memory (up to one gigabyte quoted in the benchmarks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filesystems became larger than FFS could handle,
files became larger than FFS could handle,
the number of files per directory led to large lookup times,
central data structures such as allocation bitmaps did no longer scale,
and global locks made concurrent access to the file system with many CPUs inefficient.
SGI set out to design a fundamentally different filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the Unix community as a whole was challenged by Cutler and Custer,
who showed with NTFS for Windows NT 4.0 what was possible if you redesign from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;requirements&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#requirements&#34;&gt;
	Requirements
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The XFS filesystem was a firework of new ideas, and a large deviation from traditional Unix filesystem design.
The list of new things is long:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facilitate concurrency with
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allocation zones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inode lock splitting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;facilities for large, parallel I/O requests, DMA and Zero-Copy I/O&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scalability of access by building the filesystem around the concepts of
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B+-Trees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extents: pairs of (start, length) descriptors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;decoupling &amp;ldquo;file write&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;file layout&amp;rdquo; on disk to allow for contiguous files by using delayed allocation and preallocation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduce a write-ahead log to journal metadata changes
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;log asynchronously to allow for write coalescence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;leveraging the log for recovery, so that recovery time is proportional to the amount of data in flight, not the size of the filesystem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XFS was written with these requirements,
and primarily in order to provide a filesystem that could leverage all the performance of large SGI boxes for video editing, video serving and scientific computing.&lt;/p&gt;

	A logging filesystem, but not a log structured filesystem

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also happening at about the same time as John K. Ousterhout asking
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/papers/osfaster.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Why Aren’t Operating Systems Getting Faster As Fast as Hardware?&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;rdquo;.
Ousterhout started to explore the ideas of a log-based filesystem with the experimental Sprite operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Log-based filesystems are an extremely radical idea that we need to discuss later, even if they originally predate XFS by a bit.
But they weren&amp;rsquo;t very usable originally, because they need different hardware which can offer a lot more disk seeks.
Log structured file system ideas had to become a lot more refined to actually have an impact,
so we are going to discuss them later in the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-irix-had-before&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-irix-had-before&#34;&gt;
	What IRIX had before
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IRIX as coming already with EFS, the specially sauced-up version of BSD FFS that used extents.
It suffered from an 8 GB filesystem size limit, a 2 GB filesize limit, and it could not utilize the full hardware I/O bandwidth,
which made many customers of these fantastically expensive machines somewhat sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demands for video playback and from the database community led to requirements
that stated the new filesystem needed to support hundreds of TB of disk space,
hundreds of MB/s of I/O bandwidth and many parallel I/O requests in order to be able to saturate the hardware provided,
and all this without running out of CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title of the paper is &amp;ldquo;Scalability in the XFS File System&amp;rdquo; and not &amp;ldquo;Implementation of …&amp;rdquo;,
so it is more a show of the features provided and a superficial discussion of the implementation and the design decisions around it.
It is not an in-depth discussion of the implementation,
nor are extensive benchmarks provided.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#large-filesystems&#34;&gt;
	Large filesystems
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XFS supports large filesystems.
Previous filesystems use 32-bit pointers to blocks.
At 8 KB block size, with 32-bit block pointers, the limit is 32 TB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving to 64-bit block pointers would make many data structures multiple of 8 bytes in size, which seemed like a waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For concurrency (see below), XFS introduces the concept of &lt;strong&gt;allocation groups&lt;/strong&gt; (AGs), which are always smaller than 4 GB.
Allocation groups have local instances of the filesystem data structures, for example, inode maps or free block tracking.
These are independently locked and so allow for concurrent operations in different allocation groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allocation groups also help to save on pointer sizes:
Where possible, AG-relative block numbers are being used, and these always fit into 32-bit pointers.
In fact, a 4G allocation group can have only 1M blocks or fewer blocks (at 4K minimum blocksize),
so a single maximum sized extent within a single AG can be packed into 40 bits (5 bytes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maximum file size and filesystem size is 8 EB (2^63-1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bandwidth-and-concurrency&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#bandwidth-and-concurrency&#34;&gt;
	Bandwidth and Concurrency
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concurrent operations are a design goal for XFS.
1994 is the age of 20 MB/s SCSI controllers, but SGI built machines with large chassis that could house many controllers and many drives.
Benchmarks quote machines with an aggregate bandwidth of 480 MB/s delivering file I/O performance of over 370 MB/s with no tuning, including all overheads.
This is quite an impressive result for everyday usage in 1994.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XFS achieves this using large blocks (4 KB or 8 KB block size), and the concept of extents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;extents-and-b-trees&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#extents-and-b-trees&#34;&gt;
	Extents and B-Trees.
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extents&lt;/strong&gt; are a core concept in XFS.
They are tuples, most of the time pairs of &lt;code&gt;(startblock, length)&lt;/code&gt;.
For mapping file blocks to disk blocks (&amp;ldquo;bmap&amp;rdquo;), they are triples &lt;code&gt;(offset, length, startblock)&lt;/code&gt;.
Using truncated values, because of the size limits imposed by the maximum AG size,
they can describe a contiguous sequence of blocks up to 2M blocks in size in 4 bytes,
which is a lot more efficient than what BSD FFS did before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extents also allow XFS to do large I/O requests because they describe sections of contiguous blocks,
making it easy to create read or write requests for several blocks apiece.
It does I/O by default with 64 KB memory buffers, unless special provisions are being made to make them even larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filesystem assumes an underlying disk structure with striping, and provides a number of 2 or 3 outstanding I/O requests to allow for concurrent I/O.
It checks for backpressure, that is, it checks that the application is actually reading data.
If it does, it issues additional read requests to keep the number of requests in flight at 3 by default,
good for 192 KB in flight at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups of Extents can be collected in linear lists, but that will lead to scaling problems.
So XFS uses &lt;strong&gt;B+-Trees&lt;/strong&gt;, which degrade to linear lists if there is only one single index block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually tuples are indexed on their first value, but for some structures such as free lists, multiple indexes are kept:
It is useful to index free space by &lt;code&gt;startblock&lt;/code&gt; for closeness, but also by &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; to fit free spaces in the right size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;em&gt;Posix locks the in-memory inode to guarantee &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2018/11/29/but-is-it-atomic.html&#34;&gt;atomic writes&lt;/a&gt;

.
This makes sure any two large multiple-block writes always happen one-before-the-other.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XFS also breaks the in-memory inode locks:
Posix demands that large, overlapping, multiple block writes are totally ordered.
When they overlap, it must not happen that there is a block soup of alternating blocks from write A and write B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default implementation in most kernels is simply a file-global lock placed at the in-memory inode, making sure there can be only one writer per inode.
Implementers of databases hate that because it limits the write concurrency on any single file to One.
This is, for example, why Oracle recommends that you make tablespaces from multiple files, each no larger than one GB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XFS, in &lt;code&gt;O_DIRECT&lt;/code&gt; mode, removes this lock and allows atomic, concurrent writes, making database people very happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dynamic-inodes-and-improved-free-space-tracking&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#dynamic-inodes-and-improved-free-space-tracking&#34;&gt;
	Dynamic Inodes and improved Free Space Tracking
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With large filesystems, you can never know:
The applications may need a large number of inodes for many small files, or a small number of large files.
Also, what is a good distance between the inode and the data blocks that belong to the file?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no good answer to the first question, and &amp;ldquo;as close as possible&amp;rdquo; is the answer to the second question.
So XFS creates Inodes dynamically, as needed, in chunks of 64 inodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relatively large inode size of 256 bytes (compared to 128 in BSD FFS and 64 in traditional Unix)
is being compensated by the fact that XFS creates Inodes only as needed, and places them relatively closely to the file start.
This frees up a substantial amount of disk space –
in Unix filesystems with fixed inode counts as much as 3-4% of the disk space can be locked up in pre-allocated inodes.
And even with cylinder groups, there will be considerable distance between an inode and the first data block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because inodes can reside anywhere on the disk and not just behind the superblock, they need to be tracked.
XFS does with one B+-tree per allocation group.
The tree is indexed by the start block, and records for each inode in the chunk if it is available or in-use.
The inodes themselves are not kept in the tree, but in the actual chunks which are close to the file data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, free space is tracked in chunks, and kept in per-AG trees, indexed twice: by start block and by length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;write-ahead-log&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#write-ahead-log&#34;&gt;
	Write-Ahead Log
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recovering a large filesystem after a crash can be slow.
The recovery time is proportional to the size of the filesystem, and the number of files in it,
because the system basically has to scan the entire filesystem and rebuild the directory tree in order to sure things are consistent.
With XFS, the filesystem also is a lot more fragile, as it provides a variable number of inodes, spread out non-contiguously over the disk.
Recovering them would be extra expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using write-ahead logging for metadata, this can be avoided most of the time.
Recovery time is proportional to the size of the log, that is, the amount of data in flight at the time of the crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The log contains log entries containing a descriptor header and a full image of all changed metadata structures:
inodes, directory blocks, free extent tree blocks, inode allocation tree blocks, allocation group blocks, and the superblock.
Because full images are stored in the block, recovery is simple: the recovery process simply copies these new, changes images into the place where they are supposed to be, without needing to understand what kind of structure it changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trust of the authors into the log was huge:
Initially XFS had no &lt;code&gt;fsck&lt;/code&gt; program.
This turned out to be overly optimistic, and so now &lt;code&gt;xfs_repair&lt;/code&gt; exists.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#metadata-update-performance&#34;&gt;
	Metadata update performance
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XFS is logging metadata updates, which means they need to be written to the filesystem log.
By default, this log is placed inline, in the filesystem.
But it is also possible to take it out, and put onto other media, for example, flash storage or battery-backed memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writes to the log are asynchronous, if possible, but with partitions serving NFS they cannot be.
Asynchronous writes allow for write batching, with speeds things up.
But NFS servers profit a lot from accelerated log storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because all metadata updates need to be logged, it can happen that intense metadata operations flood the log.
A &lt;code&gt;rm -rf /usr/src/linux&lt;/code&gt; for example is not an operation where XFS is particularly fast, because the metadata update stream will eventually overflow the log.
And because everything else in XFS is parallel by AG, the log is usually the only source of contention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;large-files-and-sparse-files&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#large-files-and-sparse-files&#34;&gt;
	Large files and sparse files
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In FFS, files are mapped by the classical dynamic array, with direct blocks and up to three levels of indirect blocks.
With 64-bit filesize, this becomes unwieldy: there will be more than three levels of indirect blocks required,
and a substantial number of blocks would be required what essentially becomes a list of incrementing numbers.
FFS (and EFS) are also forced to layout blocks the moment each block is allocated in the filesystem buffer pool.
So effectively, no attempt to contiguously layout files on disk is being made.
Instead, blocks are placed individually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XFS replaces this dynamic array with extents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In file placement maps, these mapping extents are triples &lt;code&gt;(blockoffset, length, disk block)&lt;/code&gt;.
These extents are stored in the inode itself until this overflows.
Then XFS starts to root a B+-tree of the mapping extents in the inode, indexed by logical block number for fast seeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This data structure allows compressing a substantial number of blocks (up to 2M blocks) in a single descriptor,
assuming contiguous allocation is possible.
So even large files could be stored in very few extents, in the optimal case one extent per AG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;delayed-allocation-and-preallocation-for-contiguous-layout&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#delayed-allocation-and-preallocation-for-contiguous-layout&#34;&gt;
	Delayed allocation and Preallocation for contiguous layout
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XFS also provides a new concept, delayed allocation, in which virtual extents can be allocated in the file system buffer pool.
These are blocks full of yet unwritten data that have not been layouted, and hence lack a physical position.
Only on flush these blocks are layouted, contiguously, and then written out linearly in large writes, to speed things up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fundamental change to how the filesystem buffer cache works –
previously it was possible to use &lt;code&gt;(device, physical block number)&lt;/code&gt; to identify buffer cache blocks and prevent duplicate buffer allocation.
When porting XFS to Linux, the Linux kernel initially could not accommodate strategies that do not use such identification in the normal buffer cache, so at first XFS required a separate buffer cache.
This got fixed later, as the porting progressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure that files can be layouted without fragmentation, in a single extent, XFS aggressively preallocates storage for open files.
The default amount of disk space preallocated is dependent on the amount of free space in the filesystem, and can be substantial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet is littered with questions by XFS users asking where their disk space is, and the answer is always &amp;ldquo;in the open file handles of &lt;code&gt;/var/log&lt;/code&gt;. Also, check the &lt;a href=&#34;https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/xfs.5.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;manpage&lt;/a&gt;

 for &lt;code&gt;allocsize=&lt;/code&gt; and also check &lt;a href=&#34;https://linux-xfs.oss.sgi.narkive.com/jjjfnyI1/faq-xfs-speculative-preallocation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;/proc/sys/fs/xfs/speculative_prealloc_lifetime&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;locality&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#locality&#34;&gt;
	Locality
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XFS does not use allocation groups for locality much.
They exist mostly for concurrency.
Instead, file placement is mostly around directories and existing blocks of the current file.
The only exception is &amp;ldquo;new directories&amp;rdquo;, which are placed &amp;ldquo;away&amp;rdquo; from their parent directory by putting them into a different AG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In large files, if new extents need to be placed, they go &amp;ldquo;initially near the inode, then near the existing block in the file which is closest to the offset in the file for which we are allocating space&amp;rdquo;, as the paper specifies.
This places the inode close to the start of the file, and blocks added later to whatever is already present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;large-directories&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#large-directories&#34;&gt;
	Large directories
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the traditional Unix filesystem and in BSD FFS, directory name lookups are linear operations.
Large directories slow this down a lot, for any kind of pathname to inode translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XFS chose the ubiquitous B+-Tree as a structure for directories, too, but with a quirk:
Since the keys are supposed to be filenames, a variable length structure, they would be completely different from all the other tree implementations in the filesystem.
The XFS authors did not like this idea, so they are hashing the filename into a fixed 4-byte name hash, and then store one or more directory entries as &lt;code&gt;(name, inode)&lt;/code&gt; pairs in the value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was some tradeoff discussion involved in this, but the authors found that short keys allow storing many entries per block,
leading to wide trees, and thus faster lookups.
They boast &amp;ldquo;We can have directories with millions of entries&amp;rdquo;, something that was previously unthinkable in Unix filesystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-lot-of-code&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#a-lot-of-code&#34;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/05/xfs-scaling.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;em&gt;XFS Benchmarks in 1994 show nice and welcome linear scaling behavior that utilizes the hardware offered well.
It handles well on large boxes with (for 1994) high core-counts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XFS is a large filesystem.
Linux ext2 is only 5000 lines of kernel code (and about 10x this in user-land).
XFS is 50.000 lines of kernel code, and that is without the IRIX volume manager XLV (in Linux, the XFS port uses LVM2 instead).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XFS was released under the GNU GPL in May 1999, and was ported into the Linux kernel starting in 2001.
As of 2014, it was supported in most Linux distributions and RHEL used it as the default filesystem.
And even in 2024 it is still holding up reasonably well, on HDD and on flash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It still is the filesystem with the best scaling behavior, the best concurrency behavior, and the most consistent commit times,
which makes it the preferred filesystem for any kind of database usage.
This is due to the elimination of several global locks that impair concurrent usage and performance in large filesystems,
and due to the consistent use of B+-Tree structures with &lt;code&gt;O(log(n))&lt;/code&gt; scaling behavior where before algorithms with worse scaling behavior have been used.
The use of extents also allows dynamically growing I/O sizes, benefiting throughput,
and together with the novel idea of delayed allocation encourage contiguous file placement.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/05/11/city-of-amsterdam-and-combustion-engines.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Electrive.net had an article about Copenhagen banning combustion engines in the city, starting 2030:
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.electrive.net/2023/05/08/kopenhagen-will-verbrenner-autos-ab-2030-aussperren/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Article in German&lt;/a&gt;

).
So I had to check what is the current state in Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;current-state&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#current-state&#34;&gt;
	Current state
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Netherlands has a central register for license plates.
It is public, and anyone can check.
There are many places that allow you to do that for car, not owner data.
For &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.autoweek.nl/kentekencheck/P-664-rg/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city of Amsterdam also allows you to check if a given license plate is allowed to enter the cities milieuzone.
You can &lt;a href=&#34;https://ontheffingen.amsterdam.nl/publiek/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;check yourself&lt;/a&gt;

.
And so can any license plate scanner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amsterdam.nl/verkeer-vervoer/milieuzone-amsterdam/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;overview page&lt;/a&gt;

 for the milieuzone,
the city helpfully explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let op:&lt;/strong&gt; dat u de Milieuzone mag inrijden betekent niet dat u ook in aanmerking komt voor een parkeervergunning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attention:&lt;/strong&gt; Note that being allowed to enter the Environmental Zone does not mean you are also eligible for a parking permit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;after-2030&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#after-2030&#34;&gt;
	After 2030
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules for the milieuzone are becoming stricter &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amsterdam.nl/verkeer-vervoer/milieuzone-amsterdam/aanscherping-milieuzones/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;starting 2025&lt;/a&gt;

,
and by 2030 no combustion engines are being allowed in the city at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NL-wide license plate check for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.opwegnaarzes.nl/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;commercial vehicles&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New lorries will need to be electric starting 2025 to be allowed into the city.&lt;br&gt;
Existing lorries will have to be Euro 6 or better. There are some more rules for easing the changeover.
Starting 2030, no lorries with combustion engines are allowed into the city.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small commercial delivery vehicles (vans, Sprinters) with Diesel must be Euro 4 or better already.
New cars must be electric starting 2025. Euro 5 is required starting 2027, Euro 6 starting 2028,
no combustion starting 2028.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bus lines are in the process of being converted to electric, and this is nearly complete.
It will be finished by 2025.
Rules for charter buses are to follow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taxis electric starting 2025.
Tax incentives and better starting places as well as priority for parking and taxi licenses are provided already.
This is going well, most Taxis are electric already.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scooters (25 km/h and 45 km/h) must be electric by 2025.
Get a pedelec, maybe?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ships (tourist and transport) must be electric by 2025.
Ferries over the river Ij are already being converted.
70% rebate for harbor fees for electric ships right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cars must be Euro 4 or better right now.
Only electric cars are allowed into the city by 2030.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;em&gt;Scanautos are being used to automatically enforce parking rules inside the city.
They are checking around 800x more effective than an unaugmented parking enforcement human.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Amsterdam, most major streets do not allow you to park on public ground.
Side streets often have only a limited number of public parking spots,
the others require a residential parking permit.
Parking in parking structures or in the street costs around 50 Euro/day if you find a space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking permits are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; shown on the dashboard, and similarly, parking violations are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; ticketed in paper behind the windshield wiper.
Instead, everything is based on automated license plate scanning:
Enter your license plate at the parking fee collector terminal,
the scanauto will countercheck what it scanned with the central database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://algoritmeregister.amsterdam.nl/parkeercontrole/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Enforcement is automatic&lt;/a&gt;

, and the coverage is excellent.
If you do not pay, or overpark, you will be caught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amsterdam.nl/parkeren/parkeerbon/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;That will cost you&lt;/a&gt;

 at minimum 72.90 Euros in punishment,
plus fees, plus the unpaid parking fee.
In total this usually ends up between 110 Euros and 150 Euros
.
The target for processing (between parking violation and notification) is officially two days.
But it often is &amp;ldquo;while you still park&amp;rdquo; (20 minutes or less),
so near realtime.
This has the effect of ruining whatever you are currently doing in the city, so just park legally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/05/overtoom.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;em&gt;S106, Overtoom. A major inroad into the city. Note how this is one lane per direction, and no parking at the side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cheapest way to do that is to park at a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amsterdam.nl/en/parking/park-ride/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Park and Ride&lt;/a&gt;

,
and then take the tram or subway into the city.
Or just use the bus, tram, subway or train, starting at your door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city does not believe into building roads to places that have more capacity than can be parked at the destination.
So most major inroads into Amsterdam are single lane.
Not only will you not be able to park in the city.
Most likely, you will also hate every minute of getting there before you have to turn around.
Be sensible, use OV.&lt;/p&gt;

 in Amsterdam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for anybody but private individual transport, Amsterdam will be fully electric by 2025,
and the final conversion will take another 5 years.
This is not an unrealistic goal.
If you walk through the city, you can see how the conversion is already in full swing at an amazing and still increasing speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city has built the required infrastructure in terms of charge points already,
and provides maps to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But individual motorized transport does not scale to a city with the density of Amsterdam.
Cities are for humans, not for cars, and Amsterdam makes it very clear that cars are not welcome.
Use public transport to get around in Amsterdam.
That is already fully electric, and except for the buses always has been.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>It&#39;s a Modulith</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/05/10/its-a-modulith.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2023 01:02:03 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/05/10/its-a-modulith.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Computers are simple&amp;rdquo; is what I am telling people I train.
&amp;ldquo;There are only Zeroes and Ones, and it is not getting much more complicated.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But computers are hard&amp;rdquo;, they respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That is correct.
In computer systems, complexity is almost never in the individual layers, but it comes from the width and breadth of the stack.
It&amp;rsquo;s in the interactions of the components that we are putting together.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you start with how a CPU is being built, and then put the layers of the stack on top of each other until you end up with a classical single-process application, in some object-oriented language, with a GUI – that&amp;rsquo;s around two to three dozen layers of abstractions piled on top of each other.
Things that one could learn the internals of, and how they interact.
But that&amp;rsquo;s only local, without network stacks, communication protocols, proxies, and without the peculiarities of distributed systems, which open up the same exercise, again, only across, not down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot to be said about computer science as a science, because anything that complicated is working at all.
All the interfaces, encapsulations, and abstractions are obviously good for &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; – as long as they don&amp;rsquo;t leak.
When they do leak, things get weird, fast:
One is making a small change somewhere in the stack, an epsilon,
and somewhere else something acts up, non-linearly, and does a giant delta, and everybody is having a very sad day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if developers prefer to sit in enclosed offices, without a phone, and with soundproof headphones,
that is because work on such systems is mostly to unfold the stack in your mind,
and to anticipate what will happen on all the other layers when you write a line of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-amazon-prime-video-team-publishes-a-paper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-amazon-prime-video-team-publishes-a-paper&#34;&gt;
	The Amazon Prime Video team publishes a paper
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this as a background, one can now read &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.primevideotech.com/video-streaming/scaling-up-the-prime-video-audio-video-monitoring-service-and-reducing-costs-by-90&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Scaling up the Prime Video audio/video monitoring service and reducing costs by 90%&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;rdquo;,
a writeup published by the Amazon Prime Video Streaming Team.
They have implemented a functionality which probes frames from the video stream sent to customers, applies tests and recognizes certain artefacts that impair quality,
so that they can be corrected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon being Amazon, they have implemented that as a pile of microservices that interact in an event-driven architecture with lambdas and step functions,
in order to shovel data from one S3 bucket into another, running the required analytics on the way.
Notification about things found are being put on SNS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That works as expected: The project was done exploratory, as a proof-of-concept, and they were able to show that it does what was requested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scaling up, they then found that the distribution of components was suboptimal:
Lambdas and step functions are not good elements for batch processing video frames with ML detectors, because they have never been designed for this.
They are good components for web applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it turns out that S3 is not a good storage and communication mechanism for fast and very temporary IPC,
because a web storage with low cost is optimized for low transaction rates, and it targets consumers that can tolerate high latency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article then presents a solution, which was to put all these things into a single container that are tightly coupled,
and put them into ECS.
Because the components are now within a single container, and hence on the same box, sharing the same memory,
they now can exchange video frames via shared memory instead of pushing them through http and TLS over the network.
Similarly, the lambdas and step function somewhere out on the network are now local procedure calls, or at least local RPC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, that eliminates a lot of communication latencies because the high-rpm part of the distributed system is now a single local application.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-was-learned&#34;&gt;
	What was learned
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surprising part, according to the team, was that this was a mostly painless process that required only minor code changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conceptually, the high-level architecture remained the same.
We still have exactly the same components as we had in the initial design (media conversion, detectors, or orchestration).
This allowed us to reuse a lot of code and quickly migrate to a new architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they summarize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is maybe the takeaway from this article:
In a cleanly architected and properly encapsulated system, the components can be redistributed and rearranged with only minor code changes.
We can change the layout of the system without having to start over.
The architecture was not really changed, but mostly the components&amp;rsquo; deployment was rearranged.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/05/modulith-microservices.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;em&gt;A modulithic deployment of co-located microservices allows for easy scaling and rearrangement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the subtitle of the article is
&amp;ldquo;The move from a distributed microservices architecture to a monolith application helped achieve higher scale, resilience, and reduce costs&amp;rdquo;.
This sets wrong expectations and makes it harder to pick up the actual learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the AWS Prime Video team arrived at is most closely described as a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.informatik-aktuell.de/entwicklung/methoden/modulith-first-der-angemessene-weg-zu-microservices.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Modulith&lt;/a&gt;

,
only that they arrived at it the other way around.
Fowler suggests you start
&lt;a href=&#34;https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Monolith first&lt;/a&gt;


and then chisel off the components you identify as standalone subservices.
They instead used pre-made AWS infrastructure components to build a highly modular prototype,
and then identified tightly coupled components and merged their deployment without giving up the modular structure.
Fowler himself points to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://samnewman.io/blog/2015/04/07/microservices-for-greenfield/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;an article by Sam Newman&lt;/a&gt;


and the book that came from it as a way of doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is not really a single-instance monolith, anyway.
Components are merged into a single ECS container, but of course ECS will deploy it with the required degree of parallelism,
and it is still part of a larger system that communicates in an event-driven architecture using lambdas and messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if this article is anything, it is an example of the benefits good observability has,
and how a good architecture allows you to rearrange the layout of well-isolated and structured components with clean interfaces at will.
The application can be made to run on different substrates, in order to react to different demands of scale or changing business requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or in other words, people who understand how their stuff works have few problems to adjust their application to changing requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>50 years in filesystems: 1984</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/05/06/50-years-in-filesystems-1984.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 May 2023 12:13:14 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/05/06/50-years-in-filesystems-1984.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is part 2 of a series. The first part is &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/05/05/50-years-in-filesystems-1974.html&#34;&gt;1974&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progress is sometimes hard to see, especially when you have been part of it or otherwise lived through it.
Often, it is easier to see if you compare modern educational material, and the problems discussed with older material.
And then look for the research papers and sources that fueled the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Linux (and Unix in general), this is easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;1984--the-bsd-fast-filing-system&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#1984--the-bsd-fast-filing-system&#34;&gt;
	1984 — The BSD Fast Filing System
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original Unix filesystem was doing well, but also had a large number of obvious problems.
BSD Unix undertook an effort to fix them, and this is documented in the book
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/Design-Implementation-4-3Bsd-Operating-System/dp/0201061961&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Design and Implementation of the 4.3BSD UNIX Operating System&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;rdquo;
by Leffler, McKusick et. al&lt;a href=&#34;http://libgen.rs/book/index.php?md5=61457A629D5DE3B8966141A9D51FE89B&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more concise, but also more academic discussion can be found in the classic 1984 paper &lt;a href=&#34;https://dsf.berkeley.edu/cs262/FFS.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;A Fast File System for UNIX&lt;/a&gt;

,
which lists Marshall McKusick, Bill Joy (then at Sun), Samuel Leffler (then at LucasFilm) and Robert Fabry as authors.
The paper promises a reimplementation of the Unix filesystem for higher throughput, better allocation and better locality of reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-hardware&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-hardware&#34;&gt;
	The hardware
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is 1984.
The computers targeted by 4.3BSD are desktop and cabinet workstations.
These are machines with 32-bit data registers and 32-bit address registers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;External data and address bus sizes vary:
Earlier 68k CPUs had smaller sized buses, but in 1984 the Motorola 68020 debuted.
It was the first 68k to offer buses with the full width of 32 bits, at a budget of ca. 200k transistors on the die.
Later the 68030 integrated the MMU, previously a separate chip,
and the 68040 also integrated the FPU, again previously a separate chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early Sun workstations, the Sun-3 series, feature these CPUs.
But Sun took the designs from the experimental Berkeley RISC systems and released the Sun-4 series in 1986 with SPARC architecture RISC chips.
SPARC architecture is not without compromises, but was very viable and saw continuous development until after the purchase of Sun by Oracle, which then killed both the SPARC, and later also the Itanium CPU architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curt Schimmel discusses the tradeoffs made by SPARC in the MMU, register and memory access design, and why they made sense. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/UNIX-Systems-Modern-Architectures-Multiprocessing/dp/0201633388&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;UNIX Systems for Modern Architectures&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;http://libgen.rs/book/index.php?md5=0E4A02E80A6250838CB1D3C3A1405CAD&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In between, in 1985, the MIPS architecture debuted, which is another series of RISC CPU architectures. It also starts out as a fully 32-bit type of system, and found use in SGI workstations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HP had another RISC-type of CPU, the PA-RISC, an outgrowth of their &amp;ldquo;Spectrum&amp;rdquo; research programme, coming to market in 1986 (and later replaced by Intel&amp;rsquo;s failed Itanium).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systems pioneer DEC themselves had the VAX, a 32-bit cabinet computer with a CISC CPU, and that since 1977 already.
They would not go RISC until 1992, but then fully 64-bit with the Alpha AXP (&amp;ldquo;DEC Alpha&amp;rdquo;) architecture.
While interesting, this did not last long: with the sale to Compaq in 1998, the CPU was discontinued, and the IP was sold to Intel in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, workstation type systems in 1984 had main memory in the low two-digit MB range, and ran at clock speeds of two-digit MHz system clocks.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-traditional-filesystems-shortcomings&#34;&gt;
	The traditional filesystems shortcomings
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 32-bit VAX systems were being used for typical 1980&amp;rsquo;s workstation work, which include things such as image processing or VLSI chip design.
On these systems, the original Unix filesystem showed structural problems in keeping up with file size, I/O speed, and simple number of files.
Also, the tiny 512-byte I/O size slowed disk subsystem performance considerably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper mentions the strict segregation of filesystem metadata at the front of the file system from the actual data in the back part of the filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 150 MB traditional UNIX file system consists of 4 megabytes of inodes followed by 146
megabytes of data.
This organization segregates the inode information from the data; thus accessing a file
normally incurs a long seek from the file’s inode to its data.
Files in a single directory are not typically
allocated consecutive slots in the 4 megabytes of inodes, causing many non-consecutive blocks of inodes to
be accessed when executing operations on the inodes of several files in a directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This defines one major goal for BSD FFS: Better filesystem layout, bringing metadata and data closer together,
storing files in a single directory closer together,
and preventing fragmentation of a file into small fragments that can be loaded only inefficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/05/filesystem-fragmentierung.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;em&gt;Fragmentation: Initially, four files are being created, each using 2 blocks.
Then the files B and D are being deleted.
The free space is then being reclaimed by the three-block-sized file E, which is stored in non-adjacent blocks.
This causes small disk seeks, and slow I/O.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another goal stated is to increase disk block size.
Larger disk blocks benefit throughput in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Larger disk blocks provide larger units of I/O, so more data is transferred in a single I/O operation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Larger disk blocks also allow the filesystem to store more file pointers in an indirect block, greatly reducing the number of indirect block accesses.
This is primarily a problem if indirect blocks are not cached in a file system buffer cache.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper quotes the throughput of an already marginally optimized, traditional Unix filesystem at around 4% of the theoretical maximum,
which is abysmally bad.
This is mainly attributed to fragmentation, non-contiguous storage of adjacent blocks in a file.
Defragmentation, already suggested in 1976, was discarded as a non-viable idea.
The authors instead aim for a solution that places files sensibly in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#cylinder-groups-and-understanding-chs&#34;&gt;
	Cylinder Groups and understanding CHS
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BSD FFS understands the physical layout of a harddisk, with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder-head-sector&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;cylinders, heads and sectors&lt;/a&gt;

 (CHS).
It divides the disk into cylinder groups, adjacent tracks of all disk heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/05/cylinder-groups.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;em&gt;As the disk rotates, various disk heads reach inside the platter stack like a comb.
Each head marks a track on the disk, which is subdivided into physical disk blocks by the controller hardware.
Together, all tracks marked by all heads form a cylinder.
A cylinder group is a set of consecutive cylinders. (Image: &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/file-ffs.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;OSTEP&lt;/a&gt;

, page 3)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each cylinder group becomes a mini-version of a traditional Unix filesystem, with a copy of the superblock, its own local inode area, and local inode and block usage bitmaps.
The usage of bitmaps is also novel, as they replace the free lists used in the traditional filesystem.
As the filesystem has information about the CHS layout, it also makes sure that the superblock is not always placed on the same platter for each copy,
trying to make the filesystem better redundant against harddisk failure.&lt;/p&gt;

 was published only several years later,
but &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~michjc/eecs584/Papers/katz-2010.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;according to Katz&lt;/a&gt;

 was developed also in Berkeley, during the same time frame, 1983/1984.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katz also mentions that during that time Stonebraker was around, working on Ingres (a Postgres predecessor),
and refers to his demands for low-commit latency as driving the attempts on improving disk bandwidth with FFS and, later,  RAID.
Serious work on the RAID taxonomy we know today did not begin before 1987, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RAID paper was used by many startups and storage companies as the foundation of their development,
among them NetApp, and EMC (via Data General&amp;rsquo;s Clariion Disk Array)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BSD FFS not only understood CHS geometry of disks, but also processor speed and disk rotational speed.
This allowed it to configure and record in the superblock an &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleaving_%28disk_storage%29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;interleave factor&lt;/a&gt;

 to optimize disk I/O throughput.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/05/interleave.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;em&gt;The harddisk rotates continuously, but the CPU needs time to set up the next transfer.
During this time the head may have moved already past the next block start boundary, and now the system would need to wait one full rotation to be able to write.
Using an appropriate interleave factor, blocks of adjacent numbers are not stored adjacently on disk, but instead other blocks are interleaved in-between.
This gives the CPU enough time to think and set up the next block transfer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The faster the CPU, the lower the interleave factor required.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these optimizations became irrelevant relatively quickly the moment harddrives were sold with integrated controllers,
started to lie about their CHS geometry and ultimately as linear block addresses (LBA) took over.
But for ten to 15 years, this provided a nice performance advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;large-blocks-smaller-fragments-and-tail-packing&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#large-blocks-smaller-fragments-and-tail-packing&#34;&gt;
	Large blocks, smaller fragments, and tail packing
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internally, FFS uses logical blocks of at least 4 KB size.
Anything with at least 4 KB block size can create files of 4 GB size with at most two levels of indirection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large blocks make for faster I/O, but they also come with storage overhead, as files grow in sizes of blocks.
Since logical blocks in FFS are made up from multiple physical blocks, FFS introduces the concept of fragments to expose the smaller internal physical blocks.
Through tail packing, the ends of multiple files can be stored together in the same logical block, using only as many physical blocks as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional logic was necessary to prevent a slowly growing file from going through phases of fragment-by-fragment growth and constant re-layouting.
To overcome this, space is being pre-allocated to full logical blocks, and tail packing only happens on file close when the preallocation is canceled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;long-seek-layout-policy&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#long-seek-layout-policy&#34;&gt;
	Long Seek Layout Policy
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BSD FFS introduces a number of layout policies that control the placement of new directories, new files and the handling of large files.
Global policies are mostly concerned with choosing a well-suited cylinder group to place data in,
while local policies then handle the placement inside a cylinder group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new filesystem layout has cylinder groups. Each has their own inode table, and free space bitmaps for inodes and blocks.
The filesystem aims to prevent fragmentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is of course impossible in certain circumstances:
If, for example, a cylinder group is 512 MB in size, and a file larger than 512 MB is to be written, it will use up one inode in that cylinder group, but all available free blocks are gone.
If a second file is to be placed into this cylinder group, the inode can be used, but the data blocks for that file need to be placed somewhere else – which is undesirable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be better to force a long seek, a switch from one cylinder group to the next, for large files.
The filesystem would profit from forcing such a long seek every megabyte of filesize or so.
This would use up free blocks from one cylinder group to the next, evenly, while at the same time leaving some number of free blocks for other files in each cylinder group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would, of course, fragment a file, on purpose, but also make sure the fragments are sufficiently large to allow large file I/O.
Fragmentation (non-adjacent placement of blocks in a file) is only really a performance problem if the fragments are too small to be read efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;directory-layout-policy&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#directory-layout-policy&#34;&gt;
	Directory Layout Policy
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Files in the same directory are often used together.
It is useful to place all files in the same directory together in the same cylinder group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, when this is done, it is also necessary to put different directories into different cylinder groups, to ensure even use of the filesystem space available.
That means a shell script such as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;#! /usr/bin/bash
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; i in &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;seq -w &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; 10&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  touch file&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  mkdir dir&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;will create ten files named &lt;code&gt;fileXX&lt;/code&gt;, which will all be placed in the same cylinder group as the current directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will also create ten subdirectories of the current directory named &lt;code&gt;dirXX&lt;/code&gt;.
Each of them will be placed in a different cylinder group, if possible.
FFS will choose the cylinder group that has a greater than average number of free inodes, and the smallest number of directories already in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual choice of the inode in a cylinder group is &amp;ldquo;next available&amp;rdquo;, so pretty simple.
But that is not a problem, because the whole cylinder group inode table fits into 8-16 blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For placement of data blocks, a lot of effort is invested into finding rotationally optimal block, given the needed interleave factor for this machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BSD FFS requires some free space to be available in the filesystem at all times.
Many of its algorithms degenerate to the performance of the traditional file system if the filesystem fills up more than 90%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-changes-and-improvements&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#other-changes-and-improvements&#34;&gt;
	Other changes and improvements
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BSD FFS also removes several limits that came with the traditional filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;long-inode-numbers-and-block-addresses&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#long-inode-numbers-and-block-addresses&#34;&gt;
	Long Inode Numbers and Block Addresses
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/BSD-4_3_Tahoe-Snapshot-Development/.ref-BSD-4_3/usr/src/sys/h/dir.h#L42&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Inode numbers are now 32-bit numbers&lt;/a&gt;

.
This increases the number of files possible per filesystem from 64 K to 4 G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size of an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/BSD-4_3_Tahoe-Snapshot-Development/.ref-BSD-4_3/usr/src/sys/h/inode.h#L40-L59&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;inode&lt;/a&gt;

 has doubled:
It is now &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/BSD-4_3_Tahoe-Snapshot-Development/.ref-BSD-4_3/usr/src/sys/h/inode.h#L61-L65&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;forced to be 128 bytes&lt;/a&gt;

 in size (with 20 unused bytes)
Also, disk block addresses are now 4 bytes.
At 4 KB block size, this is sufficient to account for 4 G blocks, or a maximum of 16 TB filesystem size.&lt;br&gt;
File length is recorded in a &lt;code&gt;quad&lt;/code&gt;, allowing for more than 4 G individual filesize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inodes now contain 12 direct blocks, and three types of indirect blocks.
At 4 KB block size, this is good for 1024 block addresses per indirect block, resulting in
&lt;code&gt;12 + 1024 + 1024^2 + 1024^3 = 1074791436&lt;/code&gt; blocks per file, or a maximum filesize just north of 4 TB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unix User-ID and Group-ID are still limited to a short, limiting the number of users and groups per system to 64 K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Space has been preallocated for 8-byte timestamps, even if the time types in the inode are still limited to 4 bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;long-filenames&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#long-filenames&#34;&gt;
	Long filenames
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traditional filesystem has directory slots of a fixed 16-byte length,
with 2 bytes for the inode number and 14 bytes for the filename.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BSD FFS defined a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/BSD-4_3_Tahoe-Snapshot-Development/.ref-BSD-4_3/usr/src/sys/h/inode.h#L61-L65&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;more complex directory entry structure&lt;/a&gt;

.
A single entry contains a 4-byte inode number, a 2-byte record length and a 2-byte name length, and then the actual filename.
Filenames are limited to 255 bytes for each pathname component,
and directory entries are rounded up in length to the next 4-byte boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directories are still essentially a linked list, and searching for names in large directories is slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching for free space in directories is now more complicated:
To create a new directory entry, we now need to search through the directory from the start, trying to find a gap in the current structure that is large enough for the name we are being asked to create.
If none is found, the new name is appended at the end, growing the directory in size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free space in directories is never reclaimed through compaction, only eventually re-used if a new name happens to fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;symlinks&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#symlinks&#34;&gt;
	Symlinks
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traditional filesystem allowed a file to have multiple names, using the &lt;code&gt;link()&lt;/code&gt; system call and the hardlink mechanism.
Hardlinks are limited in number (a &lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt;, so 64 K names).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can be lost accidentally, for example, by saving a hardlinked file with certain editors.
If the editor does write a file as &lt;code&gt;filename.new&lt;/code&gt;, then unlinks the old &lt;code&gt;filename&lt;/code&gt; and moves the new file into place, the hardlinked nature of the file will be modified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardlinks also reference the original inode of the file multiple times, so they cannot span filesystem boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BSD introduces a new filetype (&lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt;, symlink), and places a &amp;ldquo;replacement filename&amp;rdquo; in the linked file, which determines the link target location.
It can be an absolute or relative name (relative to the location of the symlink file).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a &amp;ldquo;soft&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;symbolic link.
Trying to access a symlink will kick of a reinterpretation of the filename in &lt;code&gt;namei()&lt;/code&gt; using the replacement filename,
resulting in the attempted &lt;code&gt;open()&lt;/code&gt; system call being deflected to the link target location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the deflection happens in &lt;code&gt;namei()&lt;/code&gt;, which can traverse filesystem boundaries, the new link type is not subject to the single filesystem limitation.
It is also not counting towards any link count limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rename-system-call&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#rename-system-call&#34;&gt;
	Rename System Call
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BSD introduces the &lt;code&gt;rename()&lt;/code&gt; system call, which previously needed to be implemented as a library function using calls to &lt;code&gt;unlink()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;link()&lt;/code&gt;.
Since this uses more than one system call, the operation is not atomic:
It is subject to partial execution, and it is subject to malicious interferences, because it is a multistep process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;quotas&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#quotas&#34;&gt;
	Quotas
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BSD also introduces the idea of filesystem usage quotas:
These are soft and hard limits on the number of files and the amount of disk space that a user or a group can use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to implement them in a useful way, the behavior of the filesystem had to be modified:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is now a privileged operation to change the owner of a file away from oneself.
Without that, it is possible to create a directory that is only accessible for oneself, and then gift all files in it to another user.
The files would then count against that user&amp;rsquo;s quota.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similarly, it is now no longer possible to change the group membership of files to just any group.
Instead, only groups from the user&amp;rsquo;s group set can be used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And finally, new directories and files inherit their group from their parent directory, not from a users primary group.
That way, project directories would contain files counting against a project&amp;rsquo;s quota, not a user&amp;rsquo;s primary group quota.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;advisory-locking&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#advisory-locking&#34;&gt;
	Advisory Locking
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advisory file locking is already introduced in 4.2BSD.
For this, the new &lt;code&gt;flock()&lt;/code&gt; syscall has been implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Locks can be shared (read locks) or exclusive (write locks).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They always apply to the entire file, and not to byte ranges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No deadlock detection is attempted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are tied to a file descriptor.
So when a process dies, its file-handles are automatically closed, which also automatically releases all locks held.
This is very robust, until &lt;code&gt;dup()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; are coming into play.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Posix later tried to improve on this, introducing a second, completely different system of locks, using &lt;code&gt;fcntl()&lt;/code&gt;.
This is flawed in different ways, but can do byte-ranges, and it implements some rudimentary deadlock detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kernels that implement both systems such as Linux now have two different,
incompatible file locking implementations that do not know of each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://loonytek.com/2015/01/15/advisory-file-locking-differences-between-posix-and-bsd-locks/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt;

 discusses all of this some more,
and has example programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;performance&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#performance&#34;&gt;
	Performance
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors note the following advantages in their paper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ls -l&lt;/code&gt; are fast, because the inodes of the files in a single directory are within the same cylinder group.
Hence, reading and listing a directory is very low on seeks, and on seek distance (except for subdirectories, which are guaranteed to be far away).
They measure a 8x speedup for directories without subdirectories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilization of the theoretical maximal bandwidth increased from 3% in the traditional filesystem to 22% or even 47%, depending on the controller hardware used.
The authors are very proud of the results because they have been achieved on an actual production system with real user production data being layouted,
and not on a synthetic benchmark layout. Throughput is stable over the lifetime of the filesystem, as its file population changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This solves the main drivers for the improvements: Better throughput and a stable layout that does not degrade performance over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a number of quality-of-life enhancements have been made, enabling more comfortable working in groups, and unlocking new functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Linux contains no BSD code, the ext2 filesystem is pretty much an implementation-blind rewrite of the BSD FFS for Linux,
recreating the features as described in the literature without using any BSD code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both BSD FFS and Linux ext2 are still non-logging filesystems that require a filesystem check after a crash.
They also cannot deal well with directories with many entries, and deal only slightly better with deep directory hierarchies.
Additional changes are required to enable truly large filesystems in order to keep up with increasing storage sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, other limitations of more hidden nature still apply:
Several places in the filesystem code are guarded by locks that make scaling certain operations hard on systems with high concurrency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would take another ten years, until 1994, for SGI&amp;rsquo;s XFS to tackle these things.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>50 years in filesystems: 1974</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Progress is sometimes hard to see, especially when you have been part of it or otherwise lived through it.
Often, it is easier to see if you compare modern educational material, and the problems discussed with older material.
And then look for the research papers and sources that fueled the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Linux (and Unix in general), this is easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;1974---unix-v7-file-system&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find the Unix Version 7 Research Release in Diomidis Spinellis &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;unix-history-repo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

If we are reading
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/Design-UNIX-Operating-System-Prentice/dp/0132017997&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Design of the Unix Operating System&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is 1974.
Computers have a single &amp;ldquo;core&amp;rdquo;, the central processing unit.
In some computers, this is no longer a device with parts, such as boards for the arithmetic logic unit, registers, sequencers and microcode memory, but a single integrated chip.
The new devices are called microcomputers, as opposed to the older generation of minicomputers.
These new CPUs sometimes have thousands of transistors on a single chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;kernels&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#kernels&#34;&gt;
	Kernels
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Unix, we are dealing with system resources as configured in a header file.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Research-V7-Snapshot-Development/usr/sys/h/param.h&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Default values&lt;/a&gt;


are shown here, and the data structures are arrays, with the values shown being the respective array sizes.
To change them, you edit the file, recompile and relink the kernel, and then reboot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a file system buffer cache using &lt;code&gt;NBUF&lt;/code&gt; (29) disk blocks of 512 bytes.
We have an inode array of &lt;code&gt;NINODE&lt;/code&gt; (200) entries, and we can mount up to &lt;code&gt;NMOUNT&lt;/code&gt; (8) filesystems concurrently.
A user can have &lt;code&gt;MAXUPRC&lt;/code&gt; (25) processes running, for a total of &lt;code&gt;NPROC&lt;/code&gt; (150) system processes.
Each process can have up to &lt;code&gt;NOFILE&lt;/code&gt; (20) files open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading Bach and the original V7 sources is interesting, despite the fact that things are completely outdated, because a lot of core concepts are much clearer,
and a lot of structures are a lot simpler.
Sometimes even archaic.
But this is what defines the behavior of Unix File Systems, to this day, because the accidental behavior of V7 Unix became immortalized in the POSIX standard,
and every file system after had to conform to it.
Check &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2018/11/29/but-is-it-atomic.html#source-dive-why-are-writes-atomic&#34;&gt;But Is It Atomic?&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic concepts and structures of Unix Filesystems are from this time, and from this system.
Some of them exist even in modern systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disk is an array of blocks. It begins at block 0, and stretches to block n.
At the beginning of the filesystem we find the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Research-V7-Snapshot-Development/usr/sys/h/filsys.h&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;superblock&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The in-memory superblock has fields for an array of inodes (a &lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt;) on disk.

 is a structure that describes a file as a variable length array of blocks, and some metadata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;#define	INOPB	8	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt;/* 8 inodes per block */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt; */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The inode as it appears on disk. 8 inodes fit into a 512-byte disk block, so they are aligned at 64 byte boundaries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inode array on the filesystem has a &lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt; count, so there can be up to 65535 inodes in a filesystem.
As each file requires an inode, there can only be that many files per filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each file has some fixed properties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(2 bytes) a &lt;code&gt;mode&lt;/code&gt; (the file type and access permissions combined).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(2 bytes) a link count (&lt;code&gt;nlink&lt;/code&gt;), the number of names this file has.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(2 bytes) a &lt;code&gt;uid&lt;/code&gt;, the owner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(2 bytes) a &lt;code&gt;gid&lt;/code&gt;, the owner&amp;rsquo;s group id.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(4 bytes) a &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt;, the length of the file in bytes (defined as an &lt;code&gt;off_t&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(40 bytes) an &lt;code&gt;addr&lt;/code&gt; array of disk block addresses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(3x 4 bytes) three times, an &lt;code&gt;atime&lt;/code&gt; (access time), &lt;code&gt;mtime&lt;/code&gt; (modification time) and &lt;code&gt;ctime&lt;/code&gt; (supposedly create time, but really the time of the last inode change).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for a total size of 64 bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bmap&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#bmap&#34;&gt;
	bmap()
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;addr&lt;/code&gt; array contains 40 bytes, but it stores 13 disk block addresses, each using 3 bytes.
This is good for 24 bits, or 16 megablocks of 512 bytes, each, for a total filesystem size of 8M kilobytes, or 8 GB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Front panel of a PDP-11 RL02 disk drive, from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pdp-11.nl/peripherals/disk/rl-info.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;pdp-11.nl&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison, a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pdp-11.nl/peripherals/disk/rl-info.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;PDP-11 RL02K disk cartridge&lt;/a&gt;

 held 10.4 MB,
but the newer &lt;a href=&#34;https://lastin.dti.supsi.ch/VET/disks/RA92/EK-ORA90-UG.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;RA92&lt;/a&gt;

 could store 1.5 GB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;addr&lt;/code&gt; array is being used in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Research-V7-Snapshot-Development/usr/sys/sys/subr.c#L9-L120&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;bmap() function&lt;/a&gt;

.
The function consumes an inode (&lt;code&gt;ip&lt;/code&gt;) and a logical block number &lt;code&gt;bn&lt;/code&gt; and returns a physical block number.
That is, it maps a block in a file to a block on a disk, hence the name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first 10-block pointers are stored directly in the inode.
That is, to access for example block 0, &lt;code&gt;bmap()&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Research-V7-Snapshot-Development/usr/sys/sys/subr.c#L40&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;will look up&lt;/a&gt;

 &lt;code&gt;di_addr[0]&lt;/code&gt; in the inode and return this block number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional blocks are stored in an indirect block, and the indirect block is stored in the inode.
For even larger files, a double indirect block is allocated, and points to more indirect blocks, and finally very large files need even triple indirect blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Research-V7-Snapshot-Development/usr/sys/sys/subr.c#L60-L73&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;first determines the number of indirections&lt;/a&gt;

,
grab the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Research-V7-Snapshot-Development/usr/sys/sys/subr.c#L78&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;appropriate indirect block&lt;/a&gt;

,
and then &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Research-V7-Snapshot-Development/usr/sys/sys/subr.c#L91-L112&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;resolve the indirection&lt;/a&gt;

 the appropriate number of times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This results in the following famous picture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/1994/02/filestructure.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original Unix file structure with increasing numbers of indirect accesses for increasingly larger files.
This forms a compressed array, where short files can be accessed directly with data from the inode, whereas larger files are using increasingly indirect access.
For performance, it is crucial to keep indirect blocks in the file system buffer cache.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How this scales is dependent on the block size (512 bytes back then, 4096 bytes these days), and the size of a block number in bytes (originally 3 bytes, later 4 or even 8 bytes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;atomic-writes&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#atomic-writes&#34;&gt;
	Atomic writes
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writes to files happen under a lock, so they are always atomic.
This is true even for long writes, which span multiple block boundaries, and is discussed at length in
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2018/11/29/but-is-it-atomic.html#source-dive-why-are-writes-atomic&#34;&gt;But Is It Atomic?&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also means that even with multiple writer processes, on a single file there can be only ever one disk write active at any point in time.
This is very inconvenient for authors of database systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;	&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;	&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;d_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;DIRSIZ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A directory entry contains an inode number (an &lt;code&gt;unsigned int&lt;/code&gt;), and a filename which can be up to 14 bytes long. This fits 32 directory entries into a disk block, and 320 directory entries into the 10 disks blocks that can being referenced by the direct blocks of a directory file.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower filesystem is a sea of files.
Files have no names, only numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upper filesystem uses a special type of file, with a simple 16-byte record structure,
to assign a name of up to 14 characters to a file.
A special function, &lt;code&gt;namei()&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Research-V7-Snapshot-Development/usr/sys/sys/nami.c#L9-L200&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;converts a filename into an inode number&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathnames passed to &lt;code&gt;namei()&lt;/code&gt; are hierarchical:
they can contain &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; as a path separator, and they are being terminated by &lt;code&gt;\0 (nul)&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Research-V7-Snapshot-Development/usr/sys/sys/nami.c#L37-L41&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Pathnames&lt;/a&gt;

 either start with &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;,
in which case the traversal begins at the filesystem root, making the filename absolute.
Or they do not, in which case traversal starts at &lt;code&gt;u.u_cdir&lt;/code&gt;, the current directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The function then consumes pathname component after component,
using the currently active directory and searching linearly for the name of the current component in that directory.
It ends when the last pathname component is found, or if at any stage a component is not found.
It also ends,
if at any point in time, for any directory in the path,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Research-V7-Snapshot-Development/usr/sys/sys/nami.c#L91&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;we have no x-permission&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Research-V7-Snapshot-Development/usr/sys/sys/nami.c#L179&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Some entries are magical&lt;/a&gt;

:
They are mountpoints.
When we encounter them, we change from the directory entry of the current node and filesystem to the root inode of the mounted filesystem.
This makes all filesystems in Unix appear as a single tree, and &amp;ldquo;drives are changed&amp;rdquo; by simply going to a different directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The function ultimately returns a pointer to the inode for the given pathname, creating (or deleting) the inode (and directory entry) if necessary and desired.
It is a centralized point for directory traversal and access permission checks.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This very early Unix filesystem has a number of very nice properties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It presents multiple filesystems as one single unified tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Files are structureless arrays of bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These arrays are stored internally in a variable depth dynamic array, using a system of increasingly deeply nested indirect blocks.
This allows O(1) disk seeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower filesystem (creating files) and upper filesystem (structuring files into a tree) are clearly separated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathname traversal is the only way to get an inode, and along the way permissions are always checked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are very few characters in filenames that are special, &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;\0 (nul)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have clear limitations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Files can only have 16M blocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filesystems can only have 65535 inodes, which is very limited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there are a number of annoying limitations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There can be only one writer active per file, which kills concurrency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directory lookups are linear scans, so they become very slow for large directories (more than 320 entries).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no system for mandatory file locking.
There are several systems for advisory file locking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a few quirks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no &lt;code&gt;delete()&lt;/code&gt; system call.
We have &lt;code&gt;unlink()&lt;/code&gt;, which removes a file name,
and files that have zero names and zero open file handles are being automatically collected.
This has a few unusual consequences,
for example, disk space is only freed if a completely unlinked file is also completely closed.
Generations of Unix sysadmins have asked where their disk space is,
when a deleted log file in &lt;code&gt;/var/log&lt;/code&gt; was still kept open by some forgotten process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially there is no &lt;code&gt;mkdir()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rmdir()&lt;/code&gt; system call, which leads to exploitable race conditions.
This is fixed in later versions of Unix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few operations that are accidentally atomic (like the write(2) system call), or have been made atomic after they have been exploited (&lt;code&gt;mknod(2)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mkdir(2)&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structurally, it is annoying that the inode table and free maps for blocks and inodes are at the beginning of the filesystem, and disk space is allocated linearly from the front of the disk, too.
This leads to a seek intense structure, and enables filesystem fragmentation (in which files are being stored in non-adjacent blocks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traversing a directory structure means reading a directories inode at the beginning of the disk,
going to the data blocks further back,
then reading the next inode of the next pathname component from the beginning of the disk,
and going back the data blocks in the back.
This goes back and forth, once for each pathname component, and is not necessarily fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;today-and-improvements&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#today-and-improvements&#34;&gt;
	Today, and Improvements
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PDP-11 V7 Unix filesystem got a faithful reimplementation as the  &lt;code&gt;minix&lt;/code&gt; filesystem, with all its limitations.
In modern Linux, it has been removed from the kernel source tree because it is no longer useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will see in a later article about the BSD fast filesystem, how the data can be better layouted on disk,
how we can implement longer filenames, more inodes, and how we can speed things up a bit by taking physical properties of the disk into account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only even newer filesystems will be dealing with linear directory lookup times, single writers or limited file metadata.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tracing Python</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/03/14/tracing-python.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Mar 2023 12:13:14 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/03/14/tracing-python.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Based on a discussion on IRC and Mastodon: &amp;ldquo;How can I get access to the return values of my (Python-) programs functions?&amp;rdquo;
And more generally, how can I trace function execution in Python, showing function parameters and return values?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;pycharm-builtin-method&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#pycharm-builtin-method&#34;&gt;
	PyCharm builtin method
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can always simply turn on this in the PyCharm debugger:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/03/python-tracing-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PyCharm, Debug Window, Gear Icon, &amp;ldquo;Show Return Values&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;do-it-yourself-logging&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#do-it-yourself-logging&#34;&gt;
	Do it yourself: @logging
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also implement such a thing from first principles, in Python:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;functools&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;args_to_str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;kwargs_to_str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ret&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ow&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ret&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;sa&#34;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;,&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes use of &lt;code&gt;@functools.wraps()&lt;/code&gt; to define a &lt;a href=&#34;https://python101.pythonlibrary.org/chapter25_decorators.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;decorator&lt;/a&gt;

, &lt;code&gt;@logging&lt;/code&gt;.
It also leverages the fact, that anything, including a callable, can have properties, which we are using to maintain an indent count in &lt;code&gt;func.__indent__&lt;/code&gt;.
This is initialized to 0, and then incremented by 2 for each call in the call stack. Unwinding the call stack resets the counter, so we don&amp;rsquo;t have to do that manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have two helper functions to turn the functions &lt;code&gt;*args&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;**kwargs&lt;/code&gt; into proper strings, and we access &lt;code&gt;func.__qualname__&lt;/code&gt; to get the functions &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-qualified-name&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;name&lt;/a&gt;

.
We are using &lt;code&gt;__qualname__&lt;/code&gt; to handle inner functions properly here, even if that is sometimes creating less readable output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running the code results in&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Output from the Python program above shows function calls and results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mzipay/Autologging&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;autologging&lt;/a&gt;

 package makes this simpler, even if it lacks the nice indentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our code becomes much shorter:&lt;/p&gt;

After setting up a log channel with proper formatting, we can mark functions with the decorator, get their execution traced and can simply log.&lt;/p&gt;

	Using &lt;code&gt;icecream&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point Andreas Thienemann mentioned &lt;code&gt;icecream&lt;/code&gt;, which is remarkable comfortable.
Versions of &lt;code&gt;icecream&lt;/code&gt; exist for many programming languages, so this is not Python specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;icecream&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ic&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;configureOutput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;includeContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;fac&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;bp&#34;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;bp&#34;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;fac&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;vm&#34;&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;__main__&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Fac&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;fac&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icecream defined a function &lt;code&gt;ic()&lt;/code&gt;, which you can call with parameters (&lt;code&gt;ic(n)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ic(1)&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;ic(n * self.fac(n - 1))&lt;/code&gt;), or without (&lt;code&gt;ic()&lt;/code&gt;).
The function will print its parameters, just like a debug print, or when called without parameters, just log its execution including source file and line.
Options to prettify the output exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The package also provides a function &lt;code&gt;install()&lt;/code&gt;, which will simply make &lt;code&gt;ic()&lt;/code&gt; available as a builtin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;icecream&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ic&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# this basically does builtin.ic = ic&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# ic() is now available in all your modules &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# without having to include it in every submodule.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The output looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/03/python-tracing-04.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Running our code with &lt;code&gt;icecream&lt;/code&gt; produces this output, nicely colorized and pretty printed.
We enabled &lt;code&gt;includeContext=True&lt;/code&gt;, so we also get file names and line numbers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;snoop-and-birdseye&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#snoop-and-birdseye&#34;&gt;
	&lt;code&gt;snoop&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;birdseye&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is not the end of it.
The package &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/alexmojaki/snoop&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;snoop&lt;/a&gt;

 provides tracing of one or all functions,
comes with its own version of icecream called &lt;code&gt;pp&lt;/code&gt; (PrettyPrint).
Using &lt;code&gt;pp.deep()&lt;/code&gt;, it will show expression evaluation step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;snoop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;pp&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;pp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;deep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;logs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;12:34:56.78 LOG:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;12:34:56.78 ............ x = 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;12:34:56.78 ........ x + 1 = 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;12:34:56.78 ................ y = 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;12:34:56.78 ............ y + 2 = 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;12:34:56.78 ................ y = 2

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;12:34:56.78 ........ max(y + 2, y + 3) = 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;12:34:56.78 .... x + 1 + max(y + 2, y + 3) = 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snoop understands Python:
It shows not just file numbers, but actual code call context, parameters.
It handles debugging Decorators, can log Exceptions properly, and can log call stacks of a configurable depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the examples in the link above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/alexmojaki/birdseye&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;birdseye&lt;/a&gt;

 is a continuation of &lt;code&gt;snoop&lt;/code&gt; to the extreme, and integrated with it.
It captures the same data as &lt;code&gt;snoop&lt;/code&gt;, but logs it to a SQLite file in your &lt;code&gt;$HOME&lt;/code&gt;.
It will then allow you to start a &lt;code&gt;flask&lt;/code&gt;-based Webserver on port 7777 to evaluate the trace file and replay it step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;@spy&lt;/code&gt; allows you to run &lt;code&gt;snoop&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;birdseye&lt;/code&gt; in tandem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;birdseye&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;eye&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;snoop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;snoop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;spy&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;vm&#34;&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;__main__&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;fac&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sa&#34;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;=}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will instrument the code to run with &lt;code&gt;snoop&lt;/code&gt;, and also log into the database file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trace is pretty:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/03/python-tracing-05.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Output of &lt;code&gt;snoop&lt;/code&gt; running on our test function. We instrumented with &lt;code&gt;@spy&lt;/code&gt;, which will also create a trace file.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running the Birdseye decoder is easy: &lt;code&gt;python -m birdeye&lt;/code&gt; will start it on the default port, &lt;code&gt;7777&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/03/python-tracing-06.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starting the &lt;code&gt;birdseye&lt;/code&gt; web server to serve trace files. It is bound to localhost, and listens by default on Port &lt;code&gt;7777&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rendered trace looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/03/python-tracing-07.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;birdseye&lt;/code&gt; webserver showing a trace. You can click through the program execution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;peepshow-a-commandline-debugger&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#peepshow-a-commandline-debugger&#34;&gt;
	&lt;code&gt;peepshow&lt;/code&gt;, a commandline debugger
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The package &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gergelyk/peepshow&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;peepshow&lt;/a&gt;

 then offers a full scale commandline debugger, which allows you to trace program execution, set breakpoints and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it has been abandoned (the last commit was in November 2020), and does not support modern Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;honeycomb-and-opentracing&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#honeycomb-and-opentracing&#34;&gt;
	Honeycomb and Opentracing
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you cannot access the host your code runs on, for example, because that host is variable and many, because you are running in Kubernetes?
In this case, Honeycomb and other OpenTelemetry packages have you covered.
They do the same logging as above, but package data in OpenTelemetry Spans, and send these over the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old, original Honeycomb Beeline for Python is documented here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.honeycomb.io/getting-data-in/beeline/python/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Python Beeline&lt;/a&gt;

.
The current OTel compatible implementation is here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.honeycomb.io/getting-data-in/opentelemetry/python/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;OTel replacement&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A medium article discussion the same decorator usage as we do here, but in the context of OpenTelemetry, is available:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://digma.ai/blog/using-decorators-to-instrument-python-code-with-opentelemetry-traces/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Using Decorators to Instrument Python Code With OpenTelemetry Traces&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;and-in-c&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#and-in-c&#34;&gt;
	And in C?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar solution exists for the C programming language since 1987, in the form of the Fred Fish Debug Macros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the usage &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/blob/1bfe02bdad6604d54913c62614bde57a055c8332/mysys/list.cc#L44-L56&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;in MySQL&lt;/a&gt;

,
and grab &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/blob/1bfe02bdad6604d54913c62614bde57a055c8332/mysys/dbug.cc&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;the source&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is older than time itself, and C is a bit limited compared to Python, but it basically does the same thing, in 36 years old code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code for these samples has been made avialable &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/isotopp/logging-experiments&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>MySQL: Selecting random rows</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/03/06/selecting-random-rows.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Feb 2023 12:13:14 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/03/06/selecting-random-rows.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Given a table named &lt;code&gt;tbl&lt;/code&gt; with one million entries, we want to select a random row from this table, fast.
Our table definition looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-mysql&#34; data-lang=&#34;mysql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;tbl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;INTEGER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;VARCHAR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;INDEX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;dense-id-space&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#dense-id-space&#34;&gt;
	Dense &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; space
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can generate some test data using a recursive CTE:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-mysql&#34; data-lang=&#34;mysql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cte_max_recursion_depth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;100000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;insert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;into&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;tbl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;recursive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;uuid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;union&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;uuid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;100000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Recursive CTE will generate 100k pairs of (number, uuid()).
The initial row is defined in the upper row of the &lt;code&gt;UNION&lt;/code&gt;, each subsequent row builds recursively on top of that, by simply counting up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we generate all the values in one transaction, the &lt;code&gt;uuid()&lt;/code&gt; is actually static.
That is, because inside a transaction time stops, and the uuid is internally time-based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;-space is free of gaps, we have &lt;code&gt;rng&lt;/code&gt; many numbers between &lt;code&gt;min(id) as min&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;max(id) as max&lt;/code&gt;.
Using the index on &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;, we can simply generate a random number between these boundaries and select the row.&lt;/p&gt;

We cannot use Window functions in any interesting context, and using them in a subquery basically forces the database to materialize all the rows before the one we are interested in.
So this is slow:&lt;/p&gt;

	Selecting randomly from tables with gaps
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without continuous ids, and without a row count we cannot easily select the &amp;ldquo;n-th record&amp;rdquo; from a table.
So the best we can do is to select all &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;-values, and shuffle them, then choose the first row from the shuffle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-mysql&#34; data-lang=&#34;mysql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;tbl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;order&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;rand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;limit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

	Consuming rows
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the previous examples, we have been re-ordering the table randomly for each access (or group of accesses).
The shuffle has not been made persistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, the problem is not to select a random row, but to consume rows in random order.
We can store a random number with each row, and then use this as an (indexed) ordering key.
Using the knowledge from
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/07/13/mysql-a-job-queue-in-python.html&#34;&gt;the queueing article&lt;/a&gt;

,
we can select the item with the highest ordering value, lock it for consumption, retrieve it and delete it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is to add a column &lt;code&gt;ordering&lt;/code&gt; to our table, indexed for fast access.
The &lt;code&gt;ordering&lt;/code&gt; value is assigned randomly.
Here, we are creating the values after the fact in batch for one million entries, but in a system you would probably do that for each item as you write the item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;actual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;processing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;outside&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;transaction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, the inner query determines the maximum &amp;ldquo;ordering&amp;rdquo; value, which is fast due to the index.
We make use of that value to fetch &amp;ldquo;a row&amp;rdquo;.
Nothing prevents multiple rows from matching, so we may get one or more rows.
We take the first (or all values), process it, and delete the processed rows, then commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we use &lt;code&gt;FOR UPDATE&lt;/code&gt;, each row we select will also be exclusively locked, so other consumers cannot touch them.
Because of the &lt;code&gt;SKIP LOCKED&lt;/code&gt;, other consumers will not be hanging on locked rows.
Instead, they will simply not see locked rows, so our query may actually even return zero rows in a concurrent context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you do not strictly process items in order, and want to process them &amp;ldquo;roughly&amp;rdquo; in order, but be able to leverage multiple consumers.
A query such as the one below selects one or more items to process (locking them), so that they can be picked up for processing and deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-mysql&#34; data-lang=&#34;mysql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;transaction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;actual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;processing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;outside&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;transaction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For scalability, it is important to keep the interval between &lt;code&gt;START TRANSACTION&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;COMMIT&lt;/code&gt; as short as possible.
Therefore, it is advisable to keep the actual item processing outside the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we do not need to shuffle things each time when we access things, this is actually much faster than &amp;ldquo;selecting a random row&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rotating Accounts or Passwords?</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/02/20/rotating-accounts-or-passwords.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some applications allow you to have multiple passwords.
For example, in &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/password-management.html#dual-passwords&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MySQL, since 8.0.14 you can dual passwords for an account&lt;/a&gt;

.
Also, &lt;a href=&#34;https://redis.io/docs/management/security/acl/#create-and-edit-user-acls-with-the-acl-setuser-command&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Redis 6 allows you to have multiple passwords on an account ACL&lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#personal-accounts-and-machine-accounts&#34;&gt;
	Personal Accounts and Machine Accounts.
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When running services in a production system, the services sometimes have personal accounts (PAs) that allow humans to login and perform actions on the service.
Often, these accounts are very limited in number (in production), and privileged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, you have clients connecting to the system.
These are called Non-Personal Accounts, Machine Accounts or Service Accounts (MA) in many environments.
Machine Accounts are not used by humans, but are a set of credentials used by client applications to work with a service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is good practice to assign a different MA to each application using a service,  and to rotate credentials regularly and quickly for each MA.
In many environments doing this is even a compliance requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;different-usernames-are-helpful&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#different-usernames-are-helpful&#34;&gt;
	Different Usernames are helpful
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assigning different identities (different usernames) to different applications is useful in many ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access permissions are tied to identities, so different identities are a requirement to separate different sets of permissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, different identities allow you to attribute activity in the service to the identity, thus make monitoring, auditing and accounting possible.
It is much easier to identify a misbehaving application, if all applications using your service have different user account names.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;dynamically-assigned-credentials&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#dynamically-assigned-credentials&#34;&gt;
	Dynamically assigned credentials
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very often credentials are not stored at all in the client configuration, but are requested dynamically on-demand from another service, the Secrets Manager or Vault.
It is either part of a cloud control plane, and can leverage trust from the cloud infrastructure to know who is who and what to allow,
or it is an external service such as a Hashicorp Vault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, the application would not store Database or Redis username and passwords in configuration files any more,
but ask the secrets manager to provide these credentials at runtime, receive them, and then store them only in memory.
They would also be expired and re-requested in regular intervals, on a multiple-minutes to hour scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allows the Secrets Manager to perform account operations, such as password or account rotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;account-rotation-or-password-rotation&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#account-rotation-or-password-rotation&#34;&gt;
	Account Rotation or Password Rotation?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rotating MA passwords is often a requirement, and most environments also require a comparatively high rotation frequency (&amp;ldquo;once per week&amp;rdquo;, which qualifies as &amp;ldquo;high&amp;rdquo; in database timescales).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some services, such as MySQL and Redis given as examples above, allow you to associate multiple password with a single account.
Many others do not, in them username (&amp;ldquo;identity&amp;rdquo;) and password (&amp;ldquo;authentication&amp;rdquo;) are a 2-tuple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rotating passwords, when taken literally, is hard with such services, because changing the password atomically in the server and all its clients is impossible.
There is always some overlap during which the service already has the new password (and implicitly invalidated the old password),
while the clients are still using the old password.
If you rotated the password with traditional methods, there would be a discrepancy between clients and servers in password knowledge, and thus failed logins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way around that is provisioning new MA accounts for an application, and then feeding the applications not only new passwords, but completely new credentials.
Thus,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an application &lt;code&gt;androidapp&lt;/code&gt; would see the old user &lt;code&gt;androidapp_23ad63&lt;/code&gt; with a generated password &lt;code&gt;BBLA32Tm9feoAGpN&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then account rotation would additionally create &lt;code&gt;androidapp_8760d3&lt;/code&gt; with the password &lt;code&gt;cts6Me5c7T4q6Dq2&lt;/code&gt; and the same authorizations in the service,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then the account rotation would test that this newly creates account works as desired,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then the account rotation would stop handing out the old credentials (&lt;code&gt;23ad63&lt;/code&gt;) to clients, and start serving the new credentials (&lt;code&gt;8760d3&lt;/code&gt;),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then the account rotation would over the course of an hour observe the old account not being used anymore, and the new account picking up traffic,
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then the account rotation would see the old &lt;code&gt;23ad63&lt;/code&gt; account being silent for two hours, and eventually lock and deprovision it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or this does not work as expected, and &lt;code&gt;23ad63&lt;/code&gt; stays active past the deadline, in which case we raise an alarm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-no-observability&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#why-no-observability&#34;&gt;
	Why no observability?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Account rotation has some advantages over password rotation:
First: it works with any application, even those that have no support for multiple passwords.
Lack of multiple password support is stopping no-one from implementing rotation, it is just account and not password rotation you need to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then:
Even in MySQL and Redis it was not immediately obvious to me how password rotation can be validated to function correctly.
That is, I have been unable to find a way to isolate instances of logins using the &amp;ldquo;non-primary&amp;rdquo; (or old) password, and somehow make sure that all logins in the last hour or so have been using the newly updated password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an engineer running the application, I would want to make sure that the old password is unused before I ask the service to deprovision it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But observability on this seems to be completely non-existent.
Which is weird, because any security engineer will tell you that a control is only valid, if you can verify it is working as intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With account rotation, usage of old accounts is immediately visible.
The system can check if the old account is still being used, and once it isn&amp;rsquo;t anymore, it can deprovision it.
If the old account does not go silent within some timeout, we can alert on this, identity the team responsible for the application, and sit down to talk about credential caching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, I would rate the implementation of any password rotation feature that does not have good observability built in as incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-authorization-problem&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#an-authorization-problem&#34;&gt;
	An authorization problem
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, while account rotation has automatically good observability, it complicates authorisation.
Authorisation is the set of permissions ties to an identity, the &lt;code&gt;GRANT&lt;/code&gt;s in SQL-lingo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you rotate accounts, you are essentially creating new accounts and drop old accounts on a schedule.
That means&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;either store the authorization outside the system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or you can leverage a role system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latter case, you would create a role &lt;code&gt;androidapp&lt;/code&gt;, and assign it the authorizations, then make sure all &lt;code&gt;androidapp%&lt;/code&gt; accounts are members of the role, inheriting the role authorizations with no individual per-account rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most, but not all systems have a role-system for accounts similar to MySQL 8 roles, in which you assign authorizations to groups instead of individual accounts.
If you have it, implementing account rotation without complicating authorization is comparatively easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#summary&#34;&gt;
	Summary
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having a secrets manager that hands out secrets to services and clients is useful, because it allows you to prevent materialization of secrets.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the primary features of clouds (private and public) would be that the control-plane of the cloud can attest identity of instances, and would allow you to solve authentication trivially.
Sadly, Openstack and all Openstack derives private and public clouds seem to not implement that (and thus offer no IAM to services based on control-plane trust).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For those where the cloud control-plane does not offer IAM, Hashivault can help out a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some applications have the ability to have multiple passwords per identity, to allow easier password rotation.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The value of that feature is greatly diminished by a lack of observability. Any control is only complete if it can be verified to work.
We need to be able to see if old deprecated passwords are unused in order to safely deprovision them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even without multiple passwords, we can always leverage a secrets manager and some relatively simple external driver to rotate accounts instead.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is complicated by the fact that many applications bind authorizations (access permissions) to identities (usernames).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can use roles to work around that, and assign authorizations to these roles, then have the identity inherit from the role.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementing either account rotation or password rotation still requires additional work: an external driver, safeguards, monitoring and alerting, plus an update of the documentation.
In neither case you will be done by simply turning on a feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>This is not a Drill, this is just Tuesday</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/02/18/this-is-not-a-drill.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Feb 2023 06:07:08 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/02/18/this-is-not-a-drill.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;master-of-disaster&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#master-of-disaster&#34;&gt;
	Master of Disaster
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a previous employer there was the requirement to implement business continuity management and patch management.
Specifically, there was a requirement to be able to lose a region completely without loss of business.
The other requirement was to be able to have all systems CVE-free within 30 days (in emergencies: 3 days), and to be able to blackstart them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was of course impossible to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managements reaction was to create the position of the &amp;ldquo;Master of Disaster&amp;rdquo; (MoD).
The MoD and their apprentice (&amp;ldquo;always two there are&amp;rdquo;) have then planned, for many months, a fail-over between two Regions.
But they did not achieve much, and they never could, because in the end Management Buy-In was missing.
In the end, Management wanted to know (needed to know!), before the test, that it would work.
That of course invalidated this approach completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;security-is-a-process-what-does-that-even-mean&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#security-is-a-process-what-does-that-even-mean&#34;&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Security is a process&amp;rdquo;, what does that even mean?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MoD then changed their way of working completely.
They sat down with the teams, and with each they made a catalog of failure modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What happens when a web server node fails?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;What happens when ten web server nodes fail?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;What happens when a load balancer dies?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;What when a rollout rolls out broken code, and we need to roll back?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;What when storage fails?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the MoD sat down and worked their way through protocols of past outages.
They cataloged the outages and mapped then to the scenarios created above, and if they found missing cases the catalog was extended, together with the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;it-is-only-science-if-you-write-it-down&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#it-is-only-science-if-you-write-it-down&#34;&gt;
	It is only science if you write it down
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the team was asked to predict what would happen, how they would notice and how to fix.
The MoD made them write these things down, into Opdocs.
The Opdocs got Identifiers.
All scenarios had to have named alarms checking for the scenario, and each alarm message had to include the Opdoc ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the team created a test scenario for each of these outages, bundled them together into a test session (&amp;ldquo;a drill&amp;rdquo;).
And together with the Master of Disaster, their apprentice and a scribe went through them one by one, writing down what happened.
Afterwards, all sat down, and compared notes with the predictions, and made a set of tasks to update the Alarms, the Opdocs or the Procedures themselves.
Then they scheduled a followup session.
In the end they arrived at a rhythm of a Drill every two or three sprints, until the team and the MoD were satisfied with the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;rinse-repeat&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#rinse-repeat&#34;&gt;
	Rinse, Repeat
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MoD did that with all the teams, and magically after a year or so, things were no longer painful, but became a way of operating.
The observed failure modes of the systems changed, because Drill findings made their way into development.
The way of working and the way of thinking changed, in all the teams, fundamentally, even.
Alerts became cleaned up, and with the need to attach Opdocs, Alerts became actionable, because that is what is in an Opdoc:
Packaged actions a relatively unskilled Operator can execute.
Tooling improved, to automate previously manual outage procedures.
Automation grew.
Reliability and reproducibility improved.
Metrics got better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;large-scale-outages&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#large-scale-outages&#34;&gt;
	Large scale outages
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the MoD moved on from team-level subsystem failures to larger scenarios that simulated loss of Racks or other larger units, or loss of Network connectivity (intermittently or for longer time).
Also, they added drill scenarios with a loss of storage, that is outages where teams did not get back the machine that was simulated to fail after the Drill.
Instead, they had to create replacements, first individually, then had to black-start entire regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These Drills highlighted automation defects:
Manual and often undocumented work went into creating new systems, so that the automation was not resilient against large scale loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, a lot of problems related to loss or unavailability of the automation control plane were highlighted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systems might be able to lose their automation controllers.
This is a &amp;ldquo;loss of control&amp;rdquo; scenario, not &amp;ldquo;loss of availability&amp;rdquo;.
You do not lose web servers, but you lose the ability to make new ones or to decommission old ones or change the config of the existing ones.
Systems usually can continue to run without their automation controller for a few hours, provided the operational circumstances are somewhat stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, loss of state in the control plane highlighted that the control plan could not rediscover its clients out there and scan them for state.
Instead, it was assumed that the entire region was to be recreated from scratch, when it was in fact there, and perfectly functional, just unknown to the controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases the automation assumed that new systems were to be recreated from scratch by cloning over data from remote regions.
But if all teams are doing that at the same time, the line capacity is insufficient.
It is necessary to do something more sophisticated and use local state (cloned over once) to implement a local fan-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, a year or two went past, with limited scope but larger drills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teams picked up the new requirements, development learned a thing or two, and by simply repeating until good the message arrived and improvements got implemented.
We have now reached a state where automation is only considered &amp;ldquo;done done&amp;rdquo; when it survives one of the regularly simulated outages,
and when the state of the Opdocs is good enough for members of adjacent teams (instead of the native team) to manage the outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, we have reached a sophistication of automation that allows us to drop each and ever instance and each and every image after 90 days,
because replacements are redeployed automatically, and state is cloned over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;burning-it-all-down&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#burning-it-all-down&#34;&gt;
	Burning it all down
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, after only three to four years, is where our organisation has reached a state where teams and management can go with confidence into a scenario where access to one Region is lost, in a controlled way and with pre-announcement.
Management can believe that the entire thing is understood well enough that this Drill will not lead of a major loss of income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unannounced random failure of a Region, or total recovery from backup after a ransomware attack are still open issues, but they have become realistic targets.
Each would amount to rebuilding a Region, automatically, from nothing, without loss of operations or income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;this-is-not-a-sprint&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#this-is-not-a-sprint&#34;&gt;
	This is not a Sprint
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/02/not-a-drill.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to success for the MoD was the change from Project to Process.
Do small things with individual teams, first with cooperative teams, then reaching out and making the process mandatory for all teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was not a single giant monster project, but small steps over many years, with a change in the MoD position and with a redefinition of the title and scope of the position along the way.
It also was a fundamental change in the way how operations are done, and what is acceptable.
It improved not only the business continuity stance, but also improved security overall, and made many audits and certifications easier.
It also delivered the necessary metadata (machine inventory, mapping of services to instances, mapping of dependencies, implementation of controls) to management to make a large set of certifications and audits just a formality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people say &amp;ldquo;Security is a process&amp;rdquo;, this is what they mean.
Small, doable exercises that become part of everyday operations.
Then incremental widening of scope and increase of difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the work is not done by the MoD, but by the teams &amp;ndash; all teams.
The MoD only steers the process, and guides the teams through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this is not a Drill.
This is just Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The server in question has 32 GB of memory (6 GB used), 8 cores, and processes threads running.
It is mostly idle.
There is no reason at all why this machine should be out of resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;vps-limits-and-how-to-check-them&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#vps-limits-and-how-to-check-them&#34;&gt;
	VPS Limits, and how to check them
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a VPS, and that may be related:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; lscpu &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; egrep -i &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;(visor|virt)&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;Address sizes:       46 bits physical, 48 bits virtual
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;Virtualization:      VT-x
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;Hypervisor vendor:   Parallels
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;Virtualization type: container
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The instance has a relatively low process limit, shown in &lt;code&gt;/proc/user_beancounters&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; grep numproc /proc/user_beancounters
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;            numproc                       272                  272                 1100                 1100                    0
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shows a global limit of 1100 threads/processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an additional threads-per-process limit enforced by systemd, and this is relatively low, because of the low per-instance limit.
It can be shown like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; systemctl show --property&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;DefaultTasksMax
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;DefaultMax=135
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This matches the numbers from the &lt;code&gt;user_beancounters&lt;/code&gt;:
The maximum utilization was 272 in the Beancounters, and the server never managed to hit the limit of 1100.
Instead, it made it to 2x 135 (two Minecraft servers, each with the limit of 135), and two additional threads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;increasing-the-systemd-limit&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#increasing-the-systemd-limit&#34;&gt;
	Increasing the &lt;code&gt;systemd&lt;/code&gt; Limit
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to increase this limit to the instance limit, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; mkdir /etc/systemd/systemd.conf.d&lt;span class=&#34;sb&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; /etc/systemd/system.conf.d
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;pwd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;/etc/systemd/system.conf.d
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; cat &amp;lt;&amp;lt; EOF &amp;gt; system.conf
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Override created by ... on ...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;Manager&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;DefaultTasksMax=1100
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After creating this file, reload systemd and check the new limits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; systemctl daemon-reexec
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; systemctl show --property&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;DefaultTasksMax
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;DefaultMax=1100
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;non-vps-has-higher-limits&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#non-vps-has-higher-limits&#34;&gt;
	Non-VPS has higher limits
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a physical server with 32 GB of memory and 8 cores, the default limit is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; systemctl show --property&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;DefaultTasksMax
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;DefaultTasksMax=38313
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;and it can be tuned much higher.
Similarly, on a properly virtualized box instead of a VPS it would be much higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this when you opt for a cheap, overcomitted VPS slice instead of a proper KVM.
When you go for the VPS, make a monthly contract and do not commit to a one-year option, so you can get rid of it when it turns out to be unsuitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;actual-resource-consumption&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#actual-resource-consumption&#34;&gt;
	Actual resource consumption
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our server, we run three instances of &amp;ldquo;Paper&amp;rdquo; (a high-performance patch to a patch to a patch of the original minecraft server),
and waterfall, a Minecraft proxy that directs users between the instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/02/native-thread-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Output of the &lt;code&gt;htop&lt;/code&gt; program.
On the right hand side of the screenshot, we see three identically configured &lt;code&gt;java&lt;/code&gt; instances, each representing a &amp;ldquo;Paper&amp;rdquo; server.
The resident set size of these servers is relatively small, 3.5 GB per instance, as shown by the left-lower red bubble.
The virtual size is not quite 10 GB.
The server instance will grow until it reaches the virtual size.
Total memory consumption is shown in the upper-left bubble, 11.6 GB are used (the sum of the servers plus some extra from the OS).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We run the servers with &lt;code&gt;-Xmx4096M -Xms4096M&lt;/code&gt; each, which is rather generous.
This creates processes with a total &lt;code&gt;VIRT&lt;/code&gt; size of ~ 10 GB, of which &lt;code&gt;RES&lt;/code&gt; is the actually comitted memory, around 3.5 GB per process.
This results in 11.2 GB memory usage, plus 0.4 GB extra from other processes on the instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our total memory is 32 GB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The server load is shown as 0.41/8.0, so the machine is pretty idle, and the CPU load meters above the memory meter agrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/02/native-thread-02.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Output of the &lt;code&gt;htop&lt;/code&gt; program, detail. When hitting &lt;code&gt;H&lt;/code&gt; to toggle display of user threads, the number of running threads is also shown.
We are running 245 threads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hitting &lt;code&gt;H&lt;/code&gt; (Uppercase-H) in &lt;code&gt;htop&lt;/code&gt; unfolds user threads display. It also shows the total number of threads running next to the number of tasks (processes).
In our case, we are running with 245/1100 threads.
This is by far the most scarce resource.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Service Directories, and what they are good for</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/02/06/service-directories-and-what-they-are-good-for.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Feb 2023 06:07:08 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/02/06/service-directories-and-what-they-are-good-for.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At a previous job we had a home-grown application &amp;ldquo;Service Directory&amp;rdquo;, which allowed a team to declare a service or deployed application.
The record for a service not only declared the application with pointers to the source code repository, artifacts and documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also pointed to the operational facts, such as criticality, the owning teams, the SLO, the alerts, and the collected stats and dashboards.
And, most importantly, you had to declare dependencies &amp;ndash; which other services you depend on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;using-dependencies-for-firewalls-and-passwords&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#using-dependencies-for-firewalls-and-passwords&#34;&gt;
	Using Dependencies for Firewalls and Passwords
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From data in service directory firewall rules were being generated, automatically.
That meant that with a non-existent or incomplete SD declaration you could talk to nothing and nobody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, all machine accounts (non-personal accounts, NPAs) were provisioned with Hashicorp Vault, controlled by SD.
The data in vault was autogenerated, based on – you guessed it – data from the service directory.
And it was rotated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, every week or so new accounts with new passwords were being added to Vault, picked up by the services, and then also picked up by the clients – order matters a lot here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having individualized machine accounts per application helps a lot to identify service (or database) abuse.
It also allows for individualized rate limits or other controls, and of course minimal permissioning of applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monitoring would see if old accounts from last week were still being used.
If so, somebody would need to talk to the team owning the service using these accounts, because obviously something was caching credentials somehow, when it should not.
If old accounts are quiet and stay so for some time, the old accounts can be decommissioned and deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also makes some nice graphs showing the speed of account (and password) rotation across the enterprise, and these things come handy in audits.
It allows you to prove that passwords are fresh, and that old NPA secret in the hands of leavers cannot be leveraged to gain access to production.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#using-dependencies-for-capacity-and-business-continuity-planning&#34;&gt;
	Using Dependencies for Capacity and Business Continuity planning
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having dependency data also comes in handy in many other tasks, such as (with additional data) planning capacity.
While SD data does not directly contain the volumes needed to plan, dependencies show who can generate demand on a service, and from that it is clear what to measure and where to pick up additional information, such as current fleet size, plans for the coming season and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dependency web can also be mapped on locations and structural failure boundaries from the underlying physical machinery, and thus it becomes possible to calculate failure scenarios, and using actual placement data, detect co-failure scenarios or write scheduler plugins to avoid them.
Also, mapping dependencies into a graph allows for a functioning black start plan.
It would still require testing, but at least the data for such a thing is there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;dependency-inflation&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#dependency-inflation&#34;&gt;
	Dependency Inflation
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In such a setup, having not enough dependencies will make an application not work.
Thus, SD data can be relied on to be at least as large as the minimum dependencies, or larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;or larger&amp;rdquo; part is undesirable, but hard to  limit.
The only workable way I have seen requires annoying recurring audits, or equally nagging regular re-requests for all resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experimentally, requested resources and observed resource usage in production can be mapped on each other, and unused resources can be detected.
They cannot be automatically cancelled, because they still may be necessary, if only in rare situations.
But this would at least bring the nag-level down to manageable sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mastodon Interaction Counters</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/01/25/mastodon-interaction-counters.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 06:07:08 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/01/25/mastodon-interaction-counters.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://toot.io/@Sirsquid/109750677079204971&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;

, SirSquid@toot.io asks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can someone explain to me why seeing retoots and likes is wildly different across Mastodon servers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From toot.io, a toot from @gamingonlinux@mastodon.social shows hardly anything.
But when viewing it on mastodon.social, it has &lt;em&gt;tons&lt;/em&gt; of both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one thing I would love to see properly cleaned up on Masto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastodon is using ActivityPub, a federated protocol.
Nodes exchange articles, and each node caches articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for a node to receive an article from a remote user in the first place, at least one user on the system needs to subscribe to that remote user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So given the following situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/01/mastodon-subscribe.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;em&gt;On mastodon.social, the user GamingonLinux subscribes to SirSquid@toot.io.
On chaos.social, the user isotopp subscribes to SirSquid@toot.io.
On subscription, the toot.io server is notified of the subscription.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two users on two different servers, isotopp@chaos.social, and GamingonLinux@mastodon.social, subscribe to SirSquid@toot.io.
The server toot.io is notified of this, and will deliver new posts from SirSquid to these two remote servers.
Old articles from SirSquid do not exist on either remote server, they will not be backlogged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When SirSquid now posts a new article, the following happens because of the subscription:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/01/mastodon-post.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SirSquid posts a new article.
The new article only exists at toot.io.
It enters the Local Timeline, which is a view into the Out-queue of that server.
The article is now delivered to the home servers of all subscribers.
On delivery, it enters the Federated Timeline, which is a view into the In-queue of that server.
The local subscribers are then notified and are shown the local copy of that article.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When SirSquid posts a new article, this article is locally created on toot.io.
This is going to be the master copy of the new article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article also enters the local timeline of that server, which can be thought of as a view of the Out-queue of the server.
(This is not actually precisely true, because posts can be unlisted or otherwise restricted in visibility.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Queue workers on toot.io will eventually fetch the master copy of the article, determine the articles subscribers, and then try to post the article to the subscribers remote servers.
When that works, the article enters the In-queue of the remote server.
When that does not work, retries can happen.
The In-queue of the remote server is visible (with visibility restrictions) as the Federated Timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each incoming new post, the local subscribers are notified and are shown the local copy of that post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a user is very popular and has many followers, their posts need to be copied to all subscribers, which can be literally on every single server in the Fediverse.
That means thousands of deliveries of the post need to be made. That can take time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all servers will always be immediately reachable.
A certain percentage of deliveries will fail, and be backlogged.
The source server will have to retry a certain number of times, and if the error persists, give up.
The subscribers on the unavailable server will lack a copy of that post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users on, say, mastodon.social, could still discover missing posts if they checked the home timeline of SirSquid on toot.io.
They won&amp;rsquo;t find the post on the copy of the home timeline of SirSquid on mastodon.social.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When readers on mastodon.social or chaos.social interact with the local copy of a post, this will happen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/01/mastodon-interaction.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A user on chaos.social boosts the post.
The local boost counter for the post is updated.
The counter change is forwarded to the originating server, toot.io.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A user on mastodon.social likes the post.
The local like counter for the post is updated.
The counter change is forwarded to the originating server, toot.io.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interactions are being aggregated at toot.io.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interactions with a post are updated locally: A boost on chaos.social increments the boost-counter on chaos.social, and a like on mastodon.social increments the like-counter on mastodon.social.
Such interactions are also forwarded back to the master copy of the post.
That is, updates for each boost and each like are being sent back to toot.io.
The counter at the posts master copy aggregates all these interactions and has totals for the post.
Notifications are being sent to SirSquid@toot.io, and go Ding, Ding, Ding!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a user is very popular and has many subscribers, and a post is very popular and has many interactions,
the originating server (here: toot.io) will receive updates from many thousand remote servers, one for each like or boost of the post on any server.
These updates will need to be persisted, that is, written to disk into a database.
This will generate a lot of load on the originating server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aggregated notifications won&amp;rsquo;t be forwarded back to the local copies.
That is, the master copy of the post at toot.io will have the aggregate number of likes and boosts.
But these aggregated numbers will not be redistributed back to the subscribers and their servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our example, the post will have one like and one boost on toot.io, but only one like and no boosts on mastodon.social.
It will have no likes and one boost on chaos.social.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distributing all counter updates in increments of one to each and every server that has subscribers to SirSquid&amp;rsquo;s posts would just be too much work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is why interaction counters in ActivityPub are usually different on each server, and only the master copy of the post has true counter values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or true-ish.
Of course, just like individual articles may never reach individual servers if they are unreachable too long, the same can happen backwards with counter updates.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I don&#39;t hate Let&#39;s Encrypt anymore</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/01/04/i-dont-hate-letsencrypt-anymore.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2023 06:07:08 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/01/04/i-dont-hate-letsencrypt-anymore.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, Rachel is in a bad mood:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2023/01/03/ssl/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Why I still have an old-school cert on my https site&lt;/a&gt;


and I feel her.
Like her, for my own sites I have always been running Apache.
There was never much need to upgrade, the software was available, stable, and fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point in time, I needed TLS and started to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://letsencrypt.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was messy: Running
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dehydrated-io/dehydrated&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;dehydrated&lt;/a&gt;

,
a bunch of haphazard shell scripts trying to get certificates authenticated and installed, through a wild chain of callbacks and sourced scripts all over the system,
driven by Cron, and with bad alerting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of that was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, starting with Apache 2.4.30 (19-Feb-2018), Apache supports
&lt;a href=&#34;https://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/mod/mod_md.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;mod_md&lt;/a&gt;

,
and that supports Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt out of the box.
For good measure, I also enabled &lt;a href=&#34;https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_macro.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;mod_macro&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This being an Ubuntu, I put this into my &lt;code&gt;/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-apacheconf&#34; data-lang=&#34;apacheconf&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;ServerName&lt;/span&gt; mybasedomain.koehntopp.de
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;MDomain&lt;/span&gt; mybasedomain.koehntopp.de contentdomain.koehntopp.de proxydomain.koehntopp.de
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;MDContactEmail&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;@example.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;MDCerticateAgreement&lt;/span&gt; accepted
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;MDPrivateKeys&lt;/span&gt; RSA &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;4096&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no additional &amp;ldquo;SSLEngine&amp;rdquo; needed, except &lt;code&gt;SSLEngine on&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also add two macros that I use a lot to create virtual hosts to the same file.
One is for straight-up content domains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-apacheconf&#34; data-lang=&#34;apacheconf&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;Macro&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;VHost $host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;VirtualHost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;*:80&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;ServerName&lt;/span&gt; $host
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;ServerAdmin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;@example.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;DocumentRoot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;sx&#34;&gt;/var/www/&lt;/span&gt;$host

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;Options&lt;/span&gt; Indexes FollowSymLinks
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;AllowOverride&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;Require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; granted

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other is for Proxy Domains to dockerized stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-apacheconf&#34; data-lang=&#34;apacheconf&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;Macro&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;ProxyVHost $host $toport&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;ProxyPassReverse&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;/&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;http://127.0.0.1:$toport/&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;RequestHeader&lt;/span&gt; set X-Forwarded-Proto %{REQUEST_SCHEME}s
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;RequestHeader&lt;/span&gt; set X-Forwarded-For %{REMOTE_ADDR}s
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;RequestHeader&lt;/span&gt; set X-Real-IP %{REMOTE_ADDR}s
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;AllowEncodedSlashes&lt;/span&gt; NoDecode
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/VirtualHost&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/Macro&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actual host definition can then be rather short.
A content domain is simply&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Use Vhost contentdomain.koehntopp.de&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt; /etc/apache2/sites-available/contentdomain.koehntopp.de.conf
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; a2ensite contentdomain.koehntopp.de
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;and I am done. Similarly, a proxy to some internal service:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Use ProxyVHost proxydomain.koehntopp.de 3000&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt; /etc/apache2/sites-available/proxydomain.koehntopp.de.conf
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; a2ensite proxydomain.koehntopp.de
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;3000&lt;/code&gt; is the exposed port from docker. An &lt;code&gt;apachectl configtest&lt;/code&gt; and an &lt;code&gt;apachectl graceful&lt;/code&gt; later things are rolling.
A look at &lt;code&gt;/server-status&lt;/code&gt; will tell you if things worked, and what the state of the &lt;code&gt;mod_md&lt;/code&gt; deployment is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you added a new domain, that certificate will be available, but not yet loaded, so a second reload is necessary for deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find the actual cert files in &lt;code&gt;/etc/apache2/md/domains/mybasedomain.koehntopp.de&lt;/code&gt;, as &lt;code&gt;pubcert.pem&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;privkey.pem&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional Note:&lt;/strong&gt;
You can use &lt;code&gt;mod_md&lt;/code&gt; to get certificates for your Tailscale domains (Domains in the &lt;code&gt;*.ts.net&lt;/code&gt; namespace).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MySQL: Ways to run mysqldump</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/01/03/mysql-ways-to-run-mysqldump.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2023 01:02:03 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/01/03/mysql-ways-to-run-mysqldump.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This text exists mainly so that I paste the URL into the &lt;code&gt;#mysql&lt;/code&gt; channel in Libera IRC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;mysqldump&lt;/code&gt; tools allows you to convert a MySQL database server or individual schemas back to SQL.
You are left with a script that is supposed to be loadable into a target server and gives you back the full database, including all objects in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read that SQL as a script into an empty server to create a new instance, or process it with different tools for different purposes.
So in general, a workflow can look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; mysqldump --options --more-options and parameters &amp;gt; somescript.sql
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; scp somescript.sql somewhere@else.com:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; ssh somewhere@else.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; mysql --show-warnings --whatever-options &amp;lt; somescript.sql
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of &lt;code&gt;mysql&lt;/code&gt; with an input redirect, you may also use the command line client and the &lt;code&gt;source&lt;/code&gt; command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; mysql --show-warnings --whatever-options
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;mysql&amp;gt; source somescript.sql
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;tldr&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#tldr&#34;&gt;
	TL;DR
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get everything, run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; mysqldump ...  --single-transaction --source-data&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;   --routines --triggers --events &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;   --all-databases &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; gzip -9 &amp;gt; mydump.sql.gz
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get one database, run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; mysqldump ...  --single-transaction --source-data&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;   --routines --triggers --events &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;   --databases dbname &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; gzip -9 &amp;gt; mydump.sql.gz
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get only the schema, use &lt;code&gt;--no-data&lt;/code&gt;.
For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; mysqldump ...  --single-transaction --source-data&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;   --routines --triggers --events &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;   --no-data &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;   --databases dbname &amp;gt; mydump.sql
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-do-we-get-there&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#how-do-we-get-there&#34;&gt;
	How do we get there?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;setting-expectations&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#setting-expectations&#34;&gt;
	Setting expectations
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQL scripts are not a compact data representation, and often the &lt;code&gt;mysqldump&lt;/code&gt; of a server is larger than &lt;code&gt;$DATADIR&lt;/code&gt; of that instance.
The script usually compresses very well.
So it is useful to run &lt;code&gt;gzip&lt;/code&gt; or similar on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQL scripts are a representation of the data in the instance in textual form without indexes.
Reading the script into a new server not only requires parsing the SQL into server internal data structures.
It also requires that indexes are being rebuilt, and that is a process that consumes a lot of CPU and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people would suggest that you do not ship data larger than 10 GB in the form of a &lt;code&gt;mysqldump&lt;/code&gt;, because loading it will take too long.
As a rule of thumb that holds well, but it really is a function of memory available for index building, and the size of the largest index in the dump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;mysqldump&lt;/code&gt; is single threaded. It profits from faster CPUs, but not from more cores.
Loading a dump is also single threaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defaults of &lt;code&gt;mysqldump&lt;/code&gt; are somewhat sane, if you only want to dump tables.
For code in the database, additional options are required that are not part of the standard configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dumping-everything-atomically&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#dumping-everything-atomically&#34;&gt;
	Dumping everything, atomically
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are assuming here that all tables are InnoDB, without exception.
If in 2023 you still are using non-transactional tables, you are beyond help anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dumping all data in the database takes time.
While running the dump, the data you are trying to dump may change due to other processes making changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, with the default isolation level, each single table will maintain a consistent read view while being dumped.
It will therefore not change for the &lt;code&gt;mysqldump&lt;/code&gt; while it is being dumped.
But between tables changes may happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The option &lt;code&gt;--single-transaction&lt;/code&gt; can be used to run the entire &lt;code&gt;mysqldump&lt;/code&gt; in a single transaction, providing you with a consistent dump of the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A consistent dump of a database is associated with exactly one binlog position.
In traditional replication, and for bookkeeping purposes, it is useful to take note of this binlog position.
So the option &lt;code&gt;--source-data=2&lt;/code&gt; (previously &lt;code&gt;--master-data=2&lt;/code&gt;) should also be used to record this binlog position in the dump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will result in a comment to be added at the top of the dump file looking like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-mysql&#34; data-lang=&#34;mysql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;--
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;-- Position to start replication or point-in-time recovery from
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;--
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;-- CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_LOG_FILE=&amp;#39;binlog.000005&amp;#39;, MASTER_LOG_POS=157;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, our &lt;code&gt;mysqldump&lt;/code&gt; command to dump everything should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; mysqldump ... --single-transaction --source-data&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;dumping-code-in-the-database&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#dumping-code-in-the-database&#34;&gt;
	Dumping code in the database
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, &lt;code&gt;mysqldump&lt;/code&gt; will not dump all non-table objects in the database.
You need to pass &lt;code&gt;--routines&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;--trigger&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;--events&lt;/code&gt; to get all the code from the database as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On newer versions of MySQL, &lt;code&gt;--trigger&lt;/code&gt; is enabled by default, so they are dumped.
On older versions, you would have to manually mention it on the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even on the most recent versions of MySQL, stored functions, stored procedures and events are not dumped automatically.
You would have to mention &lt;code&gt;--routines&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;--events&lt;/code&gt; for them to be dumped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On older versions of MySQL that was not a problem, if the &lt;code&gt;mysql.*&lt;/code&gt; schema was part of the dump.
Inside it were tables in there that contained functions, procedures and even definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with MySQL 8, these tables are no longer used, because the definitions are now stored in hidden data dictionary tables.&lt;br&gt;
Using these options is now mandatory, if you want this code to be part of the dump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in order to also dump code in the database, our command becomes now&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; mysqldump ... --single-transaction --source-data&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; --trigger --routines --events
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;--opt-is-a-set-of-options-enabled-by-default&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#--opt-is-a-set-of-options-enabled-by-default&#34;&gt;
	&lt;code&gt;--opt&lt;/code&gt; is a set of options enabled by default
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;mysqldump&lt;/code&gt; runs with &lt;code&gt;--opt&lt;/code&gt; enabled by default.
You could run with &lt;code&gt;--skip-opt&lt;/code&gt; to prevent this, but this is not helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;--opt&lt;/code&gt; is a shorthand for the following collection of options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--add-drop-table&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Generate a &lt;code&gt;DROP TABLE&lt;/code&gt; statement before each &lt;code&gt;CREATE TABLE&lt;/code&gt; statement in the dump.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--add-locks&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Enclose the &lt;code&gt;INSERT&lt;/code&gt; statements loading data into the table with &lt;code&gt;LOCK TABLES&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;UNLOCK TABLES&lt;/code&gt; statements.
This used to make data load faster for MyISAM tables, but should not be necessary for InnoDB tables.
It is not harmful, especially not for initial data loads, so do not worry about it.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--create-options&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Preserve all MySQL specific create options for all tables.
This is very much needed in almost all use-cases.
It may be disabled for data transport from MySQL to other database systems.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--disable-keys&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;For each table, enclose the &lt;code&gt;INSERT&lt;/code&gt; statements in &lt;code&gt;DISABLE KEYS&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ENABLE KEYS&lt;/code&gt; statements.
For MyISAM tables, this improves data load speed, and index quality.
For InnoDB, it does nothing, but is also not harmful.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--extended-insert&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The &lt;code&gt;INSERT&lt;/code&gt; statements generated will use extended insert syntax.
This will generate very long lines in the dump (matching whatever is defined as &lt;code&gt;max-allowed-packet&lt;/code&gt;).
This will minimize round trips, and make the load faster.
It will make grepping and editing the dump very hard.
It may create problems loading the data, if the source server has a modified, large &lt;code&gt;max-allowed-packet&lt;/code&gt;.
Depending on what you want to do with the dump, it may be useful to &lt;code&gt;--skip-extended-insert&lt;/code&gt; to turn this off.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--lock-tables&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This will lock the local tables before dumping them.
This is important when using MyISAM tables, and is overridden, if tables are InnoDB, and &lt;code&gt;--single-transaction&lt;/code&gt; is used.
So we are okay with it.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--quick&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This dumps the tables using &lt;code&gt;mysql_use_result()&lt;/code&gt;, so the result is streamed using very little memory in the client.
If you run with &lt;code&gt;--skip-quick&lt;/code&gt;, full tables will be downloaded into the client before then can be dumped.
If these tables are many gigabytes in size, &lt;code&gt;mysqldump&lt;/code&gt; will be using a lot of memory, and will be very unhappy.
Do not disable &lt;code&gt;--quick&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--set-charset&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Generate a &lt;code&gt;SET NAMES&lt;/code&gt; statement as needed to preserve character encoding.
This should be always on, in order to preserve character encoding correctly.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, you should be fine with &lt;code&gt;--opt&lt;/code&gt; and there is no need to change anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, you want to run with &lt;code&gt;--skip-extended-insert&lt;/code&gt;, in order to search and manually edit the data in the dump easier.
The dump will load somewhat slower, and will be somewhat larger in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dumping-only-the-schema&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#dumping-only-the-schema&#34;&gt;
	Dumping only the schema
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to dump only the schema, and not the data, there is an option for that: &lt;code&gt;--no-data&lt;/code&gt;.
You get an SQL file with no &lt;code&gt;INSERT&lt;/code&gt;, only &lt;code&gt;CREATE TABLE&lt;/code&gt; and friends.
You would still need &lt;code&gt;--routines&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;--triggers&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;--events&lt;/code&gt; to get all the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; mysqldump ... --single-transaction --source-data&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;     --trigger --routines --events &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;     --no-data
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;dumping-all-databases-or-just-one-database&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#dumping-all-databases-or-just-one-database&#34;&gt;
	Dumping all databases, or just one database
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;--all-databases&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#--all-databases&#34;&gt;
	&amp;ndash;all-databases
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to tell &lt;code&gt;mysqldump&lt;/code&gt; what to dump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be &lt;code&gt;--all-databases&lt;/code&gt;, which will do exactly that, including the &lt;code&gt;mysql&lt;/code&gt; database with all the grants, the help, the timezone data and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;--all-databases&lt;/code&gt; is being used, each database in the dump will be created with a &lt;code&gt;CREATE DATABASE&lt;/code&gt; statement.
A matching &lt;code&gt;DROP DATABASE&lt;/code&gt; statement is not being generated.
That is less of a problem than one might assume, because the generated &lt;code&gt;CREATE DATABASE&lt;/code&gt; statement is protected by an &lt;code&gt;IF NOT EXISTS&lt;/code&gt; clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it may be useful to &lt;code&gt;DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS&lt;/code&gt; before creating a new one, in order to get rid of tables that should not be there.&lt;br&gt;
To achieve this, you could add the option &lt;code&gt;--add-drop-database&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But: If you do that together with &lt;code&gt;--all-databases&lt;/code&gt;, then a &lt;code&gt;DROP DATABASE ...;&lt;/code&gt; statement will put in front of each &lt;code&gt;CREATE DATABASE&lt;/code&gt; statement, including the &lt;code&gt;mysql&lt;/code&gt; system database:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-mysql&#34; data-lang=&#34;mysql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt;/*!40000 DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS `mysql`*/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;CREATE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;DATABASE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt;/*!32312 IF NOT EXISTS*/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt;/*!40100 DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt;/*!80016 DEFAULT ENCRYPTION=&amp;#39;N&amp;#39; */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;USE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In MySQL 8, the &lt;code&gt;mysql&lt;/code&gt; schema cannot be dropped anymore, so you need to edit that out manually to make the dump useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why &lt;code&gt;mysqldump&lt;/code&gt; does  not special case this schema nobody knows:
it is known broken, and documented as broken in the manual page.
But nobody cared enough to put this single &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (!my_strcasecmp(charset_info, ..., &amp;quot;mysql&amp;quot;))&lt;/code&gt; into
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/blob/a246bad76b9271cb4333634e954040a970222e0a/client/mysqldump.cc#L4547&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;the codebase&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We end up running&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; mysqldump ...  --single-transaction --source-data&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;   --routines --triggers --events &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;   --all-databases --add-drop-database &amp;gt; mydump.sql
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-single-database&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#a-single-database&#34;&gt;
	A single database
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of dumping all database, maybe we want just one database, or even a single table from a single database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run &lt;code&gt;mysqldump databasename&lt;/code&gt; to dump a single database like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; mysqldump ...  --single-transaction --source-data&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;   --routines --triggers --events &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;   databasename &amp;gt; mydump.sql
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;no &lt;code&gt;CREATE DATABASE&lt;/code&gt; statement is generated.
You will just get a sequence of &lt;code&gt;CREATE TABLE&lt;/code&gt; statement.
This can easily be imported into a differently named database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, adding &lt;code&gt;--add-drop-database&lt;/code&gt; to this does nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run &lt;code&gt;mysqldump --databases databasename&lt;/code&gt; to dump a single database instead,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; mysqldump ...  --single-transaction --source-data&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;   --routines --triggers --events &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;   --databases databasename &amp;gt; mydump.sql
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;this does generate a leading &lt;code&gt;CREATE DATABASE&lt;/code&gt; statement.
That is, because the &lt;code&gt;--databases&lt;/code&gt; option accepts a space separated list of databases to dump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, using &lt;code&gt;--add-drop-database&lt;/code&gt; will do what is expected from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To dump a single table, use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; mysqldump ...  --single-transaction --source-data&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;   --routines --triggers --events &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;   --databases databasename --tables tablename &amp;gt; mydump.sql
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternately mixing &lt;code&gt;--databases&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;--tables&lt;/code&gt; will not work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MySQL: The command line client</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/12/28/mysql-the-command-line-client.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Sep 2022 12:13:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/12/28/mysql-the-command-line-client.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When asking for help in &lt;a href=&#34;https://libera.chat/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Libera Chat&lt;/a&gt;

, in the &lt;code&gt;#mysql&lt;/code&gt; channel, people will ask you to use the &lt;code&gt;mysql&lt;/code&gt; command line client.
They will also point you to &lt;a href=&#34;https://dbfiddle.uk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;dbfiddle.uk&lt;/a&gt;

 for asking questions.
Specifically, when using phpMyAdmin, you will get hate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asking for help, it is almost impossible to help a GUI user, because they will need to paste screenshots in order to document what they did.
The screenshots do not help us.
They are hard to read, and do not contain the information about the problem you need help with in textual form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it is often that GUI users do not see all the details from a large result set cell.
Specifically, things such as the output of &lt;code&gt;SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS&lt;/code&gt; and similar usually fail to display in a GUI in a meaningful way.
This is never a problem with a command line client, even if that client is used in a wrong way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, many GUI clients disconnect and reconnect between queries, and this is hardly documented.
This makes it impossible to use
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/07/28/mysql-connection-scoped-state.html&#34;&gt;connection scoped state&lt;/a&gt;

,
such as transactions, @variables or per-session config.
Specifically, by construction, phpMyAdmin cannot handle this at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why we ask users to use the &lt;code&gt;mysql&lt;/code&gt; command line client.
It works, we know it works, and it can handle large result sets in a way that is helpful to you and us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;using-g-and-g&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#using-g-and-g&#34;&gt;
	Using \g and \G
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;mysql&lt;/code&gt; command line client has an online help.
Type &lt;code&gt;\h&lt;/code&gt; and read it.
It is useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The command line client also has &lt;code&gt;readline&lt;/code&gt; support.
That means, emacs editing keys and cursor keys work.
You can &lt;code&gt;C-A&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;C-E&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Esc f&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Esc b&lt;/code&gt; and similar.
You can &lt;code&gt;C-R&lt;/code&gt; for history search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The command line client requires that you use &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;\g&lt;/code&gt; (&amp;ldquo;go&amp;rdquo;) to terminate a command.
This will print the result set in a box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-mysql&#34; data-lang=&#34;mysql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;kris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;localhost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;kris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kp&#34;&gt;tables&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+----+------------+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;rows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also use &lt;code&gt;\G&lt;/code&gt; (note the upper case &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo;) to terminate a command.
This will output results as Key-Value pairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;homemycnf&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#homemycnf&#34;&gt;
	$HOME/.my.cnf
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;mysql&lt;/code&gt; command line client will read a &lt;code&gt;$HOME/.my.cnf&lt;/code&gt;, if you install one.
It will, among other sections, also read the &lt;code&gt;[mysql]&lt;/code&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a meaningful &lt;code&gt;$HOME/.my.cnf&lt;/code&gt;.
Note that in my case, I include a cleartext password for a throwaway user on purpose, for convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;kris@server:~$ cat .my.cnf

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;prompt=\U [\d]&amp;gt;\_
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am using &lt;code&gt;prompt=&lt;/code&gt; to get a useful prompt.
I am using &lt;code&gt;show-warnings&lt;/code&gt;, because I do want to see all warnings, all the time, straight into my face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could put the connection data (&lt;code&gt;user=&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;password=&lt;/code&gt;) into a &lt;code&gt;[client]&lt;/code&gt; section.
This would also be read by &lt;code&gt;mysqldump&lt;/code&gt; and friends, and make it even more convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;pager&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#pager&#34;&gt;
	Pager
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-mysql&#34; data-lang=&#34;mysql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;pager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;less&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;largetable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;condition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;manyrows&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;select&lt;/code&gt; result will then show up in &lt;code&gt;less&lt;/code&gt;, which is useful.
I can disable this with &lt;code&gt;nopager&lt;/code&gt;, or by using &lt;code&gt;pager&lt;/code&gt; with no argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-mysql&#34; data-lang=&#34;mysql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;pager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;grep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;whatIwant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;largetable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;condition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;hardtofind&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;nopager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will pipe the result through &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; instead of using &lt;code&gt;less&lt;/code&gt;.
Yes, this is funny, because using &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; on a database result is a kind of joke.
But it is also useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;pager-pspg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#pager-pspg&#34;&gt;
	pager pspg
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want, you can install &lt;code&gt;pspg&lt;/code&gt; and use &lt;code&gt;pager pspg&lt;/code&gt; to get fancier output.
Try&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-mysql&#34; data-lang=&#34;mysql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;pager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;pspg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/12/mysql-client-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;pager pspg&lt;/code&gt; shows the output of &lt;code&gt;select * from t&lt;/code&gt;. The cursor can be moved to select rows and columns. Hit &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; to quit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will also handle &lt;code&gt;SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS&lt;/code&gt; just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2022/12/mysql-client-02.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;em&gt;The oversized output of &lt;code&gt;SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;pager pspg&lt;/code&gt; in the MySQL command line client.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;code&gt;pspg&lt;/code&gt; kind of defeats the purpose of the Command Line client for copy and pasteable results.
Do not use it when asking for help or working with dbfiddle.
Do use it at other times, if you care.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Meditations on Quitting</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/12/27/meditations-on-quitting.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Dec 2022 01:02:03 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/12/27/meditations-on-quitting.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I quit often.
At least once a year, but there have been years when I have been quitting four times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time before a performance evaluation, or before important meetings, I sit down and write myself a notice.
I pull up a word processor, start the empty business letter template, fill in the details and the date, and then write the three or four sentences necessary to inform my employer that the time has come to part ways.
I print this, collect the letter, fold it properly and put it into an empty unsealed envelope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I pull it out, unfold it and put it in front of me.
Time to start thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are the logistics of quitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of that is about obligations and finance.
Could I actually walk out of the meeting, leaving the letter behind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been times, when I was younger, where I easily could have done that. Not owning property, being unmarried and without child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a consultant, with 180 travel days a year, I had to build my own personal insurance anyway.
That&amp;rsquo;s  400 in the pocket at any point in time, 4k on an unused rescue credit card &amp;ndash; enough to take me home on my own from anywhere my job would take me.
And a coordinate transformation on my checking account that sees a few 10k as Zero, to provide immediate emergency burn fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough buffer against possible bumps anywhere in the world is also enough buffer to leave when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a family and a house, things are more complicated, and no longer immediate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An exit plan cannot be &amp;ldquo;walking out and leaving the letter&amp;rdquo; when an uninterrupted cash flow is part of the requirements.
But writing the letter is still an important focus point.
So I kept the tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is like a business continuity management plan, but for your soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the logistics done, it is time to lift the gaze from the path in front of my feet, up to the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did I do the last few months?
What projects do I have been part of?
What have I learned?
How have I grown?
And is the place I am in still the place that would let me grow?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no abstract questions.
But in my mind they only become real when I sit in front of this piece of paper, and think about staying or leaving.
I have made sure I could leave if I wanted.
Now it is time to think about what I want from this place to make me stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sometimes explain this to others as the story of the two contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in IT, you always have two contracts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is written.
It says what your job title is, where you work, and what they pay you.
It says what your notice period is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other one is unwritten.
It is the unspoken agreement about the level of autonomy you have, and the decisions you can be part of.
It is the environment you work in and what challenges you can learn from.
It is about the things you build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in IT, I always signed, and I always actually quit, because of this second contract.
When it expires or is violated, it is time to actually leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it all becomes about people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies by construction are usually not loyal to their employees.
In general, as organisations they can&amp;rsquo;t.
Some people inside an org maybe secretly work against the objectives of the organisations and are loyal to other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a person, I always work with other persons.
Over the last 30 years, it has become clear that these persons stay, even when I move.
I am part of my own personal tribe.
I have been building it, maintaining it over a few decades, and when necessary they have been there for me, and I have been there for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the meditation of quitting is also remembering these people.
Maybe they need me.
Maybe I need them.
Maybe I miss them.
Maybe some of them have an invitation or an opportunity for me.
Holding the bond of my current second contract against the pulls from my relationships gives me an important calibration of where I am, who I am and if I am honest with myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually then I have come to some conclusion and I have a plan.
I can fold the notice back up into the envelope, put it into my jacket, and walk into that meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am now grounded, and I know my boundaries, and my goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know who I am.
For some reason that seems to scare people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually then I don&amp;rsquo;t actually have to quit.
But being able to do that, and understanding when and why helps a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 2023-Jan-31, after almost another seven years, my second tour of Booking.com will come to an end.
It was a different ride than the first, it was still amazing, and I met the most wonderful and amazing people.
Still, I have been called, and the second contract is up.
I have to move.&lt;/p&gt;
