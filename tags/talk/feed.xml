      <title>A Journey to Open Compute</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Booking.com hosted the Open Compute Meetup in
Amsterdam. My talk is on Slideshare and a recording is on
Youtube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-21-at-09.54.18.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.slideshare.net/isotopp/a-journey-to-ocp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Slideshare: A journey to OCP&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0Z32UsB5g0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Youtube: A journey to OCP&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cleaned up and more coherent transcript of the talk is here:
&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2018/02/ocp.003.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Booking.com started out as a small online travel agency in
Amsterdam, but is now financially about 15% of Google. We have
about 200 offices in 70 countries, support 46 languages and
reach about any touristically interesting spot on this planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started out selling rooms on a comission basis, but since the
Priceline Group of companies also includes Priceline for
flights, Rentalcars for, well rental cars, and Open Table for
restaurants, it makes sense to integrate that more and graduate
from a Hotel Room marketplace to something more complete, a full
trip or complete experience marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2018/02/ocp.004.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point we have about 30k machines in 3 locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s commodity colo space, built to Uptime Institute Tier-3
standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that are mostly two-socket E5-type machines, and it&amp;rsquo;s at the
two extreme ends of the spectrum, E5-2620&amp;rsquo;s and E5-2690&amp;rsquo;s. We
would like to be able to run on the 2620 stuff completely, of
course, but some parts of our application require the clock and
the Oomph of the large CPUs. We are working on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2018/02/ocp.005-1.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The part of the workload that actually earns us money is mostly
replacing strings taken from a database in HTML templates, we
are a REP MOVSB company. That&amp;rsquo;s boring work, and that is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We try to keep stuff in memory where possible, especially where
customer facing machines are affected. No disk reads, and no
rotating storage in customer facing work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is more complicated stuff in the background. We are
running the usual big data stuff with added deep learning on
top, in image processing, fraud detection and in experimental
user interfaces. We host a large scale data movement
infrastructure with MySQL, Elasticsearch, Cassandra and Hadoop
being involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are trying very hard to be customer centric. Technology is
seen as a necessity, but it&amp;rsquo;s forced upon us by scale. We&amp;rsquo;d
rather focus on the hotel thing. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of stuff is recent, due to growth - Moore&amp;rsquo;s law also
applies backwards. Speaking about growth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2018/02/ocp.006.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few old numbers taken from quarterly public company
performance reports, roomnights and hotels. But it could be
about any metric at Booking, servers, requests, people working
there, meals served in the canteen or sum of database requests -
you would see the same curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a log-Y scale it&amp;rsquo;s even nicer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2018/02/ocp.007.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some nice straight lines.If I were to draw the yearly increase
in compute power as given by Moores law into this graph, you
would see that this is also a mostly flat line, unfortunately
one that is raising far slower that the other lines here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a scalability person like me it means a tough life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2018/02/ocp.008.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing the lines out naively sees us covering the earth in data
centers by 2040 or so. That&amp;rsquo;s a problem, because where are we
going to put the hotels?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course that&amp;rsquo;s not going to happen, but it underlines that we
need to change our ways of handling stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2018/02/ocp.009.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, we are handling the hardware part &amp;ldquo;enterprise&amp;rsquo;y&amp;rdquo;. So
we get space, build out the room, add racks, switches and
chassis and then put hardware in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That happens in waves, with different latency and mutual
dependencies, and that can go wrong in many ways. On the other
hand, it delays decisions and spending as long as possible. To
us, being a very Dutch company with a very high volatility due
to the growth, delaying such Capex as long as possible is
attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the Hardware is down, we are on top of things - we have a
system of software components called ServerDB which basically
enables full hardware lifecycle management, interfacing at the
front with the Purchase Orders database, doing everything a user
could want to do to a machine with API and Web Interfaces, and
finalizing machine lifetime many times later with a
decommissioning workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ServerDB not only manages the hardware, it also has complete
overview about all other assets, does the config management for
switches, storage, collects power data and temperature
information and links into monitoring, load balancer
configuration and to puppet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2018/02/ocp.010.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using commercial colo space means many constraints. We are in
small rooms, multiple 0.5MW sizes, and that creates a number of
placement constraints and unwanted cabling requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power and cooling framework we have to live in is about
7kW/rack, which is about half of what we want. Look at the
image, that&amp;rsquo;s a blade center that has the potential to create
6.4kW of power draw under full load, so you are looking at
non-oversubscribed racks that are 10/40U full. That&amp;rsquo;s about knee
high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2018/02/ocp.011.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a test run of a single blade from that bladecenter,
where I am exercising all the cores as hard as possible,
recording the power draw. We reach 50% power draw at 6/56 cores
busy, and using the maximum power draw, times 16 blades, gives
me a total load of 6.4kW from the whole enclosure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2018/02/ocp.012.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, here is a rack of 32 machines (actually 40, but I got
only 32 due to BMC instabilities), exercising at full power.
These are hadoop units, and I can get them to consume 15kW in a
7kW environment, hotspotting and oversubscribing hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some constraints border on the ridiculous, but when we are
receiving a monthly delivery in individual parts, we spam the
unloading and docking areas of the data center with unpacking
trash, making the other tenants quite angry. Also, the build
times are getting unwieldy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the BMC, which is our gateway into the machinery for
ServerDB and it&amp;rsquo;s assorted tools, is a big problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2018/02/ocp.013.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ServerDB contains an abstraction layer that tries to hide the
various differences in functionality and API between the various
kinds of machinery we have. We could do without that just fine,
and Redfish is actually a partial fix to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that we do not use many features, still
ServerDB utilizes Redfish, native vendor specific LOM
functionality and ssh to get what it needs - Power control,
Reset, and setting boot preferences, optionally firmware update
and optionally partitioning and controller setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We collect metrics: power, temperature, cooling and faults, but
that is purely read-only. Auditability is becoming more relevant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;making config changes without a visible interruption of
production is actually arguably a disadvantage, and all the
recents security problems all the way down the stack are
worrying us: BMC, ME and Microcode issues now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of that is underdocumented, and there are way to many way
too convenient ways to access this, from dedicated interfaces to
shared interfaces to local gateways when you physically on the
machine and have access to i2c buses or similar. The defaults
are often insecure, the crypto is often outdated, and the client
requirements are often insecure as well (&amp;ldquo;Install a Java version
your security department will hate you for having on your
machine.&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where do we got from here? What is required to graduate from
this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2018/02/ocp.014.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three issues need adressing: Going Rack Scale, Bringing volume
up and Getting Rooms to match. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at each of these in
turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2018/02/ocp.016.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started ordering hardware by the blade center chassis. That
did good: It solves many of the trash issues, it streamlines the
late provisioning phase where we are putting actual hardware
into the rack. It&amp;rsquo;s limited by what can go into a chassis, and
the chassis we are using are going to be discontinued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We understand why that is necessary, but the direction that is
going to is not what we want. We could do this more, and start
to order by the rack. That has a few requirements that I will be
adressing later, but if you are planning this, the choice is
basically between Intel Rack Scale Design derivatives or Open
Compute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gives you more design flexibility, and it may or may not
retain the savings in power and cooling from shared
power/cooling setup depending on what you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2018/02/ocp.017.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Intel RSD solution is available in many vendor flavors, HP,
Dell and Supermicro all have them. It gives you a Pod and a Rack
controller not unlike a bladecenter chassis controller. On top
of the functionality that ServerDB already offers, you get a
chassis or rack-wide PCI bus, and composable hardware, where you
can build physical machine configurations from CPU and storage
modules in the rack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some companies like Dell even offer casings around the
machinery, in the form of semi-transportable data centers.
Unfortunately most of these solutions try to minimise space and
maximise density, so they come with other constraints and design
decisions that we are reluctant to take on - basically you have
to live in units of 8x8x40 ft shipping containers, and that&amp;rsquo;s
rather limiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s all nifty engineering, but all very vendor specific and
bespoke, when we are really looking for bulk hardware, all as
alike as possible, and with fewer features, not more. Having
&lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;differentiator&lt;/em&gt; is actually a feature we are looking for.
Value add subtracts from the value from the value the machinery
has for us. The actual value add happens higher up the stack, in
software - in management for us that&amp;rsquo;s ServerDB and in
production for us that is more or less Kubernetes or something
that does what K8s does, but differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2018/02/ocp.018.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s exactly the sales promise from Open Compute. Clean,
bare server designs without value add. Documented interfaces
with source code available to read up on the details, so we can
integrate our stuff without problems. Delivery by the rack, and
on top of that, potential operational and capital savings, if
you treat room and rack as a system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2018/02/ocp.019.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the volume up is the next important consideration, and
if we are looking at our machine park, that&amp;rsquo;s going to be a
problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2018/02/ocp.020.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go into ServerDB and count machine profiles, it goes up
to 11: blade 9 and two additional blade2 variants. Actually
digging into this yields basically &amp;rsquo;large and small&amp;rsquo; CPU configs
and memory configs, but lots of different local storage options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2018/02/ocp.021.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is, to quote Jello Biafra, obvious: Ban Everything!
In our case, local storage. So we disaggregate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2018/02/ocp.022.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a rack design where we give a 2 OU, 500 W, 100 GBit slot to
the storage people and provide un-RAID-ed 2 TB local SSD as the
only storage option, we have to build a network to match this.
We are anticipating more east-west traffic from storage
replication and east-west traffic from storage acess. All of
that is happening front-side, production, on regular TCP/IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that means I have only one network topology to scale and
maintain, and I have no longer placement constraints for
workloads: I can build uniform compute, and demand &amp;ldquo;no local
persistence&amp;rdquo;. If you wan to keep your MySQL datadir, put it on
iSCSI, RoCE or NVME via TCP and be done with it. It will be the
size and have the properties you require, it will be at least on
par with local SSD and it will still be there when your machine
dies and you are rescheduling to another spare machine elsewhere
in another rack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Kubernetes on top, you get application mobility,
resiliency, and capacity size adjustment, which is fine, because
even the smallest Silver 4110 is going to be too large for most
units of deployment (in Java, consider 8 cores, 16 GB of RAM to
be a limit, for example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2018/02/ocp.023.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to pull that off will give us 4 profiles or fewer,
disk made to measure as requested, location independence for
applications, and the ability to upgrade hardware without
interfering with the workload. I can evacuate a rack, do my
thing and put it back into service. Also, I can interchange the
components of my machinery independently: storage, memory,
compute and the networking parts are separate and can be on
different renewal cycles. All of that bound together by on
single TCP/IP network, not some bespoke PCI or FC/AL stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2018/02/ocp.024.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming I all have that, I will need rooms to match the rack in
order to fully leverage the advantages of Open Compute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2018/02/ocp.025.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Compute hardware is built to be able to run in a barn:
concrete floor, air-in of up to 35 or 40 deg Centigrade,
hot-aisle containment, all service from the front because data
center operations engineers cannot survive in the hot aisle, and
we can do away with most of the equipment that is part of a
Tier-3 spec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is being said that 1 MW of Tier-3 spec costs about 10 million
for the empty building shell, and that we can get OCP space
built for 2.5 Million/MW according to Facebook. I will be happy
if I can get space for half of the Tier-3 cost or less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non of these savings will materialize if you put OCP into a
traditional Tier-3 building - the power path is not simplified,
the air-in is overcooled and the airco is overdesigned in order
to achive the overcooling which we do no longer require, so the
actual PUE is actually way worse than what we could have from an
OCP compliant data center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2018/02/ocp.026.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do get Tier-3 space easily, though. That is because it is
being built without a buyers name on the constract. Buyers and
sellers meet later, and that is possible over the Tier-3 spec
from Uptime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is a two sided market, where demand and supply are
anonymous, unknown at the time the supply is being built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is not possible at the moment with Open Compute, because
the spec is lacking, not well known to builders and the demand
is not worth building for it. If you need or want OCP compliant
space, that&amp;rsquo;s a larger commitment, because the space is being
built for you, and you will need to keep it for the building
lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2018/02/ocp.027.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So having an OCP compliant data center build spec for OCP
hardware is important to make OCP attractive to smaller
deployments. They do need the quick availability and higher
flexibility of prebuilt space, because that&amp;rsquo;s lowering the
height of the commitment and provides fewer operative
distractions. There is risk for the space provider, so it&amp;rsquo;s
certainly higher cost than a data center build to spec for one
named entity, but that&amp;rsquo;s probably worth it. For a deployment our
size, there is still the problem of many 0.5MW rooms or similar,
capacity fragmentation, but for a more normal sized company
that&amp;rsquo;s actually a non-issue. They can be happy in these spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2018/02/ocp.028.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to sum it up again: How can OCP work on non-hyperscaler
scales? Provide a two sided market for DC space over a shared
spec, then put hardware in there that matches what the room
provides. This creates operational and capital savings from
leveraging the room and the rack as a system that is mutually
dependent and built for each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, once you have stuff in there, have an ecosystem that uses
the documented machine interfaces, all of them interchangeable
and interoperable. Have an ecosystem of open source management
modules like ServerDB for management and Kubernetes for
production, built on top of that, in order to bring utilisation
up and management cost down.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Core.Infra day, I was invited to speak. This is my talk. There were many like it, but this was mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#in-operations-code-is-not-your-friend&#34;&gt;
	In operations, code is not your friend.
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is about what I did the two years I have not been around here. I first worked for Booking in 2006 as a MySQL consultant doing databasey things. I joined Booking as an employee later, in 2008. By then, I was working in Amsterdam, but living in Berlin, so I was flying around quite a bit. In 2014, that became unworkable and I signed on with a Berlin based eCommerce hoster to do some awesome stuffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SysEleven had about 3000 customers, mostly German eCommerce or news sites. The company had less then 50 employees in 2014 and grew to 70 people now. I joined a newly formed team, whose task was to build the new hosting platform for SysEleven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2016/09/obvious/obvious.004.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that we were to build the new platform, there has to be an old one. The old platform was based on single machines with all storage local, and maybe a NetApp or two mounted from external. Hosting was done on OpenVZ based containers, and the Underlay (Hypervisor) was generally managed by puppet. The Overlay (contents of the container), too, mostly. But due to limitations in Puppet, architectural decisions of the past and the nature of the workload imposed by customers that was not done consistently and completely. There was a lot of fuzz around the edges, and some things were completely on manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2016/09/obvious/obvious.005.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new platform was based on Openstack, with a software designed storage solution, and a software designed network solution underneath, no local storage on the machine (all bytes always come from the SDS). Underlay and Overlay were to be completely controlled by Puppet, and in fact, the actual installation process was to be done by Puppet as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We actually succeeded in doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2016/09/obvious/obvious.006.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you have several racks full of HP DL380s, all powered off and cold. The bootstrap talks to the iLOs, turns on the hardware, inventories everything, zaps fresh ROMs and iLOs onto everything, and then paints a base operating system onto the machines that is just enough to bootstrap Puppet. Puppet then continues to install and personalise the machines and build an Openstack from this, including SDS and SDN cluster builds before the Openstack install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total installation time was 30-45 minutes, if everything went well, but usually not everything went well. :-) Also, Puppet as a tool is extremely focused on managing a single host and does not work well with the concept of a cluster. If you want to build such a thing, you end up coding a lot of stuff against the internal logic of Puppet, using Stages to have synchronisation points, or invoking very ugly hacks written as external Python scripts that sync up the cluster before allowing everybody to continue to the next phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned that there is a place that can genuinely and rightfully be called Puppet Hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2016/09/obvious/obvious.007.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made the decision to not write Puppet modules when we could reuse external work. That turned out to be a not so smart solution. We imported external repositories into our internal Gitlab, and in order to structure things, we set up a bunch of different segregated areas, teams. In the end we had about 200 repos, in six different teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2016/09/obvious/obvious.008.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That led to a lot of problems. We did not set out to have these problems, it just kind of inevitably happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;200 Repos is quite a lot, and even with tooling you end up making mistakes. Some people will not be able to see some repos, not because they should not, but because of mistakes. Some things are done manually, others are done automatically, but rules change or team members move, but the rules are not adjusted and other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, you inevitably end up in a situation where you are making a change and you are not aware of all the consumers of the change - either because you can’t see them, or because you did not bother to check out that repo, or because your search did not find them. Not fixing your consumers will break them, and hence the build. That is annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also can’t make your changes atomically. You may make your change at the source, and merge it, but you still need to merge and push the 13 consumers of your change, and that can take time, or fail. Until you complete the merge in all Repos, nobody in the team can roll out. That sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if visibility is limited, it may be that two people are producing or importing duplicate solutions for a problem. Worse, it may be that these duplication are actually duplicate external imports, but at different version requirements. That makes it very hard to manage project dependencies and size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2016/09/obvious/obvious.009.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are doing Puppet, so what is it that we import when we import stuff from Puppetlabs, or github?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, mostly generalised configuration management classes for Puppet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most configuration files are actually Hashes of Hashes with a unique kind of syntactic sugar. MySQL my.cnf files, Bind configuration, Openstack ini-Files, and so on - the are all HoH’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what you get is a YAML-shovel that will generate the HoH that is, say, an Apache vHost-definition from the Hash of Hashes inside Puppet variables. Which in turn are being loaded from the Hash of Hashes that is a Hiera YAML file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you want to make a config change, you can’t edit a native Apache config file. You need to read the code, seeing how the Puppet in-memory HoH is being transformed into the actual Apache config. Then you need to look further back and understand how the twelve dozen Hiera files actually overlay each other to form these Puppet structures, and inject your change in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you need to try this out and actually see what config is being generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2016/09/obvious/obvious.010.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need a lab. For a config change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is because your config and your config generation became so complicated that it is no longer obvious. It is no longer obvious what that code does, and it is no longer obvious what your change does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case the test environment is an entire datacenter, the vanguard data center. That is clearly insane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did we end up in this place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me introduce &lt;a href=&#34;http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2012/05/configuration-complexity-clock.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Configuration Complexity Clock&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2016/09/obvious/obvious.011.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You write a piece of actual code, in a proper programming language. Values are pieces of code, constants. They are baked in. It is noon on the config clock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things change, values need to change. You need different values in different places, so you load variables from a file, the config file. It is now 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somebody needs more than that - there are rules. “Some rooms are only available at some price if the stay includes a Saturday” is such a rule. Or “The amount of memory we give to the Innodb buffer pool is all machine memory minus 20% or 4GB, whichever is smaller, unless it’s a mz box with all that Blob stuff going on.” is another such rule. It is now 6 on the config clock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course some things can no longer be expressed as rules. You need a fully blown language with data structures, control structures, loops and include files. You get a config management DSL. Something like puppet. It’s 9 on the config clock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2016/09/obvious/obvious.012.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;»The team spend most of their time writing code in the new DSL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some embarrassing episodes, they now go through a complete release cycle before deploying new DSL code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DSL text files are version controlled and each release goes through regression testing before being deployed.«&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s SysEleven, doing puppet. That’s us, doing Puppet - if not now, then it’s going to be us very soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2016/09/obvious/obvious.013.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, because what we are doing is no longer obvious, so we need to check the presence and type of parameters to our Puppet classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to write tests that check the validity and content of the subconfigs generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then need to do integration testing, in order to prevent catastrophic loss of the entire site from centralised config changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2016/09/obvious/obvious.014.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At SysEleven, when we were at that point, we stopped. We threw away our complete stack of “Setup Openstack from scratch” and started over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose a different config management system, in our case that was Ansible, but that is not really important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did choose something else than Puppet, mainly so that we were unable to directly reuse any component we previously wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did come up with some rules in order to prevent ourselves from descending into Puppet Hell again. Our goal was to enforce simplicity, and obviousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2016/09/obvious/obvious.015.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did switch to a Monorepo, at least as much as possible. There were other, external dependencies with other parts of the company that prevented us from going completely Monorepo, but it kind of worked well enough for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did use Ansible, and while the actual choice of the config management system officially did not matter as long as it is not Puppet, Ansible does have a number of advantages that Puppet does not have. One of them being that it deals much better with distributed software than Puppet can do, and the other, much more important one being that it is very limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to do complicated things in Ansible. At some point, if Ansible is not sufficient, you need to stop ansibilizing and switch to Python. That’s a good point to raise the issue with the team and asking around what’s actually the problem and how an Ansible extension written in Python is going to make this better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is good, because it gives you a point where reflection and goal-setting are in order, and a hook where project management processes can be invoked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also looked at our YAML shovels and asked ourselves what they are good for. We found that they are overgeneralised solutions for our problems. We do not need to be able to write any conceivable Apache config from our config management code, we only need to be able to write our Apache config from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, more generally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;feature-development-is-about-generalisation-avoiding-limits-delaying-decisions-and-being-more-flexible&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#feature-development-is-about-generalisation-avoiding-limits-delaying-decisions-and-being-more-flexible&#34;&gt;
	Feature development is about generalisation, avoiding limits, delaying decisions and being more flexible.
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;infrastructure-development-is-about-being-concrete-making-decisions-setting-limits-and-being-obvious&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#infrastructure-development-is-about-being-concrete-making-decisions-setting-limits-and-being-obvious&#34;&gt;
	Infrastructure development is about being concrete, making decisions, setting limits and being obvious.
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot stress the importance of that enough. It was at the core of all of our problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to write config files directly. If there is an Apache config, write that Apache config file in Apache config file syntax into the Ansible template directory, and install it as literally as possible. Changes will be obvious in what they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not use variables, unless you can show that in our config there is actually variation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did catch ourselves in review in anticipating problems we didn’t have, introducing complexity we didn’t need. Good thing we did establish review, because every single team member failed at being as simple as possible, multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did have a few cases were it was in order to write code, remove duplication and generate stuff in a loop or similar things, but these cases were few and far between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2016/09/obvious/obvious.016.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our new setup was an order of magnitiude smaller and much, much easier to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did bring in external people and tried to explain to them what we did, and how things work, and the new setup was so much easier to work with that this was actually possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did not need tests any more, because changes were obvious. Code that is not present does not need to be tested in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2016/09/obvious/obvious.017.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, looking at us here: What’s in it for us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do believe, after reading a lot of code in our Puppet and in other places, that Simplicity as a value in itself would work well for us, too.  Code isn’t our friend, either, especially in Core.Infra and Operations related places. We are here to make decisions, not delay them, and to be obvious, and as simple as we can get away with. Which is hard enough given the fact that our size and growth force more and more distributed stuff on us, which by it’s very nature has a high inherent complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the entire container thing is a brilliant idea, and we should be doing it more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immutable containers, being created and then loading values from a Zookeeper or Consul, instead of running Puppet on every host, painting state changes over state changes that may or may not have been previously applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually we will no longer have any need for Puppet at all any more, despite the fact that we are a larger company that is doing a lot more distributed stuff than now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2015/03/27/go-away-or-i-will-replace-you.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the writeup for the english variant of the talk &amp;ldquo;Go away or I will replace you with a very small Shell script&amp;rdquo;. The original version of the talk was given in German at &lt;a href=&#34;https://guug.de/veranstaltungen/ffg2015/abstracts.html#3_1_1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GUUG FFG 2015&lt;/a&gt;

 in Stuttgart. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CCv7pSK4s&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;A recorded version in german language&lt;/a&gt;

 has been made at Froscon in August 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.001.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go Away Or I Will Replace You With A Very Small Shell Script or There Is No Such Thing As A Devops Team&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came up with this talk, because I was invited to the GUUG FFG with the ask &amp;ldquo;to give some thoughts about Devops&amp;rdquo;. I ended up with something that in some way is a reflection about what changed in how we do computers, between approximately the years 2000 and 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.005.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Devops.com, Rajat Bhargava tries to explain in &lt;a href=&#34;https://devops.com/devops_and-enterprises/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;DevOps and Enterprises: It&amp;rsquo;s a culture thing&lt;/a&gt;

 that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DevOps is about increasing company performance through better IT execution. The hypothesis is that by more closely aligning what cus with what gets built in a more timely fashion, organizations will sell more products and services. That’s not a small company or SMB issue, that’s an every company issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, change in companies does not happen by itself - companies by construction try to repeatedly execute the same thing with the same results over and over. Change only happens because of outside pressures. So if companies change the way they do IT to &amp;ldquo;increase company performance through better IT execution&amp;rdquo;, there are outside influences at work that exert pressure on the processes, forcing change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at these outside influences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;maturity-of-market-and-process-and-growth-matters&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#maturity-of-market-and-process-and-growth-matters&#34;&gt;
	Maturity of Market and Process, and Growth matters
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.012.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A maturing environment (left hand side) allowed the development and establishment of quantitatively governed processes. After reaching a certain process maturity level (right hand side), outsourcing of processes in full or in part becomes possible, enabling a make-or-buy decision at the management level.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cynefin model is a soft thing, a model or frame of mind that is used by people to have words and categories to express what tools and project structures make sense in a given context: It can be used to classify &amp;ldquo;decision making contexts&amp;rdquo;. A decision making context is for example a market in which a company is going to act, and then it would become a way to express &amp;ldquo;market maturity&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you apply it to &amp;ldquo;the development of the early Internet&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;the Dotcom bubble before 2000&amp;rdquo;, then you see the very early Dotcom bubble as &amp;ldquo;Nobody has a clue how to even make money on the Internet, much less how to structure a company around this idea&amp;rdquo;. This is the Chaotic domain, subject of the &amp;ldquo;Research&amp;rdquo; model, in which you try out things, and see what sticks. You do not know the rules at all, not even if they are static or changing. You need to get any structure at all. The work model is &amp;ldquo;Act&amp;rdquo; - try a thing, &amp;ldquo;Sense&amp;rdquo; - see what happens and &amp;ldquo;Respond&amp;rdquo; - discard the attempt or if it works, try to modify it and see what changes. With &amp;ldquo;Novel&amp;rdquo; practice you work with very small teams of highly qualified people - a research team - and try to establish and formulate some ground rules. You expect to lose money and to throw away many experiments, quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have found a working business model, and successfully extract any money at all, you can switch to the &amp;ldquo;Complex&amp;rdquo; domain and build on your emergent practice. You secure the position you have found and try out small things, instead of wild guesses all over the place. Again, you try to register what that does to your business and improve (instead of trying something else entirely). Basically you have the business model and now try to build practice at all. You try to move things from Research to Engineering. This also changes team structure - you would work with your Researchers moving to Lead positions with a bunch of applied sciences or engineering grade people working for them. This is now multiple small teams at work, on different aspects of incremental improvement. You focus on iteration, small improvements and may experiment with some basic automation. In the Complex you know there are rules, but they may be not easily discoverable, and they may be changing and stateful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the market and the business matures, it may move to the &amp;ldquo;Complicated&amp;rdquo; domain, in which a Business Model and Basic Practice exists and you now try to find dimensions along which to judge these practices (&amp;ldquo;What are the metrics?&amp;rdquo;) and then try to establish measuring processes for this. Using the metrics you can sense, and exert control by analyzing the metrics and how they change. This is no longer research at all, but engineering at the verge of pure business excecution, preparing for scaleout. You remove the researchers, and add engineering bureaucrats that establish the framework for quantification. In the Complicated market rules exist, and are discoverable, and usually are static or the rules by which they change are also known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Complex and especially in the Complicated, companies are growing in a growing market, and focus is not so much on efficiency as on land grab. Management says things like &amp;ldquo;Do not spend more than we earn at any time, but first and foremost, do not stall growth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally things move into &amp;ldquo;Simple&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Obvious&amp;rdquo; domain, which has well established procedural handbooks, metrics and can draw on past iterations that are similar to the current. So you measure, sense, then look up the proper response and execute it. Best Practice and quantified metrics exist, and you can scale out the process by hiring and training moderately trained people working from the book you prepared in the previous step. This is a mature and stable market, with obvious and discoverable rules and playbooks for all situations. In a mature market, growth is usually only possible at the cost of others, as the market itself is not growing and there is no unclaimed or untapped market share. Instead, growth often is created by efficieny improvements. This is the domain of bureaucrats and beancounters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the right hand side, we have a process maturity model - here it is &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model_Integration&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CMMI&lt;/a&gt;

, but any will do, really. The point being that process maturity follows market maturity: Establishing mature, quantified processes means that you need to be able to iterate, and iterations need to be comparable. So this is basically impossible in the Chaotic and Complex, and also not in the parts of the Complicated where the company is still growing rapidly. If you experiment internally, or if you grow by 10x every other year, your processes will change, even if the deliverables stay the same. That also means that establishing comparable metrics on process execution is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For outsourcing decisions that means they are impossible. In order to have agreement on what is being bought and what has been delivered, it is necessary to have metrics (and before that, a taxonomy). Only then it is possible for both parties to agree what the product is and if it has been delivered as agreed. That also means that Pre-Obvious or Fast-Growing companies will bias towards insourcing, whereas companies where efficiency matters can make the Make-or-Buy decision and decide to outsource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the Dotcom bubble, running IT mostly meant Enterprise IT. Some somebody somewhere had a data center, and in the data center was a large computer called server. Somebody else now connected the data center network to the Internet. After figuring out a few basic concepts such as Firewalls, DMZ and basic network security, people started about thinking connecting the internal IT to the Internet. At that time the Web came around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Web grew, more people used it, and the load on the existing large computers grew. What to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously: buy a larger, faster and newer computer. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Moore&amp;rsquo;s Law&lt;/a&gt;

 gives you an annual growth of around 45% year on year, and that should be right, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.014.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of twelve Enterprise 10000 &amp;ldquo;Starfire&amp;rdquo; at mobilcom, Germany, around 2002.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see some seriously large machines at around that time - there were twelve 64 CPU Enterprise 10000 &amp;ldquo;Starfire&amp;rdquo; machines present at the mobilcom Data Center in Germany in the early 2000&amp;rsquo;s, for example, and many more were deployed in other places just in the area I worked in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.015.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet it became obvious rather quickly that this was not an approach that worked, and even if it worked, it often was prohibitively complex, expensive and slow. Once that became clear, people started to automate basic tasks, learned to mange large fleets of moderately sized machines and then tried a different approach - &amp;ldquo;scale out&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;scale up&amp;rdquo;. Use more computers instead of larger computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This triggered a lot of learnings at all levels of the profession - network, data center structure and operations practice needed revision. This talk will focus on the latter, but the other topics are also of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been known to annoy people with saying that &amp;ldquo;Whenever you are using ssh, you might as well open a ticket.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need to login to a box manually to look something up, you are looking at a monitoring defect - make a ticket for that. If you need to login to a box manually to change something, you are looking at an automation defect - make a ticket for that. I have literally been beaten for saying that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get cfengine 3 (2004), and later Puppet (2005), Salt (2011) and Ansible (2012). Also, somewhere at the end of the observed time frame virtualisation becomes viable, and with that we get automated provisioning of hardware and &amp;ldquo;Infrastructure in Code&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.017.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thinking that permeates software development can now be applied to hardware and infrastructure resources: If there is a problem with a setup, recreate that setup, and the problem in a branch. Then modify the branch to see if that fixes the problem. When it does, merge the branch, and redeploy automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get alignment of tooling in operations with tooling in development. This, and &amp;ldquo;zero manual interactions&amp;rdquo; grade of automation have a great impact:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.018.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automating things makes them reproducible: The same change applied to many instances always produces the same outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that actually works, and has zero manual interactions, we can apply the change to the entire fleet in parallel, instead of filtering it through a single person and serializing it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you can do things fully automated and in parallel, it does no longer matter so much if a single thing fails - you do not care about individual instances any more. Instead you care more about always having sufficient capacity in general, and how to orchestrate all your instances so that this condition is never ever violated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is this stage where we see people moving from &amp;ldquo;highly available setups&amp;rdquo; using Pacemaker and Active/Passive pairs to loadbalancers with &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; workers, all of them active at a sufficiently low utilization factor to buffer away a loss of &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt; units of capacity. All computing becomes distributed computing at some point - more about that in another talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.019.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we change the tooling and the methods to be more closely aligned with Developers, culture also has to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.020.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A figure of the pre-2000 USENET sysadmin culture has been the BOFH - the &lt;a href=&#34;http://bofh.bjash.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Bastard Operator From Hell&lt;/a&gt;

. These are the stories about an outright hostile systems operator, written by Simon Traviaglia and posted to USENET. Parts of that have been sold to magazines and printed later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people picked up on the concept, and the USENET groups alt.sysadmin.recovery and de.alt.sysadmin.recovery were born. People met, for example in German at the series of Cannossa parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.021.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a good mindset or culture. It not only rejects development, and change per se, it is also toxic and hostile, even to the people who actually pay the bill. Never a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course it is a joke, or satire, but unfortunately, stories influcence minds, even when they are meant to be funny or satire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the same time, Thomas A. Limoncelli wrote the proto-devops book &amp;ldquo;The practice of System Administration&amp;rdquo;, which interestingly contained a chapter on how not be to a BOFH - it asked the system administrator to reflect on the structure and processes of the larger company and their place in them. Limoncelli then goes on about how to build useful supporting and reporting structures to function successfully in that structure. He closes with advice on how to respond to unexpected demands without too much toil and effort. It foreshadows a lot of development that caught on later under the label devops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.022.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The current, updated edition of that book is titled &amp;ldquo;The Practice of Systems and network Administration&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;Devops&amp;rdquo; meanwhile, was coined by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/patrickdebois&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Patric Debois&lt;/a&gt;

 in 2008 in Belgium, and pretty much assembled and then taught the same ideas as the Limoncelli book, at a larger scale and using even clearer structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.023.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BOFH practice applied in the 2008 Booking.com office (re-enactment).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-how-do-dev-and-ops-differ&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#so-how-do-dev-and-ops-differ&#34;&gt;
	So how do Dev and Ops differ?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, even at 2008 we already have processes for IT organisations. Large, scaled up and unwieldy processes that have been established top down, though: During the Dotcom boom, the structure of IT support and operations processes had been formulated as well in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITIL&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ITIL&lt;/a&gt;

, and then often badly implemented in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.024.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is entirely valid and sometimes helpful to think of Devops as a reaction to bad ITIL deployments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.025.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom up, &amp;ldquo;apply development methods and thinking to IT operations, while staying small and agile and iterating quickly, and also focusing on automation, metrics capture and data driven improvement&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tear down the wall between software development and operations. Teach operators coding and coding thinking, and teach developers to care about operations and how operations matter, how scale matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jez Humble describes this tweet as a reaction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a fit of rage caused by reading yet another email in which one of our customers proposed creating a &amp;ldquo;devops team&amp;rdquo; so as to &amp;ldquo;implement&amp;rdquo; devops, I tweeted that &amp;ldquo;THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A DEVOPS TEAM.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and later wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://continuousdelivery.com/2012/10/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-devops-team/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;a longer blog post&lt;/a&gt;

 about this, the core of the argument being&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Devops movement addresses the dysfunction that results from organizations composed of functional silos. Thus, creating another functional silo that sits between dev and ops is clearly a poor (and ironic) way to try and solve these problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying developer methods to operations problems changes the environment and tooling. The modern stack looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.033.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Systems are provisioned with &amp;ldquo;Infrastructure as Code&amp;rdquo;, automatically and on demand, via an API with no humans involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The code for the application and the infrastructure itself resides in a shared version control system, where it can also be subject to automation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a one step build and deploy automation that produces deliverables. These are then automatically deployed into production with zero humans involved, if so desired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The deployment and the activation of code paths is separated, using feature flags and instrumentation to compare performance aspects of these code paths. Separation of deployment and activation is key to safe and fast rollouts, gradual activation and &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/01/17/rolling-back-a-rollout.html&#34;&gt;one-click rollbacks&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitoring and freshness indicator on monitoring metrics are key to proper failure detection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instant and shared communication is key to decisive join action in failure situations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two fundamental innovations in here that deserve a special highlight from a &amp;ldquo;ten years later&amp;rdquo; perspective:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;separation-of-rollout-and-activation&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#separation-of-rollout-and-activation&#34;&gt;
	Separation of rollout and activation
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When writing new code, it is useful to wrap the new code and the old code being replaced by the new code into two branches of a feature flag. This is because in a large enough deployment you cannot migrate to the new code in a single atomic transaction anyway: old and new are going to inevitably co-exist for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if that is the case, you might as well make the most of it: Separating rollout and activation allows you to roll out code into production without running it at all, and without running it for all users. Instead you can choose who gets exposed to the new variant in a very controlled way: You can run it for one user, for 1% of the user base, for Mac users only or for users coming from IP addresses identifing as Japanese in origin, or any combination of such criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also instrument that code, and then compare how it behaves - in conversion of sales, in cost of execution, in execution speed and along many dimensions more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separation of rollout and activation, and proper instrumentation of the wrapped code allow you to experiment with variants in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;observability-through-metrics-from-events&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#observability-through-metrics-from-events&#34;&gt;
	Observability through Metrics from Events
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that has proven to be useful is to build a monitoring system on top of an event system. Instead of collecting numeric metrics on machines and pre-aggregating them, logging structured data (JSON or similar) and collecting them centrally has advantages: The numeric metrics can be extracted from the events and pre-aggregated for common and known things to report on, but since the actual events constituting the metrics are persisted, other important things become possible:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metrics can tie back to the actual events that make up the numbers. So when you have identified an anomaly in space (the machines involved) and time, you can look at the actual events that make up the numbers you looked at, and try to identify a root cause.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the actual raw events are available after the fact, it is possible to correlate things over time: &amp;ldquo;When we changed the upper sales funnel this way, immediate conversion increased, but effectively we lost money, because of increased return rates and customer support cost in a three week window after each sale, for &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; percent of the customers of the B-variant of the experiment&amp;rdquo;. These are findings that are impossible to prove without access to raw event data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the actual raw events are available, it is possible to query the raw event data in other, previously unknown dimensions, searching for additional patters - it is possible to debug using event data instead of going each box &amp;ldquo;in person&amp;rdquo; (with ssh) and observing things on the ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case: We get convergence in tooling between Dev and Ops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operational people learn to code, and use this to automate operations, centralize and standardize the monitoring, and developers learn to care about operational aspects, building operations support directly into software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, developers and admins are using the same set of tools. So, let&amp;rsquo;s converge the teams. That&amp;rsquo;s Devops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, cultures clash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the same projects and identical tooling, there are critical differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they seem to be harder to spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are they about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.041.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feature-Developers (&amp;ldquo;Developers&amp;rdquo;) and Infrastructure-Developers (former &amp;ldquo;Operations&amp;rdquo; people) seem to have utterly different metrics for success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.042.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure developers see feature developers as people who focus on new best cases: There is a plan, there is sprint. New features - new best cases - are developed, and what is deemed finished is being released in a big showy party. Everybody is colorful, happy and rolling across the lawn. What isn&amp;rsquo;t finished goes back onto the backlog, and that is that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.043.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure developer know that is not true for themselves. They look at themselves like in this picture, complete with helmet webcams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nobody has ever flipped a light switch and exclaimed &amp;lsquo;Awesome. The light actually turned on!&amp;rsquo; when it worked. But flip the switch only once, and it does not turn on: people will complain and remember that for a long time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of that, infrastructure developers judge change by looking at how worst cases behave and how worst case behavior changes with changed code. Only then they will look at other improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.046.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two famous Booking rules for rollouts, from the early days:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#1 If you break it, will you even notice?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#2 If you break it, can you fix it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to #1 should be &amp;ldquo;Yes!&amp;rdquo;, of course. But that means you need to know your dependencies and dependents, your place in the larger scope of things. If also means you need to know what people your change will affect, and how to find them and to synchronize with them. If you do not know these things, you do not know how your change will affect these people, and that means you cannot safely roll out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s okay, we have training for that, and we can help you with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to #2 should be &amp;ldquo;Yes!&amp;rdquo;, again, or if cannot be that, it should be &amp;ldquo;but I know who can, and I made sure they are aware of my change and available for help&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So both of these rules are dealing with failure - anticipating and handling it properly. It&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure developer thinking, but we give these rules to feature developers. That&amp;rsquo;s a mind hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.048.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure thinking is really hard to explain to outsiders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.049.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in this document, the Linux &amp;ldquo;Code of Conflict&amp;rdquo;, what is being tried is to explain this - &amp;ldquo;There are people who will read your code, and they will evaluate it on how it fails, and how it changes failure before they even look at what it improves, because that is how Infrastructure works. Criticizing your code is not criticizing you, listen and learn.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also explains: &amp;ldquo;Criticizing you instead of your code is not okay, so if that happens, call out for help, please.&amp;rdquo; It uses many words for that, because somehow most non-infrastructure people are not used to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.051.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a certain type of experience associated with this kind of mindset. &amp;ldquo;Who here remembers this one?&amp;rdquo; When I asked the original audience of the talk about this incident, about 2/3 of the audience raised their hands. &amp;ldquo;I was there!&amp;rdquo; was being shouted by a few people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was at that point in time 14 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.052.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten years earlier, at Friday, the 13. May of 2005, I had to shut down 2MW of compute at the web.de data center, turning off the email for 25 million customers, because of a complete loss of cooling in the Data Center. We handled the incident, turned off the entire data center in less than 20 minutes in a chaotic rumble, and then back on to basic functionality with another two hours of work. Fully redundant and properly configured setup was reached again on Saturday, the 14th, around noon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People in the audience also remembered that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.053.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Infrastructure developers are averse to change. Change introduces unknown behavior, and unknown operating conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, if you are always ever judged by your failures, you focus on failure cases and how they are handled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.054.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does not have to be a contradiction, though. A sequence of rapid small changes acutally makes deployment risk smaller, and allows you to fail safely in many cases - in all cases, even, with a bit of engineering and good practice - see above, the discussion about events, monitoring and separation of rollout and activation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.056.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning for change and budgeting downtime can help a lot, even. Internally, we teach this as shown in the slides below: We have a failure budget, in lost potential income, and we expect to make use of it, even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.057.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look at what happened in a blameless postmortem process, and then write down what the takeaways from the outage are - how do we need to change processes, how to we need to improve monitoring and training, how do we need to fix code in order for that failure and that class of failure to go away?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.058.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talk about the concept of &amp;ldquo;Careful Carelessness&amp;rdquo;, which is what allows you to jump out of a plane several thousand meters up in the air, more than once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.060.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Careful&amp;rdquo; part of skydiving is important. You need training, you need to know and trust your buddies, you need a plan for safe landing, and you need alternative plans, tested and ready, and reviewed by others. You need to review their plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.064.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core concept is to make changes &amp;ldquo;survivable&amp;rdquo;, and then be able to execute the entire process in a way that it can be done often, without hurting. What is a project elsewhere, a one-off thing with additional staffing and a deadline, is a process for us, routinely, repeatedly done as part of normal operations, all of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what Devops is about: Making change a routine process of everyday operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.069.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Survivability&amp;rdquo; means to fail, or almost fail, but live to walk away and tell the tale. Because that is how we learn: When we succeed, we only confirm what we already know. When we fail, or almost fail, we learn a new thing, and we can share that experience with our peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only do we learn from failure, we also share common history and experience, and that builds better communication, validates judgement, and builds trust. This is how you forge a team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.071.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing in production is okay, if you engineer for it, and make it survivable. Even outside of rollouts, you can increase resilience by introducing chaos and variabilty in procedures - don&amp;rsquo;t shut down systems cleanly, always jank them out of production, or even install the chaos monkey. Always test in production, and find ways to do this safely. Also, this will help you find dependencies and metrics that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.076.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Seeger of NetUSE is famous for popularizing the proverb &amp;ldquo;Nobody wants Backup. Everybody needs Restore.&amp;rdquo; He wants to highlight the fact that Backups are just a cost center, and do not produce anything of value. The value - which needs to be proven - is in the successful Restore, and that is also what needs to be tested, constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, if you automate, you do not need backups for anything besides the (clearly defined and isolated) state. You can rebuild your systems at will, in regular intervals, or for testing purposes, and then inject the actually unique state into them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;and-yet-they-are-still-fighting&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#and-yet-they-are-still-fighting&#34;&gt;
	And yet, they are still fighting
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.077.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, Dev and Ops are still fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.078.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers tend to ignore operational complexity and toil, and often build from building blocks that look like rectangles on an architecture diagram, but are actually complex systems in themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Openstack Monasca, Monitoring as a Service:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Monasca is an open-source multi-tenant, highly scalable, performant, fault-tolerant monitoring-as-a-service solution that integrates with OpenStack. It uses a REST API for high-speed metrics processing and querying, and has a streaming alarm engine and a notification engine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It uses a number of underlying technologies; Apache Kafka, Apache Storm, Zookeeper, MySQL, Vagrant, Dropwizard, InfluxDB and Vertica.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At which point somebody in the audience usually shouts &amp;ldquo;Bingo!&amp;rdquo;. There are a number of questions here - for example, &amp;ldquo;How do you hire for this?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.083.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, looking at this Openstack Infrastructure Diagram (simplified): How do you operate this under &amp;ldquo;system behavior in failure state&amp;rdquo; as a success metric - which is how Infrastructure people think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.087.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure people see code like this coming in, and see people who package things they have not understood, taking on dependencies they do not know, and using practices that look like automated, repeatable procedures, but aren&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first line installs Homebrew - &amp;ldquo;Download an unreviewed script from Github and feed it to a shell, executing random foreign commands on your system&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second example shows a Dockerfile executing, but what looks like a build procedure is really just downloading binaries in tar files from elsewhere, unpacking and piling them on top of each other in a badly specified binary patch procedure, without caring much what is in these packages and how it is being made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last example is part of an Openstack Puppet install, and downloads an actual operating system package, then NOT installing it, but unpacking it and copying individual unregistered files into a production system image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.089.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or implementations of upgrade procedures with three nested loops (O(n^3) complexity), that work for l,m and n = 1 on a test laptop, but cannot possibly succeed in any production environment with significant values of l,m or n - clearly this has never seen an actual production environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.090.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This captures the essence of this mindset, cargo culting, containerism. Abstractions packed away deep in a fragile stack, and then in production suddenly breaking, taking down the entire technology Jenga tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.091.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer science is weird - it is hard, despite the fact that it is the science of zeroes and ones. Nothing individually in computer science is ever hard. It literally is as simple as Jenga or Tetris, and like these, the complexity comes from the layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have an exercise where I let people list the dependencies for their application going down from the business level all the way down to the silicon, and then we count layers stacked on top of each other. We usually can identify about three dozen levels of abstractions being piled on top of each other, all of them trivial or almost trivial. And that is on an isolated system, keeping the vagaries of distributed systems out of the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when we think about complexity in computer science, we speak about epsilon-delta in non-linear systems with cascading dependencies: A tiny change here has catastrophic outcomes elsewhere, 20 layers up or down the stack. You add a line of code, the working set of your application no longer fits into the CPU cache of low end CPU models, and suddenly the performance difference between the same code running on a Silver or Gold Xeon model is factor 20 and nobody even knows why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.096.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a new complaint. Alan Perlis famously quipped this about LISP programmers in 1982: The level of abstraction in LISP in 1982 was so high that native LISP programmers with no insight into the implementation created similar situations to the previous cache scenario, regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2015/03/devops-en.099.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In closing: What changes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devops means that Operations people become Infrastructure Developers. They are using the same tools that Feature Developers are using, but for a different purpose: For creating, scaling, maintaining and debugging the production environment of a project. For dealing with all the real world, failure related use-cases of a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devops means that the System Administrator as a job description goes away: There are only Infrastructure Developers now, or Operators - but these are people that follow instructions and will be ultimately replaced by machines soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devops means that as a System Administrator you have to learn the tools of a Developer, learn to automate, learn to talk to APIs, and learn how to apply Infrastructure thinking to other peoples codebases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Devops Engineer, or Infrastructure Developer, it is your task to keep the entire stack in mind. Applying Infrastructure thinking to this means you know how that change 20 levels down in the stack affects production on a grander scale - because somebody has to know the details and understand all the dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Devops Engineer you also need to teach enthusiastic young people with a feature developer mindset how to &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/08/31/on-touching-candles.html&#34;&gt;touch candles&lt;/a&gt;

, how to fail safely, in order to make them actually experience a problem class, instead of just abstractly knowing about it somewhere in the back of their mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do not do that, if you cannot do that, you will soon be replaced by a tiny shell script.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Einige kryptographische Grundlagen</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2011/06/03/einige-kryptographische-grundlagen.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Jun 2011 14:54:32 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2011/06/03/einige-kryptographische-grundlagen.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Heute gibt es hier alten Scheiß: Vor vielen Jahren, in einem anderen Leben,
habe ich im Rahmen der Ausbildung von Auszubildenden und Neuanstellungen
eine Reihe von Slides produziert, die einige Grundlagen der Kryptographie
erläutern, ohne daß das Ganze übermäßig mathematisch werden würde. Den Text
zu diesem Vortrag habe ich nie veröffentlicht, das hole ich hier einmal
nach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ziel des Textes war es einmal, den Leuten bestimmte kryptographische
Primitive und ihre Anwendung deutlich zu machen sowie die Rechtslage mit der
Technik zu verknüpfen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weil ich uns allen die Mathematik erspart habe, muß man einige Annahmen
glauben, anstatt sich durch die entsprechenden mathematischen Beweise zu
kämpfen. Und zwar muß man glauben, daß es Algorithmen gibt, die in einer
Richtung leicht und mit wenig Aufwand durchzuführen sind (etwa die
Multiplikation einiger Zahlen), aber in der umgekehrten Richtung sehr
aufwendig sind, weil keine Abkürzung existiert (etwa die Umkehrung einer
Multiplikation: die Bestimmung der unbekannten Faktoren, die ein bestimmtes
bekanntes Multiplikationsergebnis ergeben).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mit Hilfe solcher Algorithmen kann man dann Verschlüsselungssysteme bauen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Mathematik, die dem zugrunde liegt, ist von den Mathematikern auch sehr
gut verstanden und allgemein bekannt und untersucht. In der Regel ist es
auch nicht die Mathematik, die defekt ist, wenn ein Kryptosystem gehackt
wird, sondern es ist die umgebende Infrastruktur, die kaputt geht:
Zufallszahlengeneratoren, die keine zufälligen Zahlen produzieren oder
Verwaltungssysteme für geheime Schlüssel, die geheimzuhaltende Daten
herausgeben. Oder halt der Fehler, sich selbst einen
Verschlüsselungsalgorithmus auszudenken ohne die entsprechende Mathematik zu
beherrschen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/kryptogrundlagen/img0.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aber von vorne:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eine der Grundaufgaben in der Kryptographie ist ein Sender, Andreas, der
einer Empfängerin, Birgit, eine Nachricht senden möchte, ohne daß Dritte
mithören können. Die Nachricht wird als Message (M) bezeichnet.
Verschlüsselt wird sie mit einer Verschlüsselungsfunktion, die allgemein
bekannt und gut untersucht ist, und diese Funktion braucht einen geheimen
Schlüssel, den Key (K).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathematiker sind faule Säue, sie können sich nicht einmal aufraffen,
Multiplikationspunkte zu schreiben (und schreiben also A*B einfach als AB).
Entsprechend sollten sie die Formel C = f(K, M) (der verschlüsselte
Ciphertext C ergibt sich aus der Anwendung der Verschlüsselungsfunktion f,
die die Nachricht M und den Schlüssel K als Parameter hat) schreiben.
Stattdessen notieren sie oft falsch C = K(M), als ob K eine Funktion und
nicht der Schlüssel wäre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/kryptogrundlagen/img1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andreas verschlüsselt seine Nachricht an Birgit, weil er sich bedroht fühlt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn man sich mit Sicherheitsdingen beschäftigt, ist es wichtig, diese
Bedrohung auszuformulieren und die Ziele und Fähigkeiten des Angreifers zu
benennen. Nur aus diesen Listen kann man die Gefahren ableiten und dann
sagen, ob bestimmte vorgeschlagene Maßnahmen eine sinnvolle Abwehr gegen
die Bedrohung darstellen oder nicht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man kann diesen Effekt gar nicht genug betonen: Wenn man sich mit Laien
(oder in der Politik) über Bedrohungen unterhält, dann diskutieren diese
Sicherheit oftmals in den Begriffen von Maßnahmen, anstatt über Angreifer,
Bedrohungen, Eintrittswahrscheinlichkeiten und Schadenshöhen zu reden und
die Maßnahmen anhang dieser Dinge auszuwählen oder zu bewerten. Das erzeugt
dann jede Menge operative Hektik, verbessert die Sicherheit aber in der
Regel kein Stück.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das Schutzziel eines Kryptosystems ist gewissermaßen das Gegenteil eines
Angriffes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein Kryptosystem kann das Ziel haben, den Inhalt einer Nachricht geheim zu
halten, d.h. nur der Absender und der Empfänger einer Nachricht können ihren
Inhalt kennen, Dritte nicht. Eine schwächere Forderung wäre, eine Nachricht
integer zu halten, also Veränderungen der Nachricht durch Dritte erkennbar
zu machen. Eine stärkere Forderung wäre, nicht nur den Inhalt einer
Nachricht vertraulich zu halten, sondern die Tatsache, daß zwei bestimmte
Personen überhaupt miteinander kommuniziert haben zu verbergen -
Unbeobachtbarkeit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man kann fordern, die Identitäten des Senders und des Empfängers voreinander
zu verbergen - dann hat man Anonymität. Oder man kann fordern, daß die
Identitäten des Senders und des Empfängers beweisbar bekannt und unfälschbar
sind, dann bekommt man Authentizität.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man kann fordern, daß ein System durch gefälschte oder defekte Nachrichten
nicht offline gezwungen werden kann, daß es also verfügbar bleibt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angreifer können versuchen, diese Schutzziele zu vereiteln, etwa indem man
ihnen die Fähigkeit zugesteht, die Kommunikation mitzuhören, mitgehörte
Nachrichten wiederholt abzusenden, Nachrichten zu verändern, sich in die
Kommunikationskette zwischen Sender und Empfänger einzuschleichen und sich
für die jeweilige Gegenstelle auszugeben, oder indem sie versuchen, die
Kommunikation zwischen den beiden Parteien zu unterbrechen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man kann sehr starke Angreifer konstruieren, indem man ihnen die Fähigkeit
zugesteht, die Hardware oder Systemsoftware des Senders oder des Empfängers
von diesem unbemerkt zu verändern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Und man muß Einsatzzwecke von Kryptographie unterscheiden: Es besteht ein
grundlegender Unterschied in den Anforderungen zwischen
Transportverschlüsselung (etwa das Abrufen von Webseiten über SSL) und
Speicherverschlüsselung (etwa dem Ablegen von Dateien auf einer
verschlüsselten Festplatte).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bei Transportverschlüsselung hat man in der Regel die Anforderung, daß es
keine &amp;lsquo;Key Recovery&amp;rsquo; geben darf - nur der Sender und der Empfänger sollen
den vereinbarten Schlüssel K kennen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bei Speicherverschlüsselung dagegen hat man vielfach weitergehende
Anforderungen. Ein Arbeitgeber zum Beispiel wird auf den Laptops seiner
Mitarbeiter nicht Festplattenverschlüsselung ausrollen können, wenn er nicht
die Möglichkeit hat, auch ohne Kooperation des Mitarbeiters auf dessen
dienstliche Daten zugreifen zu können. Ohne diese Möglichkeit besteht sonst
die Gefahr, daß betriebskritische Daten für die Firma nicht mehr im Zugriff
sind, wenn der Mitarbeiter erkrankt oder sonstwie nicht mehr verfügbar ist.
Diese Situation ist für eine Firma klar nicht akzeptabel, daher müssen
solche Systeme immer &amp;ldquo;Key Recovery&amp;rdquo; erlauben, also eine &amp;ldquo;Hintertür&amp;rdquo; haben,
die - und das ist der entscheidende Punkt - unter der Kontrolle der Firma
steht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speicherverschlüsselung ohne Key Recovery ist wertlos, und das entscheidende
Merkmal bei der Diskussion über Key Recovery ist nicht, daß sie existiert,
sondern wer die Kontrolle über die Recovery Keys hat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auguste Kerckhoffs hat 1883 das
&lt;a href=&#34;http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%E2%80%99_Prinzip&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Kerckhoffsche Prinzip&lt;/a&gt;


formuliert. Kerckhoffs war ein früher Kryptograph, und hat kryptographische
Verfahren untersucht und eine Reihe von Anforderungen an Kryptosysteme
formuliert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In einer modernen Formulierung besagt das Kerckhoffsche Prinzip, daß die
Sicherheit eines Kryptosystems nicht von der Geheimhaltung des verwendeten
Algorithmus abhängen darf, sondern nur von der Geheimhaltung der verwendeten
Schlüssel abhängen darf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In einer schärferen Formulierung kann man sogar sagen, daß ein Kryptosystem,
dessen Algorithmen nicht allgemein bekannt und durch viele anerkannte
Kryptographen untersucht und bestätigt worden sind wahrscheinlich unsicher
ist und nicht verwendet werden sollte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir können nach dem heutigen Stand der Mathematik nicht beweisen, daß ein
Algorithmus unangreifbar ist. Wir können lediglich unsere hellsten Köpfe auf
einen Algorithmus loslassen. Wenn die dann alle scheitern (und was das
bedeutet klären wir gleich), dann ist der Algorithmus wahrscheinlich zur
Zeit sicher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es gibt in der Geschichte der Kryptographie eine ganze Menge Beispiele für
recht prominent selbstgekochte Kryptosysteme, bei denen die Algorithmen
nicht ausreichend untersucht worden sind und die sich dann im Nachhinein
nicht als sicher erwiesen haben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Scramble_System#Cryptanalysis&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CSS&lt;/a&gt;

-System
zur Verschlüsselung von DVD-Inhalten ist zum Beispiel ein solches System:
Nicht nur ist seine Schlüssellänge mit 40 Bit sowieso zu kurz, sondern durch
eine Analyse des Algorithmus, die bei der Erschaffung von CSS nicht
ausreichend durchgeführt worden ist, ist es gelungen, die effektive
Schlüssellänge dieser 40 Bit auf 16 Bit zu reduzieren. Damit ist aber ein
Angriff auf CSS mit trivialer Rechenleistung möglich und CSS ist in etwa
genau so sicher wie Klartext.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein anderes Beispiel ist der vom GSM-Konsortium selbstgekochte
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A5/1#Security&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;A5&lt;/a&gt;

 Algorithmus, mit dem einige
Mobilfunkbetreiber GSM-Kommunikation verschlüsselt haben, statt einen
anerkannten Algorithmus zu nehmen. Auch die verschiedenen Varianten von A5
sind gebrochen worden und mit diesen (inzwischen nicht mehr verwendeten)
Algorithmen verschlüsselte Kommunikation ist abhörbar geworden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jedes Verschlüsselungsverfahren läßt sich brechen, indem man einfach alle
möglichen Schlüssel durchprobiert. Diesen Angriff nennt man einen &amp;lsquo;brute
force&amp;rsquo;-Angriff. Damit er gelingen kann, müssen zwei Dinge gelten:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Einmal muß man überhaupt mitbekommen, daß man fertig ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bei einem Brute Force-Angriff entschlüsselt man eine verschlüsselte
Nachricht (also unlesbaren Bitsalat) mit dem falschen Schlüssel (bekommt
also anderen unlesbaren Bitsalat). Erwischt man zufällig den korrekten
Schlüssel, bekommt man lesbaren Text - und muß diese Situation erkennen. Das
heißt, es hilft, wenn man ein wenig über den Klartext weiß (&amp;rsquo;es handet sich
um englischen Text&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;am Ende des Textes ist eine CRC32 Prüfsumme über alle
vorhergehenden Bytes und wenn die Prüfsumme aufgeht, ist die Nachricht
korrekt&amp;rsquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hat man solches Wissen nicht, muß man raten - etwa wenn die Nachricht nur
gültige Zeichen in dem und dem Zeichensatz enthält und die relativen
Häufigkeiten der Buchstaben in etwa dem Muster englischer Sprache
entsprechen, dann ist die Nachricht möglicherweise korrekt entschlüsselt
worden und man legt sie einem Operator zur Kontrolle vor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Im zweiten Weltkrieg zum Beispiel haben die Engländer die mit der Engima
verschlüsselten Nachrichten deutscher U-Boote abgefangen. Diese U-Boote
haben wichtige Nachrichten mit dem Flottenkommando ausgetauscht, aber auch
Wetternachrichten an das Kommando zurück gesendet. Diese Wetternachrichten
waren jedoch mit demselben Schlüssel verschlüsselt, der auch für andere
wichtige Nachrichten verwendet worden ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn man nun also das Wetter an der Position des U-Bootes kennt und weiß,
wie ein militärischer Wetterbericht abgefaßt wird, dann kann man den Klartext
der Wettermeldung des U-Bootes recht gut vorhersagen und hat eine gute
Stop-Bedingung für einen Brute Force-Angriff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zum anderen muß man fertig werden können. Das heißt, der Schlüsselraum (alle
möglichen K) muß klein genug sein, daß man im Verhältnis zur
Arbeitsgeschwindigkeit seiner Entschlüsselungsmaschine die Möglichkeit hat,
alle Schlüssel in einem gegebenen Zeitrahmen durchzuprobieren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn man weiß, daß die Nachricht etwa das Datum des Angriffes eines Gegners
enthält (&amp;lsquo;Angriff im Morgengrauen!&amp;rsquo;), dann ist die Nachricht wertlos,
nachdem der Angriff des Gegners erfolgt ist. Ist der Schlüsselraum so groß,
daß es unmöglich ist, die verschlüsselte abgefangene Nachricht vor dem
Morgengrauen zu entschlüsseln, indem man alle möglichen Schlüssel
durchprobiert, dann ist das Verfahren &lt;em&gt;sicher&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man muß also die Schlüssellänge so wählen, daß sie der benötigten
Schutzfrist gegen einen Brute Force-Angriff genügt. Angenommen, man hätte
&lt;a href=&#34;http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstagswahl_1933&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;1933&lt;/a&gt;

 elektronisch wählen
können und jemand hätte die Wahlnachrichten mit Absenderkennungen damals
aufzeichnen, aber nicht entschlüsseln können - wie lange muß ein solches
System die Nachrichten dann also gegen Brute Force schützen können
(technologischen Fortschritt eingerechnet)? Muß ein militärisches System für
taktische Kommunikation (&amp;lsquo;Angriff im Morgengrauen&amp;rsquo;) oder ein elektronisches
Wahlsystem sicherer sein? Wieviel sicherer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darum haben wir keine Wahlcomputer und keine elektronischen Wahlen über
Netzwerk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn es neben dem Brute Force-Angriff noch andere Methoden gibt, mit denen
man den Schlüssel K ermitteln kann und diese anderen Methoden effizienter
sind als Brute Force, dann gilt das System als &lt;em&gt;gebrochen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man beachte, daß das etwas anderes ist als &lt;em&gt;unsicher&lt;/em&gt;. Es gibt unsichere
Systeme, die nicht gebrochen sind - DES ist so etwas zum Beispiel. DES ist
ein Verfahren mit einer Schlüssellänge von nur 56 Bit, und die
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eff.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;EFF&lt;/a&gt;

 hat 1998 den Spezialrechner
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFF_DES_cracker&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Deep Crack&lt;/a&gt;

 gebaut, um DES in
wenigen Stunden zu brute forcen. DES ist aber nicht gebrochen - es ist kein
Verfahren bekannt, mit dem es möglich wäre, die 2^56 Schlüssel abzukürzen.
Daher kann man unsichere DES noch verwenden, um das
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_DES#Security&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;sichere&lt;/a&gt;

 und ungebrochene
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFF_DES_cracker&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Triple DES&lt;/a&gt;

 zu konstruieren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andererseits existiert der DES-Nachfolger
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;AES&lt;/a&gt;

. AES 256
hat einen K-Raum mit 2^256 Einträgen, aber AES ist
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard#Known_attacks&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;gebrochen&lt;/a&gt;

 -
der K-Raum ist auf 2^200 Einträge reduziert, also kleiner als Brute Force.
Allerdings ist diese Zahl immer noch zu groß, daß der Algorithmus als sicher
gilt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/kryptogrundlagen/img3.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DES und AES sind beides symmetrische Verfahren. Das sind Verfahren, bei
denen man eine Nachricht mit demselben Schlüssel entschlüsseln kann, den man
zur Verschlüsselung verwendet. Man bekommt also den Ciphertext C = K(M), und
indem man K noch einmal anwendet, bekommt man die Nachricht zurück: M =
K(C), d.h. M = K(K(M)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symmetrische Verfahren haben vergleichsweise kurze Schlüssel: das unsichere
DES hat nur 56 Bit, das sichere 3DES hat 112 Bit und AES sollte man mit 256
Bit betreiben, damit es sicher ist. Da die Laufzeit eines
Verschlüsselungsalgorithmus in vielen Fällen proportional zur Länge der
Schlüssel ist, sind die meisten symmetrischen Verfahren relativ schnell -
speziell AES ist außerdem auch so entwickelt worden, daß es sich auf heute
üblichen Prozessoren leicht implementieren läßt und ist daher sehr gut
geeignet, wenn es auf Geschwindigkeit ankommt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das Hauptproblem von symmetrischen Verfahren ist, daß sich der Sender und
der Empfänger auf einen Schlüssel einigen müssen. Wie kommt der Schlüssel K,
mit dem Andreas seine Nachrichten an Birgit verschlüsselt, zu Birgit, wenn
Andreas doch der Strecke zwischen Andreas und Birgit nicht trauen kann?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manchmal kann man das Problem dadurch lösen, daß der Schlüssel so angenehm
kurz ist: Nehmen wir an, daß Andreas seiner Internet-Verbindung zu Birgit
nicht traut, aber seiner Telefonverbindung - dies nennen wir einen sicheren
Kanal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eine Eigenschaft von sicheren Kanälen ist, daß ihre Kapaziät oft begrenzt
ist - entweder in der Menge oder in der Zeit, zu der sie verfügbar sind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zum Beispiel ist es für Andreas nicht möglich, Birgit sein neustes, viele
hundert Kilobyte großes Paper am Telefon zu diktieren. Er kann aber durchaus
die Hex-Repräsentation des von ihm gewählten Schlüssels K diktieren und ihr
dann die mit K verschlüsselte Nachricht senden, die das Paper enthält. Das
ist ein Beispiel für einen in der Kapazität beschränkten sicheren Kanal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oder Andreas hat Birgit im Januar auf einer Konferenz getroffen und mit ihr
ein gemeinsames K ausgemacht. Jetzt, im Juni, will er ihr sein Paper senden.
Das geht, da die beiden ja einen gemeinsamen Schlüssel K haben. Dies ist ein
Beispiel für einen temporal beschränkten sicheren Kanal - damals hatten sie
sichere Kommunikation, jetzt nicht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein extremes Beispiel für so etwas hat man, wenn der Schlüssel so lang ist
wie die Nachricht selber. In diesem Fall kann man tatsächlich absolut
sichere Kommunikation konstruieren: Man nehme einen physikalischen
Zufallszahlengenerator, etwa den Zerfall einer radioaktiven Probe, und
zeichne die Zahlen auf, 700 MB davon auf einer CD. Dann mache man eine Kopie
davon und sende diese mit einem Kurier zum Empfänger oder übergebe diese dem
Empfänger, wenn man ihn trifft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Später, wenn man Bedarf an sicherer Kommunikation hat, sendet man dem
Empfänger die Nachricht XOR-codiert mit diesen Zufallszahlen, und streiche
diese Zahlen sodaß sie niemals wieder verwendet werden können.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dieses Verfahren nennt sich
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;One-Time Pad&lt;/a&gt;

 und ist das
einzige bekannte Verfahren, das absolut und beweisbar sicher ist.
Bedingungen: Der Schlüssel wird niemals wiederverwendet (daher die
Notwendigkeit des Abstreichens) und der Schlüssel ist echt zufällig (und
nicht von einer Pseudo-Zufallszahlenfunktion berechnet). Leider gibt es sehr
viele Anbieter von Verfahren, die sich One-Time Pad nennen, aber entweder
den Schlüssel wiederverwenden oder nicht wirklich zufällig bestimmen - diese
Verfahren sind leider sehr, sehr leicht brechbar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symmetrische Verfahren haben noch ein anderes Problem, wenn es um
Gruppenkommunikation geht: Für jede Kombination von Sender und Empfänger muß
man einen anderen Schlüssel vereinbaren, wenn dieses Paar privat und
unabhängig von den anderen Paarungen miteinander kommunizieren können soll.
Daher hat man bei n Teilnehmern (n*(n-1))/2 mögliche K zu verwalten, bei 100
Teilnehmern also 4950 verschiedene Schlüssel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/kryptogrundlagen/img4.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Um dieses Problem besser beherrschen zu können hat man in den 1970er Jahren
asymmetrische Verfahren entwickelt. Ein asymmetrisches Verfahren ist eines,
bei dem man einen Verschlüssel P und einen Entschlüssel Q hat. Wenn man also
den Ciphertext C = P(M) produziert, dann braucht man den anderen Schlüssel Q
um wieder an den Klartext zu kommen: M = Q(C), d.h. M = Q(P(M)). Wendet man
stattdessen P ein zweites Mal an, bekommt man kein sinnvolles Ergebnis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tatsächlich funktioniert die Paarung auch anders herum: Ich kann auch mit Q
verschlüsseln und dieses Resultat dann mit P entschlüsseln, d.h. es gilt
auch M = P(Q(M)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Unterscheidung zwischen P und Q ist also nicht technisch-funktional: Ich
kann jeweils mit dem einen Schlüssel entschlüsseln, was mit dem anderen
verschlüsselt worden ist. Sie ist stattdessen organisatorisch: Den einen
Schlüssel, P, mache ich publik. Den anderen, Q, halte ich streng geheim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Empfänger einer Nachricht kann nun also seinen öffentlichen Schlüssel P
publizieren: Birgit macht ihr P allgemein bekannt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein Sender kann sich nun diesen öffentlichen Schlüssel P von Birgit greifen
und eine Nachricht an sie verschlüsseln: C = P(M). Es ist nicht möglich,
diese Nachricht mit P wieder zu entschlüsseln. Nur Birgit (oder jede andere
Person, die aus welchen Gründen auch immer ihr Q kennt) kann die Nachricht
wieder in Klartext verwandeln: M = Q(C) = Q(P(M)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Anzahl der zu verwaltenden Schlüssel ist in so einem Setup deutlich
kleiner: Statt 4950 Schlüsseln für 100 Teilnehmer sind nur 100 PQ-Paare zu
verwalten, genauer: Es muß ein Verzeichnis von 100 öffentlichen Schlüsseln P
der Empfänger bekannt gemacht werden, und die 100 geheimen Schlüssel müssen
von den Empfängern auch geheim gehalten werden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein Nachteil: Asymmetrische Verfahren haben deutlich längere Schlüssel als
symmetrische Verfahren. Schlüssel sind bis zu 4096 Bit lang. Daher ist auch
ihre Verarbeitung sehr viel langsamer, im Schnitt 10-20 mal langsamer als
bei den bekannten symmetrischen Verfahren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/kryptogrundlagen/img5.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In der Praxis verwendet man daher meist hybride Verfahren. Bei einem
hybriden Verfahren wird symmetrische Verschlüsselung angewendet, um die
Nachricht zu verschlüsseln. Der Schlüssel K, mit dem das getan wird, wird
dabei zufällig ausgewürfelt und nur ein einziges Mal (oder bei einer
stehenden Verbindung nur für kurze Zeit) verwendet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Empfänger muß K gesagt bekommen - dafür verwenden wir das asymmetrische
Verfahren, und das ist schnell, weil die Nachricht selber (es steht nur K
drin) recht kurz ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andreas würfelt sich also einen Key K aus, den &amp;ldquo;Session-Key&amp;rdquo;. Dann greift er
sich den öffentlichen Schlüssel P von Birgit und verschlüsselt K damit:
P(K). Die eigentliche Nachricht M verschlüsselt er dann mit K, weil&amp;rsquo;s
schneller ist: K(M).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birgit bekommt die Nachricht &amp;ldquo;P(K) K(M)&amp;rdquo;. Mit ihrem geheimen Schlüssel Q
kann sie K = Q(P(K)) ermitteln. Dadurch kennt sie K und kann nun M = K(K(M))
berechnen, und hat nun die Nachricht im Klartext.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/kryptogrundlagen/img6.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir können den Session-Key der Nachricht sogar mehrfach voranstellen:
P&lt;sub&gt;birgit&lt;/sub&gt;(K) P&lt;sub&gt;marit&lt;/sub&gt;(K) und so weiter. Alle diese
Empfänger können nun ihre Kopie des Session-Key entschlüsseln und die
Nachricht decodieren. Dabei muß man sich erinnern, daß K(M) recht lang sein
kann, die ganze Nachricht halt. Die einzelnen Kopien des Session-Keys sind
jedoch recht kurz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dies ist auch die Idee verschiedener DRM-Systeme, um etwa den Inhalt von
DVDs zu schützen: Auf der DVD befindet sich der Video-Content mit dem
Session-Key der DVD geschützt, viele GB lang. Im Startbereich der DVD ist
der Session-Key mit dem geheimen Schlüssel des jeweiligen
Player-Lizenznehmers geschützt abgelegt. Der Hersteller mit der
Herstellernummer 48 guckt also im 48. Slot vorne auf der DVD nach,
entschlüsselt den Session-Key der DVD von dort und kann so die DVD
abspielen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das wäre angreifbar in dem Sinne, daß dazu ja der geheime Schlüssel jedes
Lizenznehmers in jedem seiner Produke - den Playern - enthalten sein müßte,
und tatsächlich hat man diese Schlüssel auch für kurze Zeit aus
Software-DVD-Spielern extrahiert, bis man gemerkt hatte, daß das
symmetrische Verschlüsselungsverfahren, CSS, auf einer DVD sowieso Schrott
ist und man sich das Lesen der Keys aus dem Index vorne auch sparen kann&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es verbleiben zwei zu lösende Probleme:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erstens: Wir müssen irgendwie sicherstellen, daß der Schlüssel, der uns als
der Schlüssel von Birgit im Verzeichnis verkauft wird auch wirklich der
Schlüssel ist, der zu Birgits Q paßt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zweitens: Bei einigen Nachrichten sollte man sicherstellen, daß nicht
irgendjemand auf dem Weg C = K(M) abfängt und ein zweites Mal abspielt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn Andreas etwa eine Nachricht an Birgit sendet &amp;ldquo;Bitte zahle Kris 100 EUR
aus.&amp;rdquo; und Kris fängt diese Nachricht ab, dann kann er Birgit eventuell dazu
bringen, ihm jedesmal 100 EUR auszuzahlen, wenn er diese verschlüsselte
Nachricht noch einmal sendet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dieses zweite Problem läßt sich lösen, indem man der Nachricht eine
Folgenummer oder eine Zufallszahl verpaßt, die mit codiert wird - am besten
beides. Nachrichten gleichen Inhaltes werden dadurch unterscheidbar und
Duplikate können erkannt werden. Es ist natürlich wichtig, daß diese Zahlen
mit verschlüsselt werden, damit sie nicht leicht zu ändern sind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/kryptogrundlagen/img7.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verschlüsselungsverfahren arbeiten in Blöcken von x Bits. Nachrichten sind
jedoch nicht immer genau Vielfache dieser Blöcke lang. Daher muß man sie
durch Füllbytes am Ende zu einem solchen Blockvielfachen auffüllen - das
nennt man Padding. Man bekommt eine Nachricht M, die in Wirklichkeit aus
Teilnachrichten besteht. Jede Teilnachricht ist einen solchen Block lang:
M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;hellip; M&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;hellip; und so
weiter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danach wird das Verschlüsselungsverfahren angewendet, und zwar auf jeden
Block. Dabei kann jeder Block mit demselben Schlüssel K verschlüsselt
werden, oder mit einem Schlüssel, der irgendwie aus dem Startschlüssel K,
dem Blockindex i, vorhergehenden Blöcken von Klartext oder Ciphertext oder
einem weiteren Startwert (dem Initialisierungsvektor IV, eine weitere
Zufallszahl) abgeleitet wird. Je nachdem, wie man sich diese Dinge
zusammenbastelt, handelt man sich bestimmte Vor- und Nachteile ein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verfahren, bei denen die Verschlüsselung von M&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; nicht von
vorhergehendem Klartext oder Ciphertext abhängig sind, sind gut
parallelisierbar und sind auch unempfindlich gegen Leitungsstörungen oder
Plattenlesefehler, bei denen eventuell einmal ein Block zwischendrin
verloren geht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/kryptogrundlagen/img8.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/kryptogrundlagen/img9.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/kryptogrundlagen/img10.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verschüsselt man mit einem festen Schlüssel K (&amp;lsquo;Electronic Codebook&amp;rsquo;, ECB),
dann werden zwei Blöcke M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; und M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, die denselben
Inhalt haben, auch gleich verschlüsselt - der Klartext der Nachricht scheint
im Ciphertext durch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;0002020 72 d6 ba 5e 91 0a 9e 90
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;0002030
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erzeugt man also ein Kilobyte Nullbytes und verschlüsselt diese mit einem
ECB-Verfahren (jeden Block also mit demselben Schlüssel &amp;lsquo;keks&amp;rsquo;), dann
bekommt man zwar Bytesalat, aber Bytesalat mit einem sich wiederholenden
Muster: Alle 32 Bytes kommt dieselbe Bytefolge vor - &lt;em&gt;od&lt;/em&gt; erkennt das und
kürzt ab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durch verschiedene Verfahren versucht man dies zu verhindern, indem man
einen Block mit seinem vorhergehenden Klartext oder Ciphertext mischt.
Dennoch ist es sinnvoll, Klartext vor der Verschlüsselung zu komprimieren:
Kompression beseitigt Redundanzen im Klartext. Sich wiederholende Muster
werden ausgenutzt, um die Nachrichtenlänge zu verkleinern und es entsteht
eine Klartextnachricht, die keine Muster mehr enthält.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/kryptogrundlagen/img11.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neben Verschlüsselungsalgorithmen gibt es ein zweites wichtiges
Grundkonstrukt in der Kryptographie, den Hash. Ein Hash ist eine
Prüfsummenfunktion, also etwas, in das man eine beliebig lange Nachricht
vorne reinfüttern darf, und bei der dann am Ende eine Zahl h mit einer
festen Anzahl von Bits herauskommt: h = Hash(M).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allen Prüfsummen ist gemeinsam, daß man aus einer gegebenen Prüfsumme die
Originalnachricht nicht eindeutig rekonstruieren kann, da es mehr als eine
Nachricht gibt, die diese Prüfsumme hat. Das gilt selbst für eine
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number#ISBN-10&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ISBN&lt;/a&gt;

:
Die ISBN 0-306-40615 hat die Prüfzummer 2, aber es gibt noch weitere ISBNs,
die diese Prüfziffer haben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bei einer ISBN ist es jedoch relativ leicht, eine ISBN zu konstruieren, die
eine bestimmte vorgegebene Prüfziffer (hier: 2) hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bei einer kryptographischen Prüfsumme, einem Hash, möchte man nun als
zusätzliche Eigenschaft, daß es nicht möglich sein soll, eine Nachricht M zu
konstruieren, die eine bestimmte Prüfsumme h ergibt. Um so eine Nachricht zu
finden, müßte man idealerweise den ganzen M-Raum durchsuchen (also einen
Brute Force-Angriff starten).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In der Praxis gibt es einige populäre Funktionen, von denen wir geglaubt
haben, daß sie diese Eigenschaft hätten und das ist auch eine Weile gut
gegangen. Derzeit sieht es aber eher schlecht aus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/kryptogrundlagen/img12.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir können Hashes verwenden, um Daten digital zu unterschreiben. Nehmen wir
an, Andreas will Birgit eine Nachricht M senden und er will sicherstellen,
daß Birgit erkennen kann, daß es sich um eine unveränderte Nachricht handelt
und daß sie von Andreas ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dazu nehmen wir einen Klartext M und berechnen die Prüfsumme Hash(M).
Andreas verschlüsselt nun die Prüfsumme mit seinem &lt;em&gt;geheimen&lt;/em&gt; Schlüssel
Q&lt;sub&gt;Andreas&lt;/sub&gt;. Etwas, das mit Q verschlüsselt worden ist, kann mit dem
dazu gehörenden P entschlüsselt werden und umgekehrt. Die Prüfsumme kann
also mit dem Public Key von Andreas entschlüsselt werden - und der ist
jedermann bekannt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn wir also die Nachricht M nehmen und selber die Prüfsumme h = Hash(M)
berechnen, dann können wir dieses Ergebnis mit der Prüfsumme vergleichen,
die Andreas mit seinem private Key verschlüsselt hat und die jeder
entschlüsseln kann, der den public Key von Andreas kennt. Stimmen beide
überein, wissen wir, daß die Nachricht unverändert ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Unverändert&amp;rdquo; (oder authentisch) bedeutet hier, daß der Inhalt der
Nachricht, den wir sehen, identisch ist mit dem Inhalt der Nachricht, die
jemand abgesendet hat, der den private Key von Andreas gekannt hat. Wenn
Andreas also seine Schlüsselverwaltung im Griff hat, dann ist das nur
Andreas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andreas sendet &amp;ldquo;M Q&lt;sub&gt;Andreas&lt;/sub&gt;(Hash(M))&amp;rdquo; und nicht
&amp;ldquo;Q&lt;sub&gt;Andreas&lt;/sub&gt;(M)&amp;rdquo;. Beweistechnisch macht das keinen Unterschied: In
beiden Fällen muß der Absender der Nachricht den geheimen Schlüssel von
Andreas gekannt haben. Im ersten Fall ist die Nachricht jedoch auch dann
noch lesbar, wenn der Empfänger der Nachricht keinen Zugriff auf den
öffentlichen Schlüssel von Andreas hat (dann ist jedoch die Authentizität
nicht beweisbar).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Prüfsumme Q&lt;sub&gt;Andreas&lt;/sub&gt;(Hash(M)) hinter der Nachricht M nennt man
auch eine digitale Unterschrift (Signatur) der Nachricht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/kryptogrundlagen/img13.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dieses Verfahren kann man jetzt mit der hybriden Verschlüsselung
zusammensetzen. Man bekommt ein Verfahren, bei dem man eine Nachricht
erzeugt, die aus der Nachricht M und ihrer Signatur
Q&lt;sub&gt;Andreas&lt;/sub&gt;(Hash(M)) zusammengesetzt ist. Nachricht und Signatur
werden jetzt mit einem Session-Key K verschlüsselt: &amp;ldquo;K(M
Q&lt;sub&gt;Andreas&lt;/sub&gt;(Hash(M)))&amp;rdquo; und der Session-Key K wird mit dem
öffentliche Schlüssel des Empfängers verschlüsselt vorangestellt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das Gesamtprodukt: &amp;ldquo;P&lt;sub&gt;Birgit&lt;/sub&gt;(K) K(M
Q&lt;sub&gt;Andreas&lt;/sub&gt;(Hash(M)))&amp;rdquo;. Nur Birgit kann nun den Session-Key K
ermitteln, und mit dessen Hilfe Nachricht und Signatur aus der Nachricht
extrahieren. Sie kann dann die Prüfsumme über die Nachricht selbst berechnen
und mit dem öffentlichen Schlüssel von Andreas gegen die Prüfsumme in der
Nachricht vergleichen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/kryptogrundlagen/img14.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was jetzt noch fehlt ist ein Weg, mit dem Andreas und Birgit und jeder sonst
an die öffentlichen Schlüssel aller anderen kommt, ohne daß irgendein
Angreifer etwa Andreas den Schlüssel eines Angreifers im Namen von Birgit
unterschrieben kann und Birgit den Schlüssel des Angreifers im Namen von
Andreas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damit man das kann, muß man die Identität von Personen an Schlüssel binden.
Das macht man mit einem Zertifikat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein Zertifikat ist eine Datenstruktur, die einen öffentlichen Schlüssel
enthält, den Namen oder andere Identifikationsdaten des Inhabers, einen
Verwendungszweck für den Schlüssel (Garantien, die der Inhaber für Daten
abgibt, die mit diesem Schlüssel signiert sind) und eine Laufzeit als
Intervall von-bis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jede dieser Informationen hat eine spezifische Aufgabe in unserem System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der öffentlichen Schlüssel P erlaubt das Entschlüsseln von Prüfsummen, also
das Prüfen von Signaturen. Er erlaubt auch das Verschlüsseln von Nachrichten
an einen Empfänger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Inhaberdaten definieren, was für ein Empfänger ist. Der Empfänger ist
immer eine natürliche Person, denn zu einem öffentlichen Schlüssel gehört
immer auch ein geheimer Schlüssel, und es ist unmöglich, den geheimen
Schlüssel geheim zu halten, wenn er nicht an eine natürliche Person gebunden
ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empfänger, die juristische Personen sind, muß man über Personengruppen oder
über Verwendungszwecke/Rollen simulieren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Laufzeit schließlich ist nützlich, weil sie einige häßliche
Skalierungsprobleme in unserem System begrenzen hilft. Dazu später mehr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hinten an diesem Zertifikat steht dann ein weiteres Datenpaket - die
Signatur einer CA, einer Certification Authority. Sie &amp;ldquo;beglaubigt&amp;rdquo; diese
Daten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/kryptogrundlagen/img15.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das Problem, das wir lösen wollen: Wir kann Andreas sicher sein, daß
P&lt;sub&gt;Birgit&lt;/sub&gt; wirklich von Birgit stammt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Ansatz mit einer CA definiert &lt;strike&gt;einen Single Point of
Failure&lt;/strike&gt; eine Zertifikations-Station, die einen Schlüssel
P&lt;sub&gt;CA&lt;/sub&gt; veröffentlicht, etwa dadurch, daß dieser in einem Browser
eingebaut ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birgit publiziert nun nicht P&lt;sub&gt;Birgit&lt;/sub&gt;, sondern
Q&lt;sub&gt;CA&lt;/sub&gt;(Hash(P&lt;sub&gt;Birgit&lt;/sub&gt;)) P&lt;sub&gt;Birgit&lt;/sub&gt;. Die CA
verschlüsselt also die Prüfsumme über den Schlüssel von Birgit und Birgit
fügt diese Prüfsumme an ihren Schlüssel an.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Augabe der CA ist es nun, nur das P&lt;sub&gt;Birgit&lt;/sub&gt; zu unterschreiben,
das wirklich zu Birgit gehört. In der Praxis funktionieren unterschiedliche
CAs sehr unterschiedlich gut. Dabei ist das System schon im wirtschaftlichen
Kern kaputt: Da die CA Geld von Birgit bekommt (und nicht von allen außer
Birgit), um P&lt;sub&gt;Birgit&lt;/sub&gt; zu unterschreiben, ist die Motivation der CA
hoch, Birgit &lt;em&gt;irgendetwas&lt;/em&gt; zu unterschreiben, damit sie das Geld von Birgit
bekommt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohne genaue Kenntnis des Prozesses, der durchlaufen werden muß, um
P&lt;sub&gt;Birgit&lt;/sub&gt; zu unterschreiben, ist das Zertifikat also wertlos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Und: Man beachte, daß die CA zum Unterschreiben von P&lt;sub&gt;Birgit&lt;/sub&gt; keine
Kenntnis von Q&lt;sub&gt;Birgit&lt;/sub&gt; haben muß, d.h. den geheimen Schlüssel von
Birgit muß die CA weder erzeugen noch muß Birgit ihn der CA aushändigen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Und: Eine CA ist ein großes und spannendes Ziel für einen Angreifer. Der
Q&lt;sub&gt;CA&lt;/sub&gt; muß wirklich gut bewacht werden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/kryptogrundlagen/img16.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Und noch ein paar weitere Beobachtungen: Birgit kann sich ihren Key mehrfach
von unterschiedlichen CAs zertifizieren lassen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Und Andreas braucht den Key der CA von Birgit nicht zu kennen. Er kann den
Key einer anderen CA kennen, die den Public Key der CA von Birgit kennt,
unter Umständen über x Schritte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beispiele für beides findet man jedoch eher in PGP als in X.509.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/kryptogrundlagen/img17.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Und schließlich noch das Implosionsproblem: Was passiert, wenn Andreas
seinen privaten Schlüssel verbummelt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn der Schlüssel eine Laufzeit hat, löst sich dieses Problem mit dem
Auflauf der Laufzeit des Schlüssels von selber. Gilt Andreas&amp;rsquo; Schlüssel etwa
noch ein Jahr, genügt es, das Problem ein Jahr lang zu ignorieren und dann
ist es weg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will man es nicht ignorieren, dann braucht man eine Rückziehliste der
&amp;lsquo;irrtümlich unterschriebenen oder jetzt auf Wunsch des Inhabers
zurückgezogenen Unterschriften&amp;rsquo;. Das ist eine Certificate Revokation List,
CRL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die URL der CRL einer CA sollte in jedem Zertifikat enthalten sein, und es
sollte theoretisch ein Protokoll (eine API) geben, mit der man das Prädikat
&amp;lsquo;gültig?&amp;rsquo; für ein gegebenes Zertifikat effizient prüfen kann, und mit der
man die gesamte CRL einer CA komplett für den Offline-Gebrauch runterladen
kann. In der Praxis funktioniert beides nicht sehr gut&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/kryptogrundlagen/img18.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ebenfalls nicht sehr gut funktioniert das Lesen und Schreiben von Standards,
besonders wenn es sich um ITU/CCITT-Normen handelt: Diese sind zu optional
oder zu vage für eine Implementierung oder einfach falsch definiert. Daher
gibt es eine Reihe von Dokumenten, die PKCS, die quasi Richtigstellungen und
Präzisierungen zu diesem Komplex unterhalten. Ohne sie ist der Standard
nicht umsetzbar.
&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/kryptogrundlagen/img19.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soweit die Technik.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jetzt will man das Ganze noch in eine Form gießen, die in Deutschland auch
juristisch anwendbar ist. Dazu muß man quasi das Gesetz mit der Technik
verkabeln. Diese Aufgabe haben die EU Signaturrichtlinie, das deutsche
Signaturgesetz und die Durchführungsverordnung dazu, sowie eine Reihe von
Gesetzen, die bestehende Gesetze so ändern, daß die alte Vokabel
&amp;ldquo;Unterschrift&amp;rdquo; zu einem Hook wird, der wahlweise eine traditionelle
Unterschrift oder eine digitale Signatur aufrufen kann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/kryptogrundlagen/img20.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dazu definiert das Signaturgesetz drei Dinge: Die &amp;ldquo;Einfache elektronische
Signatur&amp;rdquo;, die vollkommen nutzlos ist, die &amp;ldquo;fortgeschrittene elektronische
Signatur&amp;rdquo;, die man etwa mit PGP oder einer OpenSSL-CA selber generieren
kann, und die &amp;ldquo;Qualifizierte elektronische Signatur&amp;rdquo;, die eine solche CA
nach bestimmten technischen und organisatorischen Richtlinien betrieben und
zertifiziert verlangt.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Flames - Kommunikationszusammenbrüche im Netz</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2007/02/11/flames-kommunikationszusammenbrueche-im-netz.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 11 Feb 2007 13:31:15 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2007/02/11/flames-kommunikationszusammenbrueche-im-netz.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Vergangenen Donnerstag habe ich den Vortrag &amp;ldquo;Flames - Kommunikationszusammenbrüche im Netz&amp;rdquo; für den CCC Stuttgart gehalten.
Hier sind die Slides und ein
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXD3vk9M7SQ&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Youtube Video&lt;/a&gt;


von einer späteren Aufführung des Vortrages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2007/02/flames/img0.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Vortrag basiert auf den Kommunikationserfahrungen, die ich mit einigen Freunden im USENET in verschiedenen Foren gemacht habe.
Aber ich denke, daß die Erkenntnisse hier auf mehr als eine Weise auch auf andere Umgebungen übertragbar sind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;was-ist-eine-flame&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#was-ist-eine-flame&#34;&gt;
	Was ist eine Flame?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2007/02/flames/img1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was ist eine Flame?
Ein Beitrag in einer Online-Diskussion, der provozierend geschrieben ist.
Oder ein Beitrag, der auf eine Art und Weise ein unwichtiges oder formales Thema behandelt, sodass der Leser sich darüber aufregt und in Zorn gerät.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;warum&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#warum&#34;&gt;
	Warum?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2007/02/flames/img2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warum schreiben Leute Flames?
Wenn man fragt, bekommt man Antworten von der Art&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Das kann man doch so nicht stehen lassen!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Der soll sich doch erst mal benehmen lernen!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;und als Nummer 1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Jetzt fühle ich mich besser!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dafür ist die Diskussion in Folge gestört und nicht konstruktiv, aber ist dann nicht das Problem des Flamers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;warum-im-netz&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#warum-im-netz&#34;&gt;
	Warum im Netz?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2007/02/flames/img3.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das passiert in der Regel im Netz und nicht in der realen Welt.
Wenn man sich mit Leuten, die für ihr Verhalten im Netz bekannt oder berüchtigt sind unterhält, bei einem Bier abends im Garten, dann sind das meist relativ intelligente und ziemlich nette Leute.
Aber halt nur, wenn man denen gegenüber sitzt und nicht, wenn man mit denen über Netz kommuniziert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;kommunikationsmodell&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#kommunikationsmodell&#34;&gt;
	Kommunikationsmodell
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2007/02/flames/img4.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn man verstehen will, was dort passiert, dann muss man sich ein wenig mit Kommunikationswissenschaft und Umständen beschäftigen.
Das Modell von Schulz von Thum und den vier Ebenen der Kommunikation ist dabei hilfreich:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sachinformation: Worüber ich informiere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selbstoffenbarung: Was ich von mir selbst kundgebe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beziehung: Wie wir beide zueinander stehen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appell: Wozu ich Dich veranlassen will.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jede Kommunikation ist am Ende immer eine Störung.
Der Empfänger einer Nachricht sitzt da so und geht friedlich seinen eigenen Sachen nach, aber wenn ich mit diesem Menschen kommuniziere, dann will ich etwas von dem.
Ich möchte, daß er seine aktuelle Tätigkeit unterbricht und etwas anderes tut.
Das ist dann der Appell in der Nachricht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;kommunikationsmodell-ii&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#kommunikationsmodell-ii&#34;&gt;
	Kommunikationsmodell II
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2007/02/flames/img5.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Man kann nicht nicht kommunizieren&amp;rdquo;, Paul Watzlawick, 1969&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Every behaviour is a kind of communication. Because behaviour does not have a counterpart (there is no anti-behaviour), it is not possible not to communicate.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kommunikation ist Verhalten und es gibt kein Nicht-Verhalten.
Das bedeutet, jede Aktivität, selbst eine Flame, ist eigentlich eine Form von Kommunikation.
Die besonderen Umstände der Kommunikation im Netz machen es notwendig, daß man die erlernten Verhaltensmuster aus der realen Welt mal kurzschließt und sein Verhalten umstellt, damit man mit Flames korrekt umgehen kann.
Das muss man sich aber bewusst antrainieren.
Wenn man da seinen Instinkten und normalen Verhaltensweisen folgt, dann geht es schief, denn die normalen Offline-Verhaltensmuster sind online wirkungslos und deswegen falsch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;kommunikationsmodell-iii&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#kommunikationsmodell-iii&#34;&gt;
	Kommunikationsmodell III
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2007/02/flames/img6.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Außerhalb des Netzes habe ich ganz viele Kommunikationskanäle.
Den gesprochenen Text des Vortrages kann ich aufschreiben, aber das ist nicht dasselbe, denn das ist nicht, was hier passiert.
Denn gleichzeitig haben die Anwesenden im Vortrag die Optik, hören die Stimme und Betonung und wie sich der Vortragende sich bewegt und mimt.
Inkongruente Kommunikation, Ironie und Sarkasmus, sind leicht zu erkennen und - durch den Rückkanal - wenn sie nicht funktionieren leicht zu korrigieren und korrekt zu kontextualisieren.
Jede Aussage in einer Anwesenheitssituation wird so noch einmal mehrfach qualifiziert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In einer Onlinesituation ist das meiste davon nicht vorhanden.
Alles, was noch da ist, ist der Text.
Damit fehlen viele soziale Kommunikationshilfen, die der Empfänger gewohnt ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dazu kommt, daß ich über die Grenzen von Zeit und Raum kommuniziere:
Meine Kommunikation wird unter Umständen zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt von einer mir unbekannten Person in einem unbekannten Kontext gelesen und interpretiert.
Der Kontext wird dadurch sehr viel offener für Interpretation, weil Leser und Schreiber ganz andere Erwartungen haben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Im Netz kommt noch dazu, daß viele Leute im Netz zwar ein schriftliches Medium benutzen, aber Formulierungen, Ansprache und Kontext wie in einer gesprochenen Kommunikation setzen.
Der so entstehende Text hat also alle die persistenten Eigenschaften von einem Buch, einem Artikel oder sonst einem geschriebenen Text:
Ich kenne als Autor den Empfänger nicht, ich habe den zeitlichen Versatz darin, ich habe den sozialen Kontext nicht und unter Umständen kenne ich den größeren Kontext des Empfängers nicht.
Auf der anderen Seite haben wir aber all die offenen, vieldeutigen Formulierungen und Interpretationsmöglichkeiten des gesprochenen Wortes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein Leser, der mein aufgeschriebenes gesprochenes Wort viele Monate oder Jahre später liest, und dabei ganz anders kontextualisiert, wird das oft ganz anders interpretieren als es gemeint und originär verstanden worden ist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dazu kommt natürlich das Aufeinandertreffen von zwei Personengruppen:
Wir haben Dauerteilnehmer, die schon lange dabei sind und eine ganze Menge Kontext, Kenntnisse und lokale Subkultur haben.
Aber zugleich haben wir auch Laufkundschaft, die in dem Forum mit einem konkreten Ziel oder einer Frage aufschlägt, eine Antwort haben möchte und dann wieder verschwindet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die meisten Online-Communities sind auf diese Situation schlecht eingerichtet.
Das heißt, Neuankömmlinge werden oft schlecht integriert, weil eventuell gar kein Mechanismus existiert, um Laufkundschaft abzufertigen oder Historie und Subkultur zu lehren.
Dadurch sind die Regulars schnell genervt, weil sie sich vorkommen als seien sie die Hauptperson in einem dieser Filme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In der realen Welt erwarten wir von Personen, daß sie sich in einer bestimmten Situation dem sozialen Kontext entsprechend verhalten.
Es gibt entsprechend in allen diesen Systemen Methoden zur Erzwingung von Konformität.
In der realen Welt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Konformes Verhalten wird belohnt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nicht konformes Verhalten wird bestraft (&amp;ldquo;Schlag auf&amp;rsquo;s Maul.&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das geht im Netz so nicht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The social dynamics of the net are a direct consequence of the fact that nobody has yet developed a Remote Strangulation Protocol&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Larry Wall&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das Zitat erklärt, daß im Netz die negativen Mechanismen zur Erzwingung von Konformität nicht funktionieren.
Man kann niemanden remote Erwürgen, ihm nicht remote auf&amp;rsquo;s Maul hauen, aber auch nicht dauerhaft aus der Diskussion aussperren.
Keiner der negativen Steuermechanismen, die wir gewohnt sind, funktioniert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man kann Flames als fehlgeleitetes, unwirksames negatives Verhaltensfeedback interpretieren:
Weil wir aus der realen Welt gewohnt sind, nicht konformen Personen negatives Feedback zu geben, versuchen wir das auch Online.
Da ist es wirkungslos, und daher für die Kommunikation destruktiv, denn es schadet der Diskussion des Flamers und der laufenden Diskussion mit seinen Freunden mehr als der Person, die geflamed wird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nur die positiven Instrumente sind wirksam, mit denen wir konformes Verhalten belohnen können.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kommunikation im Netz in Foren ist öffentlich:
Es reden nicht nur der Flamer und der Geflamte miteinander, sondern es lesen auch immer noch weitere Personen mit.
Die Flame ist also immer auch eine Inszenierung gegenüber den Peers, und gegenüber Dritten (&amp;ldquo;Innocent Bystanders&amp;rdquo;) und prägt so Verhaltensnormen und Umgangsformen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daraus ergibt sich die Frage für den Umgang mit Trollen und Flames:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was ist effektiv,
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wenn &lt;strong&gt;alle&lt;/strong&gt; Repressionsmechanismen fehlen?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was kann ich tun, wenn ich mich ausschließlich auf positive Feedbackmechanismen beim Erziehen von Leuten verlassen muss?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir reden im Grunde über Krieg.
Ich möchte eigentlich mit Gewalt - ohne daß ich Gewalt ausüben kann, weil mir die Mittel dazu fehlen - etwas bewirken:
Bei meinem Gegenüber eine Verhaltensänderung erzwingen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man muss sich also als Erstes überlegen, was das Kriegsziel - hier das Kommunikationsziel - ist, das man erreichen möchte.
Eine Siegbedingung festlegen, auf die man hin arbeiten kann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eigentlich möchte ich, daß sich diese Leute so verhalten, wie es für dieses Forum angemessen ist.
Dafür muss ich das erst einmal definieren.
Wenn ich also eine bestimmte Kultur etablieren möchte, dann muss ich die erst einmal definieren und aufschreiben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist schwierig, wenn man in einer Murmeltiertags-Situation ist und gar keine Kultur hat, weil man sich nicht erinnern kann.
Ich brauche also überhaupt erst einmal einen Mechanismus, der Erinnerung institutionalisiert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir haben keine negativen Feedback-Mechanismen.
Wir können nicht Strafen, wir haben keine Möglichkeiten, Leute rauszuwerfen, ihre Kommunikation zu unterdrücken oder herauszufiltern.
Ich kann zwar filtern, was bei mir hereinkommt, aber ich  kann meinen Filter nicht anderen überstülpen, und damit kann ich mit meinem Filer nicht andere für alle herausdrängen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weil ich keine Repressionsmechanismen habe, brauche ich auch nicht zu drohen.
Jede Drohung ist, weil sie nicht durchsetzbar ist, ein Bluff.
Angstbasierte Kommunikation ist damit unglaubwürdig und wirkungslos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am 1. Januar 2000 wurde die Gruppe &amp;ldquo;de.comp.lang.php&amp;rdquo; eingerichtet.
Die Gruppe wurde in relativ kurzer Zeit sehr populär.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dort hat sehr viel Drive-By Kommunikation stattgefunden, die man heute eher auf Stack Exchange finden würde:
Leute tauchen auf, stellen eine technische Frage, wollen eine Antwort und sind dann wieder weg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dabei wiederholen sich natürlich viele Fragen.
Das nervt viele Leute, und sie nehmen sich dann auch nicht die Zeit, korrekte oder gute Antworten zu formulieren.
Durch die Wiederholungen wird die Stimmung schlecht, und bald gibt es statt sinnvoller Antworten nur noch Beschimpfungen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wir wollen ein Erinnerungsvermögen haben!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wir wollen bestimmte Standards etablieren, hinsichtlich Ton und Qualität der Antworten.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neulinge sollen sinnvolle, richtige Antworten und Anleitung in einem freundlichen Ton bekommen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wir können nur positive Feedbackmechanismen verwenden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;experiment-dclp-ii&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#experiment-dclp-ii&#34;&gt;

&lt;/h1&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2007/02/flames/img15.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist machbar, denn die Gruppe ist neu.
Es gibt noch keine Standards, also kann ich Regeln nach Wunsch etablieren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es ist eine technische Gruppe:
Es gibt eine objektive Wahrheit, und als technischer Schreiber kann ich den Diskurs bereichern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist eine gute Ausgangsbasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schritt 1: Erinnerungsvermögen herstellen - eine FAQ!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schritt 2: Respekt basierende Kommunikation als Norm durch Vorführen etablieren.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ich schreibe Antworten.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Die Antworten sind getestet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sie beantworten Fragen, die oft gefragt werden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Das generiert Karma - öffentliches Ansehen. &amp;ldquo;Kris löst Probleme und gewinnt so Ansehen bei Fragestellern.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Ich will auch Karma.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Ich mache Kris Verhalten nach.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn dann Trolle auftauchen und die deswegen trollen, weil sie Aufmerksamkeit wollen, dann sehen sie:
So, mit Beleidigungen, kommen sie nicht weiter, sondern werden ignoriert.
In dieser Gruppe bekommen man Aufmerksamkeit und Ansehen, Meinungsführerschaft, durch Mitarbeit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das Projekt ist im Grunde das Ergebnis einer Provokation:
In der deutschen Linux-Gruppe hat eine Person mit Technik- und Soziologie-Hintergrund geschrieben, die richtig gute und technisch vollständige Antworten geschrieben hat.
Diese waren aber so gestaltet, daß der Leser sich beim Lesen aufgeregt hat und dadurch nicht mehr in der Lage war, die Antwort zu verstehen und sinnvoll zu nutzen.
Das waren brillante textliche Werke, die auf eine einzigartige Weise Leute manipuliert haben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leider hat das Nachahmer animiert, ebenso zu handeln - ohne zu verstehen, was den Originalautor ausgezeichnet hat und was seine Texte besonders gemacht hat.
Dadurch wurde die Gruppe schnell zu einem Sumpf voller Beschimpfungen und die Gruppe wurde nutzlos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der betreffende Autor war außerdem der Auffassung, man könne Laufkundschaft anders nicht in den Griff bekommen.
Das Experiment dclp war ein Versuch, diesem Menschen das Gegenteil zu beweisen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;experiment-dclp-iv&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#experiment-dclp-iv&#34;&gt;

&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trennung Kultur/Technische Anleitung&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dauer: ca. 2 Jahre + 2 Jahre passiv&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die FAQ hat für jede Frage eine URL generiert.
Es gab also einen Artikel pro Seite: Antwort, Material, Querverweise, getestetes Beispiel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bei der Arbeit mit der FAQ habe ich mir dann grundsätzlich Fragen gesucht, die falsch oder gar nicht beantwortet worden sind.
Fragen, die bereits bearbeitet waren, brauchten meine Aufmerksamkeit ja nicht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die generierten Antworten von mir sind in der Regel in weniger als 60 Sekunden verfasst gewesen und bestanden aus 3 Teilen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bridge: Gleich kommt die Antwort und sie steht mit Deiner Frage folgendermaßen in Verbindung.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Antworten: Die URL auf die Antwort. Nicht die URL auf die FAQ, sondern die URL der spezifischen Antwort. Es geht darum, eine Person mit einem konkreten Problem arbeitsfähig zu machen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nachtreten: Das so erworbene Karma verbrauchen. Also, erklären, was richtig oder falsch an der Art der Fragestellung war, und wie man sich hier besser verhalten kann, um bessere Antworten zu bekommen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist auch eine Inszenierung.
Das heißt, ich schreibe jeden Artikel immer auch für unbeteiligte Mitleser.
Diese lernen dadurch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Man kann die Probleme von Fragestellern lösen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Man kann die Probleme mit den Fragestellern beeinflussen, also ihr Verhalten verbessern.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Man macht das, indem man sich so verhält wie Kris.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diese Vorgehensweise war auch in der FAQ im Kapitel 0 dokumentiert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;experiment-dclp-v&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#experiment-dclp-v&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Langes Nachklappern&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaum Flames&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Einige der besten FAQ-Autoren!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das Nehmen von Fragen und ihre Umwandlung in FAQ-Artikel ist ein Kondensationsprozess, bei dem man die Ergebnisse einer interaktiven Kommunikation vom Kontext befreit, verallgemeinert und in einen Artikel umwandelt.
Mehrere Artikel zu einem Thema ergeben ein Kapitel, aber die Artikel sind nicht miteinander verknüpft.
Sie stehen nur thematisch und von den URLs nebeneinander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein weitere Kondensationsprozess könnte die Artikel der FAQ nehmen, und in Kapitel eines Buches zum Thema umwandeln.
Das hat meines Wissens nur mit comp.lang.c funktioniert: Die FAQ dieser Gruppe ist von Peter van der Linden in das Buch &amp;ldquo;Deep C Secrets&amp;rdquo; umgewandelt worden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &amp;ldquo;de.rec.spiele.rpg.misc&amp;rdquo; ein ähnliches Projekt von Azundris.
Kein Hard Science Thema, keine objektive Wahrheit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man will also Erinnerung schaffen und Erkenntnisse aus vorherigen Diskussionen aufbewahren.
Dabei muss man berücksichtigen, daß es viele Regulars und wenig Laufkundschaft gibt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;experiment-drsrm-ii&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#experiment-drsrm-ii&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die FAQ ist also mehr ein Protokoll vergangener Diskussionen und Positionen.
Dabei wird das Protokoll, wo machbar, in Wikipedia-Stil verfasst, also &amp;ldquo;Neutral Point of View&amp;rdquo; eingenommen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An den Stellen wo das nicht ging, weil unvereinbar kontroverse Positionen vertreten wurden, sind diese im Stil von Everything2 nebeneinander gestellt worden.
Dabei werden die kontroversen Punkte herausgearbeitet, damit auch klar wird, worin der Konflikt besteht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;experiment-drsrm-iii&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#experiment-drsrm-iii&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das führt zum Abschluss von Themen:
Das Protokoll sichert bereits abgedecktes Terrain bei Diskussionen und spätere Diskussionen können sich an die Ergebnisse früherer Instanz den der Diskussion erinnern.
Das macht wiederaufflammen bereits abgearbeiteter Themen schwierig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist nicht unbedingt günstig für eine Gruppe, die sowieso schon Low Traffic war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dennoch gutes Beispiel für nicht-technische Gruppen und was man dort mit einer FAQ erreichen kann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;experiment-dtb&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#experiment-dtb&#34;&gt;
	Experiment dtb
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2007/02/flames/img22.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dtb ist Klamauk, Satire, Wirr, eine Spaßgruppe.
Ein Testbed für Experimental-Kommunikation beschreibt es recht gut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dort haben sich Leute zusammen gefunden mit einer eigenartigen Idee von Humor und gewissen sprachlichen Fertigkeiten.
Eine Tradition, die sich relativ schnell herausgebildet hat, sind &amp;ldquo;Out of Area&amp;rdquo;-Einsätze.
Die Regulars von dtb sind dabei losgegangen und haben ihre Art zu kommunizieren einmal in andere Gruppen transplantiert um zu sehen, was daraus wird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein klassisches Beispiel war &amp;ldquo;de.alt.ufo&amp;rdquo;, in dem dtb-Regulars versucht haben, in de.alt.ufo die Verschwörungstheoretiker mit neuen Verschwörungsideen zu übertreffen.
Das war eine interessante Erfahrung, weil das komplett fehlgeschlagen ist:
Wenn die dtb-Leute in einer Verschwörungstheorie-Gruppe mit einer offensichtlich ausgedachten, verabredeten und unsinnigen Idee auftauchen, dann kommen die de.alt.ufo-Leute, nehmen das und bauen das in ihre Erzählungen einfach ein.
Alles wird assimiliert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn man dasselbe in de.admin.news, der Netzverwaltung macht, dann sitzen dort die ganzen Nomic-Spieler und die sind nicht in der Lage, dtb zu verarbeiten und stürzen ab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wahrheitsfindung-ohne-wahrheitsnennung&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#wahrheitsfindung-ohne-wahrheitsnennung&#34;&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Wahrheitsfindung ohne Wahrheitsnennung&amp;rdquo;:
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es ist in dtb gelungen, einen Gruppenkonsens herzustellen, ohne diesen zu verbalisieren.
Es begann damit, daß Personen in dtb eintrafen und versucht haben, mit einer Organisation zu reden, also jemanden zu sprechen, der verantwortlich war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ähnliches war zuvor in den kiel.* Netzwerkgruppen passiert, wo jemand aus dem Fido-Netz den Netzwerkkoordinator für kiel.* sprechen wollte.
Es war einfacher, sich als die betreffende Person zu kennzeichnen als dem Gegenüber zu erklären, daß es solche Strukturen für kiel.* nicht gibt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So auch in dtb, wo ich Anordnungen erlassen habe und diese mit &amp;ldquo;Fünfter und Sprecher des Hohen Rathes der 13 Weisen vom Feed&amp;rdquo; gezeichnet habe.
Das ist eine offensichtlich unsinnige Organisation und ich habe mir auch nicht die Führungsposition gegeben und irgendein Neben-Amt, das den Anschein von Autorität vermittelt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wirkungsweise und Zweck dieser Anmaßung und der Konstruktion dahinter sind von den Regulars dieser Gruppe sofort verstanden worden, und sie haben es aufgegriffen.
Dabei sind ohne weitere Absprache weitere Ämter (aber kein Herrscher) und Positionen (aber keine der ersten Drei) belegt worden.
Es ist also eine Nicht-Organisation formiert worden, ohne sich abzusprechen und diese war im wahrsten Wortsinne kopflos:
Organisierte, strukturierte Anarchie!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;experiment-dtb-ii&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#experiment-dtb-ii&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diese Nicht-Organisation ist dann gegenüber de.news.admin mit Forderungen aufgetreten, und hat so Chaos gestiftet:
dtb hat das Usenet als Kommunikationsmedium an seine Grenzen gebracht&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Deutscher Rekordhalter im Fremdcancel&amp;rdquo;: Alle Artikel, dazu auch alle Crosspostings in dtb, durch Fremdcancel gelöscht.
Drei Tage die Gruppe durch den Cancelbot leer gehalten.
Das hat auch alle Crosspostings gelöscht.
Alle Artikel nach drei Tagen wiederhergestellt, aber mit geändertem Betreff - &amp;ldquo;ONLY THREAD EVER&amp;rdquo; - und mit geänderten Referenzen, sodaß ein gigantischer verketteter Megathread entstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dabei sind auch die Crosspostings wiederhergestellt worden, und haben so die anderen, nicht-dtb Gruppen getroffen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Reaktion in de.admin.news war der Antrag, dtb zu löschen, weil die Insassen dort komplett unkontrollierbar seien.
Die dtb-Mannschaft und der Hohe Rath haben dem vom Herzen zugestimmt: &amp;ldquo;Ja, wir waren böse und müssen bestraft werden.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daraufhin hat de.admin.news sich gewundert, warum die dtb-Leute das wollen, und die Löschung verhindert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#summary&#34;&gt;
	Summary
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was ist das Kriegsziel, welchen Zustand möchte ich erreichen?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was ist das Publikum und wie reagieren die?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was sind die Mittel, die ich habe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beispiel: Heise-Forum steuern. Ansatz mit &amp;ldquo;Carpet-Bombing&amp;rdquo;:
Unter faktenfreie Artikel im Heise-Forum Antworten mit sinnvollem Inhalt setzen, und dadurch in allen Threads, die aus dem Ruder laufen, die Diskussion wieder in sinnvolle Bereiche bringen.
Nach 15-20 Minuten meistens Lufthoheit in dem betreffenden Forum erreicht.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Vorträge halten</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2005/05/30/vortraege-richtig-halten.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 May 2005 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2005/05/30/vortraege-richtig-halten.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Der folgende Vortrag stammt einem &amp;ldquo;Dienstags-Vortrag&amp;rdquo; in Karlsruhe-Durlach.
Ich versuche zu erklären, wie man Vorträge plant und hält.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/vortragen/img0.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vorträge hält man für eine bestimmte Zielgruppe, die man kennen und beschreiben können muß.
Das heisst, man muss wissen, wofür diese Leute sich interessieren, warum sie im Vortrag sitzen werden und was ihr Kontext und ihr Vorwissen ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein Vortrag hat ein Ziel, wir wollen den Rahmen im Kopf der Zielgruppe ändern, also etwas erreichen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dazu müssen wir unsere Kommunikation kontrollieren und an diesem Ziel ausrichten. Dazu stehen uns die Folien, die Sprache und unser Auftreten als Referent/in zur Verfügung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Und die Form muß stimmen, damit wir ernst genommen werden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ziel-und-zielgruppe&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#ziel-und-zielgruppe&#34;&gt;
	Ziel und Zielgruppe
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/vortragen/img1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Leute im Vortrag geben Dir ihr wertvollstes Gut um Dir zuzuhören: Ihre Lebenszeit.
Du hast ein konkretes Ziel: Du willst in ihren Köpfen was verändern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohne genau zu formulieren, was das ist und wo diese Leute jetzt, vorher stehen, kann das nichts werden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das bedeutet: Der Vortrag muß vorbereitet sein und hinterher auch so wirken.
Denn sonst fühlen sich Deine Zuhörerinnen veralbert und nicht ernst genommen und sind nicht bereit, Deiner Argumentation zu folgen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was genau ist also das Ziel des Vortrages?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Willst Du etwas vermitteln (Neue Fertigkeiten)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Willst Du zu etwas aufrufen (Appell zur Handlung)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Willst Du Mittel einwerben (Aufruf zur Bereitstellung von Ressourcen)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Willst Du etwas verkaufen?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angenommen, alles läuft wie am Schnürchen: Wie soll das Ergebnis aussehen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zielgruppe&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#zielgruppe&#34;&gt;
	Zielgruppe
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/vortragen/img2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wer sind Deine Zuhörer, wie denken sie? Was ist ihnen wichtig? Welchen Argumentationslinien sind sie zugänglich?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wo willst Du sie hin bringen und ist das realistisch?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was ist eine gute Geschwindigkeit? Beachte auch den Kontext, die Uhrzeit und was vorher passiert ist oder nachher passieren wird.
Der erste oder letzte Vortrag einer Konferenz ist immer besonders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wie lange kannst Du das Durchhalten?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;agenda&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#agenda&#34;&gt;
	Agenda
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/vortragen/img3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeder Vortrag hat eine Agenda, einen argumentativen Ablauf.
Man kann und soll dabei transparent sein, und diese Agenda vorher oder während der Vortrages mit einem Highlight anzeigen.
Dadurch wissen Deine Zuhörer, wo wir sind, wie wir da hin gekommen sind und was noch kommt.
Sie können ihr eigenes Engagement besser planen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Für wen ist der Vortrag, und was muß der Zuhörer an Vorwissen oder Motivation mitbringen, um folgen zu können?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wie ist der Vortrag aufgebaut? Es ist sinnvoll, die Grobgliederung in Stichworten zu visualisieren oder einen Prozessbalken oder x/y Anzeiger mitzuführen.
Manche Themen lassen sich auch mehrdimensional (&amp;ldquo;als Landkarte&amp;rdquo;) darstellen und sind dann interessanter dargestellt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;kommunikation-kontrollieren&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#kommunikation-kontrollieren&#34;&gt;
	Kommunikation kontrollieren
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/vortragen/img4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alles im Vortrag hat sich dem Kommunikationsziel unterzuordnen.
Es mag noch andere Themen oder wissenswerte Dinge geben, aber diese haben keinen Platz.
Der Vortrag ist auch so lang genug.
Du kannst weiterführende Hinweise in der Nachbereitung oder den Fußnoten unterbringen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nur zielführende und wesentlicher Folien haben einen Platz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es ist gut, Reservefolien oder weitergehende Erklärungen zu haben.
Diese versteckt man in der Regel und zeigt sie nicht.
Nur wenn Fragen aufkommen, kann man - wenn es die Zeit erlaubt - in diese Richtung vertiefen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeder Vortrag ist individuell.
Betrachte die Situation und das Publikum, dann ordne die Folien, verstecke unwesentliche Folien, passe Folien an.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;die-magische-zahl&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#die-magische-zahl&#34;&gt;
	Die magische Zahl
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/vortragen/img5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sieben&lt;/strong&gt; (plus oder minus Zwei)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Menschen können circa sieben Dinge mit einem Blick erfassen.
Auf eine Folie gehören wenige, interessante Dinge.
Niemals mehr als Sieben, eher weniger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Du brauchst die Folien nicht vorzulesen und sie müssen nicht dem gesprochenen Wort entsprechen.
Du brauchst sie auch nicht als Gedächnisstütze.
Sie dienen nur der Kontextualisierung des Vortrags und des gesprochenen Wortes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;niveau&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#niveau&#34;&gt;
	Niveau
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/vortragen/img6.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beim Schreiben gilt: Schreibe für ein Publikum von Achtjährigen. Verwende Hauptsätze, mache keine inhaltlichen Sprünge, setze kein Wissen über die Welt voraus.
Deine Leser sind nicht dumm, aber sie haben keine Zeit, kein Vorwissen über Dein Thema und sind abgelenkt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn Du in einer Fachzeitschrift schreibst, ziele auf Zwölfjährige. Du kannst komplexere Sätze bauen, aber Du musst noch immer alle Schritte und allen Kontext transportieren.
Auch hier gilt, dass die Leser nicht in Deinem Fachgebiet arbeiten und nicht Dein Vorwissen haben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beim gesprochenen Vortrag gilt ähnliches:
Deine Worte müssen den Zuhörer auf eine Reise mitnehmen und jeden Schritt machen, jeden Kontext herstellen.
Nur dann können und wollen sie folgen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bilder&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#bilder&#34;&gt;
	Bilder
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/vortragen/img7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bilder sind gut. Dieser Vortrag hat zu wenige davon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bilder sind groß, aussagekräftig, bunt und haben keine feinen Linien oder subtilen Farbkontraste.
Sie verdeutlichen Dinge meistens besser als viele Worte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manche Begriffe lassen sich jedoch wegen Abstraktion nicht gut visualisieren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sprache&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#sprache&#34;&gt;
	Sprache
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/vortragen/img8.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deine Zuhörerinnen können lesen und tun das auch.
Du brauchst ihnen die Folien nicht vorzulesen.
Sie sind auch kein Ersatz für den Aufschrieb oder einen geschlossenen Text, der das Thema noch vertieft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Vortrag liefert also Anekdoten und Bilder, die das Thema erinnerbar machen.
Sie gehen den Rahmen und die Erzählung vor, und setzen damit den Kontext, indem die anderweitig bereitgestellten Fakten rezipiert, erinnert und verarbeitet werden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;publikum&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#publikum&#34;&gt;
	Publikum
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/vortragen/img9.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halte den Rapport zum Publikum. Suche Dir einige Personen an verschiedenen Orten im Raum, und wenn Du den Blick durch den Raum schweifen läßt, schaue immer wieder zu diesen Personen.
Dadurch fühlen sich alle in der Nähe angesprochen, und Du hast Messpunkte, an denen Du sehen kannst, ob Du die Aufmerksamkeit im Raum halten kannst.
Das sollte auch Dein Tempo bestimmen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprich Hochdeutsch und plappere nicht! Du willst vortragen, und das heisst eine flüssige, eingeübte sprachlich und argumentativ zusammenhängende Rede.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wer sind die Extrempersonen im Raum?
Fans, Skeptiker, Entscheider, Influencer?
Es kann sinnvoll sein, schon während der Vortrags vorher im Raum zu sein, wenn das Publikum bleibt, oder vor dem Vortrag rechtzeitig da zu sein und Personen zu identifizieren und zu klassifizieren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wähle diese Personen um den Raum zu lesen.
Stimmt das Tempo?
Stimmt der Spannungsbogen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;noch-mehr-publikum&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#noch-mehr-publikum&#34;&gt;
	Noch mehr Publikum
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/vortragen/img10.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tempo 120%.
Auf diese Weise sind alle gezwungen, mit Aufmerksamkeit bei Dir zu bleiben und nicht wegen Langeweile abzuschweifen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bei einer Gruppe von Schulklassengröße kannst Du eine Person durch zu hohes Tempo verlieren, aber nicht zwei.
Bist Du zu langsam, verlierst Du sehr schnell alle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;form&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#form&#34;&gt;
	Form
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/vortragen/img11.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was ist Dein Auftritt?
Ist es ein Vortrag (Du redest und stehst vor den anderen)?
Ein Workshop (Du stehst vor den anderen und beantwortest Zuhörerinnenfragen)?
Ist es eine moderierte Dikussion (Du und eventuell andere Reden abwechselnd, in Rede und Gegenrede)?
Eine Rede (Also nicht erklärend wie ein Vortrag, sondern appelativ und emotional)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arbeite die Unterschiede dieser Formen heraus und wähle die für den Anlaß und das Ziel richtige.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zeit&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#zeit&#34;&gt;
	Zeit
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/vortragen/img12.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wie lang?
10-20 Minuten sind ein guter Block für einen thematisch zusammenhängenden Block.
In der Schule wäre nach so einem Abschnitt &amp;ldquo;Methodenwechsel&amp;rdquo; oder themenwechsel zum nächsten Abschnitt, oder beides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;45 Minuten sind eine Schulstunde und brauchen 2-3 klar trennbare Abschnitte, und eine führende, sichtbare und wiederkehrende Navigationsstruktur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;90 Minuten sind sehr lang, ein Universtätsvortrag, und brauchen die Stukturierungen und Methodenwechsel von oben, und Tempowechsel, die den Zuhörerinnen erlauben, die Konzentration auch mal ruhen zu lassen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wann ist der Vortrag?
Randzeiten haben direkten Einfluß auf die Form.
Der erste Vortrag eines Tages darf freier und lockerer sein, überblick statt Tiefe geben und kann Stimmung und Thema setzen.
Er darf auch kontrovers sein, und eine Gegenthese zum Rest des Tages aufstellen, wenn sich das anbietet.
Der letzte Vortrag eines Tages ist oft lustiger, weil er als Rausschmeißer das Letzte zwischen der Veranstaltung und dem gemeinsamen Essen und Trinken ist.
Er fasst den Tag oder das Thema oft mit Humor zusammen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;murphy&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#murphy&#34;&gt;
	Murphy
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/vortragen/img13.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rechne damit, dass alles zusammenbricht.
Kannst Du Deinen Vortrag mit einer Wandtafel und einem Stück Kreide durchziehen? Mit einem Whiteboard und drei Filzstiften?
Das ist Dein Notprogramm, wenn wirklich alle Stricke reissen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was für Technik erwartet Doch? Ist die getestet? Hast Du alle denkbaren Adapter, Notstrom?
Was ist Dein Plan B, C und D? Hast Du den Vortrag nicht nur auf Deinem Computer und an den Veranstalter gemailed, sondern auch auf einem USB-Stick &amp;ldquo;selbstabspielend&amp;rdquo; dabei?
Was ist, wenn das Netz weg ist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiegelcheck vor dem Betreten der Bühne. Haare, Zähne, Kleidung, Hosenstall, Schuhe?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Security Management - was ist das eigentlich?</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2005/05/29/security-management.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 May 2005 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2005/05/29/security-management.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Der folgende Vortrag stammt einem &amp;ldquo;Dienstags-Vortrag&amp;rdquo; in Karlsruhe-Durlach, und versucht zu erklären, was der Kontext für ein Information Security Management System (ISMS) ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/security-management/img0.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Vortrag will erklären, was &amp;ldquo;Security Management&amp;rdquo; ist und erreichen will, was die Aufgaben des Security Managementprozesses sind (also was Security, Management und Prozeß sind), welche Schnittstellen der Prozeß hat und wie man eventuell versuchen kann, Security zu messen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;risk-and-compliance&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#risk-and-compliance&#34;&gt;
	Risk and Compliance
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/security-management/img1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klar ist, daß Security kein unmittelbares Geschäftsziel ist: Der Erfolg einer Firma mißt sich nicht an ihrer Performance im Bereich &amp;ldquo;Security&amp;rdquo;.
Stattdessen ist Security aber ein Non-Functional Requirement, das auf mehr als einem Weg in die Firma hineingetragen wird.
Das heißt, eine Reihe von externen Einflüssen wirken auf die Firma ein und machen es erforderlich auf mehr als eine Weise sich mit Security zu beschäftigen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gesetze und Behörden setzen Mindestmaßstäbe fest, gesetzliche Auflagen und Fürsorge für die Mitarbeiter bestimmen das Vorgehen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wirtschaftsprüfer und externe Verträge (&amp;ldquo;PCI Standards&amp;rdquo; aus Verträgen mit Kreditkartenfirmen, oder Cyberversicherungen) schreiben eine Bearbeitung des Themas vor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Usus&amp;rdquo; oder &amp;ldquo;Stand der Technik&amp;rdquo; ist an mehr als einer Stelle im Datenschutzrecht und in anderen Gesetzen verankert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aus dem Markt und durch Expertenmeinungen wird die Entscheidungsfindung beeinflusst.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schlechte Presse wegen schlechter Sicherheit führt zur Gefährdung des Geschäftsbetriebes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/security-management/img2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allgemeiner gesprochen geht es um Risiken und ihre Absicherung.
Interne Risiken sind &amp;ldquo;die Sicherung der Verfügbarkeit, Integrität und Vertrauchlichkeit von geschäftskritischer Infrastruktur&amp;rdquo; und die &amp;ldquo;Sicherstellung der Nachhaltigkeit des Geschäftsbetriebes&amp;rdquo;.
Das ist das Äquivalent einer Firma zu dem persönlichen Wunsch, nicht sterben zu wollen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Externe Risiken sind &amp;ldquo;die Erfüllung von gesetzlichen und vertraglichen Regelungen&amp;rdquo;, als da sind KontraG, BGB, AktG, HGB, DSG, &amp;hellip; sowie Verpflichtungen aus Verträgen mit Partnern und Versicherungen.
Dieser Teil wird meist unter der Überschrift &amp;ldquo;Compliance&amp;rdquo; abgehandelt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erstaunlicherweise gehen viele Firmen sehr locker mit dem Todeswunsch (also tatsächlicher Security) um, und nehmen Compliance ernster als tatsächliche Security, die sich mit realen und unmittelbaren Bedrohungen beschäftigt.
Das hat allerdings auch damit zu tun, daß dieses Thema leichter zu greifen und zu quantifizieren ist.
&amp;ldquo;Wir suchen da, wo Licht ist, nicht da, wo wir was finden könnten.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;risiken-und-maßnahmen-ssh-host-keys&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#risiken-und-ma%c3%9fnahmen-ssh-host-keys&#34;&gt;
	Risiken und Maßnahmen: ssh Host Keys
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/security-management/img3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Als Security Fuzzi bei web.de bekomme ich von Freunden und Mitarbeitern oft die Frage (oder den Vorschlag) im Umgang mit ssh eine Liste von Fingerprints von Host-Keys von Maschinen bereit zu stellen.
Wenn ich mich dann auf Host x einlogge, wird mir der Fingerprint der Maschine angezeigt und ich kann den mit der Liste vergleichen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Frage ist also:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sollten wir nicht eine Liste der Fingerprints aller Maschinen pflegen und den Admins an die Hand geben?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was denkt Ihr?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/security-management/img4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dies ist eine &lt;em&gt;Maßnahme&lt;/em&gt; die unternommen werden soll.
Eine Maßnahme hat die Aufgabe, ein &lt;em&gt;Risiko&lt;/em&gt; zu mitigieren, also abzuwehren oder zu entschärfen.
Laien reden über Security meistens in Form von Maßnahmen und dann kommt man schnell vom Hundertsten ins Tausendste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Maßnahme ist also &amp;ldquo;Stelle eine aktuelle Liste aller ssh Host-Keys bereit und fordere die Admins auf, beim ersten Login zu vergleichen&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/security-management/img5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schauen wir einmal auf das &lt;em&gt;Risiko&lt;/em&gt;:
Wogegen schützt ein solcher ssh Fingerprint?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der ssh Fingerprint schützt gegen das Unterschieben eines anderen physischen Hosts oder eines anderen ssh-Servers auf dem Zielhost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gibt es andere Maßnahmen, die gegen dasselbe Risiko wirken?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ja, wir könnten zum Beispiel auch einfach eine vorbereitete &amp;ldquo;known_hosts&amp;rdquo; Datei verteilen, in der nicht die Fingerprints drin sind, sondern die tatsächlichen Host Keys.
Dann würde beim Login gar kein Fingerprint mehr angezeigt werden, sondern die Identität per Host Key direkt automatisch geprüft werden.
Das wäre gleich viel Aufwand bei uns, und eine bessere UX bei den Admins.
Außerdem wäre die manuelle Kontrolle als Fehlerquelle beseitigt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eine andere Maßnahme, die gegen das gleiche Risiko besser wirkt, wäre bei gleichem Aufwand also besser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wie sind die Kosten eines Risikos generell zu bewerten?
Meistens macht man sich eine 3x3 Matrix aus Schadenshöhe (&amp;ldquo;teuer&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;das Jahresendergebnis beeinflussend&amp;rdquo; und &amp;ldquo;Wir sind pleite&amp;rdquo;) und Eintrittswahrscheinlichkeit (&amp;ldquo;selten&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;sehr selten&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;so gut wie nie&amp;rdquo;), und ordnet Risiken da ein.
Dem stellt man die einmaligen und laufenden Kosten der Maßnahme entgegen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wieso sind die Schadenshöhe und und Eintrittswahrscheinlichkeiten so komisch?
Nun, Dinge die billiger als &amp;ldquo;teuer sind&amp;rdquo; bezahlen wir und buchen das als &amp;ldquo;Cost of doing business&amp;rdquo;.
Wir akzeptieren die Risiken also und tragen die Kosten.
Und Dinge die häufiger als &amp;ldquo;selten&amp;rdquo; sind, sind keine Sicherheitsereignisse, also keine Ausnahmen, sondern müssen als operative Ereignisse im Tagesbetrieb abgehandelt werden können.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn wir einen Geschäftsprozess haben, in dem &amp;ldquo;teure&amp;rdquo; Dinge &amp;ldquo;häufig&amp;rdquo; sind, oder schlimmer, dann ist ein geregelter Geschäftsbetrieb mit den vorhandenen Prozessen nicht durchführbar und wir müssen das Geschäftsmodell oder seine Prozesse hinterfragen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/security-management/img6.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sicherheitsrisiken treten nicht einfach so auf und nicht jeder Angeifer kann einfach so Dinge tun.
Wir können Angreifer modellieren, ihnen Fertigkeiten (Capabilities) zuordnen und Risiken katalogisieren:
&amp;ldquo;Um dieses Risiko darzustellen, muss ein Angreifer diese Fertigkeiten haben, und daher kommt dieses Risiko nur bei diesem Angreifertyp vor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein Script-Kiddie könnte unsere Server &amp;ldquo;r00ten&amp;rdquo;, ein interner Angreifer könnte Maschinen oder Serverprozesse austauschen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;risikomanagement&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#risikomanagement&#34;&gt;
	Risikomanagement
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/security-management/img7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir bekommen also den folgenden Ablauf:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wir betrachten Risiken als Produkt aus Eintrittswahrscheinlichkeit und Schadenshöhe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wir betrachten Maßnahmen, und was sie mit dem Risiko tun (Eintrittswahrscheinlichkeit und Schadenshöhe reduzieren).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Das kostet Zeit und Geld.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Und danach in einer Schleife von vorn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/security-management/img8.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diese Schleife ist das Kennzeichen eines Prozesses im Gegensatz zu einem Projekt:
Security ist kein einmaliger Vorgang mit einer Deadline und einem Deliverable, sondern eine laufend wiederholte Identifikation, Bestimmung und Abmilderung von Risiken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wie jede Schleife muß auch diese Abbruchbedingungen haben:
Bestimmte Maßnahmen sind nicht akzeptabel. &amp;ldquo;Abziehen des Netzwerkkabels&amp;rdquo; hilft perfekt gegen &amp;ldquo;Script Kiddie r00tet den Server&amp;rdquo;, ist aber wegen der geschäftlichen Notwendigkeiten nicht akzeptabel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir können auch Kosten und Nutzen gegeneinander abwägen.
Maßnahmen finden ihre Grenze, wenn die Kosten für die Maßnahme den Schaden aus dem Risiko übersteigt.
Eventuell findet man dann einen Versicherer, der auf den Schadensfall wetten will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/security-management/img9.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Und damit bekommen wir den Risikomanagementzyklus, die grafische Darstellung dieser Schleife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/security-management/img10.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das &lt;em&gt;Risikomanagement&lt;/em&gt; identifiziert und bewertet allgemeine Risiken für den Geschäftsbetrieb.
Definiert Maßnahmen (konkrete Projekte) zur Risikobehandlung und kontrollieren deren Wirksamkeit.
Wie jeder Prozeß hat auch dieser Retroperspektiven, die regelmäßig durchgeführt werden und mit denen sich der Prozeß reguliert und optimiert.
Das ist der Management-Aspekt an der Sache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/security-management/img11.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es gibt viele verschiedene Managementmodelle, aber alle versuchen, die Durchführungsphase eines Prozesses (&amp;ldquo;Do&amp;rdquo;) von der Planungsphase und der Retroperspektive zu trennen.
Dadurch wird die Durchführungsebene von der Metaebene getrennt und der Prozeß selbst diskutierbar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein häufiger Prozeßzyklus folgt dem PCDA-Modell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;isms&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#isms&#34;&gt;
	ISMS
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der recht neue British Standard 7799 ist ein sehr kurzes Papier (nur 21 Seiten) und beschreibt den Aufbau eines Information Security Management Systems (ISMS)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;plan&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#plan&#34;&gt;
	Plan
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/security-management/img12.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan (establish the ISMS)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;security policy, objectives,targets,processes and procedures relevant to managing risk and improving information security to deliver results in accordance with an organization’s overall policies and objectives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/security-management/img13.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In den Termen einer deutschen Verwaltung also:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definiere einen Geltungsbereich des ISMS (definiere die Grenzen), und setze einen Auftrag durch Definition strategischer Ziele.
Definiere Stellen, also schaffe einen organisatorischen Rahmen.
Bestimmte Maße, nach denen wir das Funktionieren des ISMS bewerten wollen.
Legitimiere das ganze durch eine formelle Beauftragung und Delegation von Verantwortlichkeit an eine Leitung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wie deutsche Gesetze:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;so was gibt es als Konzept&amp;rdquo; (Das Grundgesetz)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Das bedeutet im Einzelfall&amp;rdquo; (Bundesgesetz)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;So machen wir das&amp;rdquo; (Durchführungsverordnung zum Gesetz)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/security-management/img14.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risikoidentifikation und Risikobewertung bilden dann die Matrix, die wir weiter oben schon erwähnt haben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir klassifizieren also, eventuell unter Hinzunahme von einem Standardkatalog, die zu schützenden Güter, mögliche Bedrohungen, Szenarien und Angreifermodelle, und eventuell eintretende Schäden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indem wir diesen Eintrittswahrscheinlichkeiten und Bewertungen zuordnen bekommen wir eine Liste an Dringlichkeiten, und eine Liste an möglichen Maßnahmen, die wir wiederum nach Geld und Möglichkeiten ordnen können.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unser Management kann diese Maßnahmen azeptieren, finanzieren und dann durchführen lassen oder das Risiko als Geschäftsrisiko hin nehmen.
Das Ergebnis dieser Entscheidung wird dokumentiert und dann durchgeführt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/security-management/img15.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risiken können wir behandeln indem wir&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sie akzeptieren (&amp;ldquo;is halt so&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sie vermeiden (&amp;ldquo;machen wir nicht&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sie transferieren (&amp;ldquo;is versichert, macht also nix&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;oder durch eine Maßmahme kontrollieren (der häufigste Fall, oder in Kombination mit der Versicherung)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Restrisiken&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nennen wir&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bewerten wir erneut (die PCDA Schleife dreht sich)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;oder lassen wir durch das Management abnehmen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-implement-and-operate-controls-processes-and-the-isms&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#do-implement-and-operate-controls-processes-and-the-isms&#34;&gt;
	Do (&amp;ldquo;implement and operate controls, processes and the ISMS&amp;rdquo;)
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/security-management/img16.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wieder im BS 7799: implement and operate the security policy, procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/security-management/img17.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Konkret also:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Den organisatorischen und personellen Rahmen schaffen
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stellen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mittel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feedback (&amp;ldquo;Indicent detection and handling&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;die Stellen besetzen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;die Personen ausbilden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;und Risiken und Maßnahmen thematisieren (&amp;ldquo;Awareness&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/security-management/img18.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steht der organisatorische Rahmen, kann man sich um die Technik kümmern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Überwachung und Monitoring
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Systemtests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Funktionstests und Integritätsbedingungen für die Business Logic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performancetests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incident Detection and Handling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;check-monitor-and-review-the-isms&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#check-monitor-and-review-the-isms&#34;&gt;
	Check (monitor and review the ISMS)
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/security-management/img19.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Assess and, where applicable, measure process performance against security policy, objectives and practical experience and report the results to management for review.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/security-management/img20.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zur Bewertung entfernt man sich sukzessive immer weiter von der Vorgabe und blickt zurück:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tun wir die Dinge wie vorgeschrieben, folgen wir der Anleitung (&amp;ldquo;Compliance&amp;rdquo;)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ist die Anleitung geeignet, die tatsächlich anfallenden Probleme zu lösen (&amp;ldquo;Effektivität&amp;rdquo;)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ist die Anleitung optimal, um die Probleme zu lösen (&amp;ldquo;Effizienz&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ist die Anleitung noch ein Bild der Realität im Unternehmen, und werden die aktuellen Prioritäten und Organisationsstrukturen korrekt abgebildet? (&amp;ldquo;Applicability&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;act&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#act&#34;&gt;
	Act
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/security-management/img21.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Take corrective and preventive actions, based on the results of the improvement of the ISMS.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2005/05/security-management/img22.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mit den Erkenntnissen aus der &amp;ldquo;Check&amp;rdquo;-Phase können wir unsere Prozesse debuggen und gewonnene Erkenntnisse umsetzen.
Prozesse zu ändern ist dann ein Projekt: Anleitungen werden angepasst und geschult.
Das ist etwas, das wir mit einem Termin versehen und prüfen können und bei dem wir Änderung mit dem &amp;ldquo;Vorher&amp;rdquo; vergleichen können.
Wir können das erkannte Muster auch auf andere Fälle transferieren, dokumentieren und lehren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Änderungen führen zu geänderten Anleitungen, zu angepassten Risikoabschätzungen, zu einem neuen Maßnahmenplan und zu neuen Prozessen und Prozeduren.
Kurzum: Zur nächsten Umdrehung im PCDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;themen&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BS 7799 definiert foilgende Tätigkeitfelder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security Policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organisatorische Infrastruktur
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asset Classification
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inventur&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sicherheitsbereiche&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Absolutes Maß der Security
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sehr schwer (&amp;ldquo;Wie beweisen wir, dass wir nicht gehackt sind?&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Systemadministration&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eine Aufgabe, die in sehr unterschiedlichen Größenordnungen kommt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ein mögliches Maß: Anzahl der betroffenen Benutzer
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10^1 - für sich selbst und seinen Partner oder für eine WG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10^3 - für einen kleinen Verein (&amp;ldquo;Toppoint e.V&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;INKA&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10^5 - für ein kleines Internet Unternehmen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10^7 - für ein großes Internet Unternehmen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Die Aufgabe verändert sich nicht, aber die möglichen Lösungen und die daran hängenden Strukturen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wachstum ist eine Folge von Erfolg
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ich muß mit meinem Erfolg wachsen. Ich kann nicht planen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beispiele:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stark schwankende Dienstenutzung (&amp;ldquo;Grußkarten&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strukturveränderung in Diensten (&amp;ldquo;POP3 vs. IMAP&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;SSL&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dienste mit unbekannter Akzeptanz (&amp;ldquo;Videomail&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dienstwachstum erfordert strukturelle Veränderung (&amp;ldquo;Freemail&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;limits&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardwaregrenzen
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intel-Hardware: 4 CPU, x GB RAM, 60 MB/sec Random I/O&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Softwaregrenzen
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Die verwendete Datenbank fällt bei bestimmten Daten- und Lastgrößenordnungen schlicht auseinander oder degradiert über die Zeit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hotspots
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ein stark belasteter Block bremst die Gesamtperformance eines RAID-Systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wachstum erfolgt aus dem Betrieb
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Jetzt wachsen&amp;rdquo; =&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;mehr Kisten&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kurzfristige und längerfristige Lösungen gleichzeitig verfolgen
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Das ist nicht immer schön&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lastverteilung:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DNS RR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loadbalancer Appliance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linux Virtual Server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applikation verteilt (login, hashes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schreibrate beeinflußt die Architektur
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Livebetrieb auf Snapshots und Kopien&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zentrale Datenhaltung bildet Flaschenhälse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anwendungen verteilbar realisieren&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dezentralisierung funktioniert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limits in der verfügbaren Hard- und Software erzwingen dezentrale Systeme
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zentrale Systeme haben immer ein wachstumsbegrenzendes Limit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verteilung:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zustand bremst. Zustandslos verteilen!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writes bremsen. Dezentral schreiben!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synchronisation bremst. Asynchrone Strukturen bauen!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Architektur vs. Betriebliche Erfordernisse

&lt;li&gt;Manche Probleme löst man nur durch brachiale Gewalt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Das Resultat ist niemals ästhetisch.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aber es macht die Kasse voll. :)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Informatiker-Lösung:

&lt;li&gt;Details wegabstrahieren&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Folge:
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Definitiv immer weniger.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Enterprise Mail: große Mailsysteme, kleine Schmerzen</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2002/02/01/enterprise-mail.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2002 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2002/02/01/enterprise-mail.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;enterprise-mail&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#enterprise-mail&#34;&gt;
	Enterprise Mail
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2002/02/enterprise-mail.001.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Folien für eine interne Mitarbeiterschulung: Umzug und Erweiterung des Mailsystems bei mobilcom.de; für die evangelische Landeskirche Schleswig-Holstein; für Ver.di.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;was-ist-enterprise-level&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#was-ist-enterprise-level&#34;&gt;
	Was ist Enterprise Level?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2002/02/enterprise-mail.002.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ausfallsicher&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bei Hardwareschaden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bei Mailwellen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skalierbar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;über alle User&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pro User
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mails pro Ordner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Order pro User&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pro Standort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pro Domain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrierbar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keine Firma ab einer bestimmten Größe hat ein homogenes Mailsystem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unterschiedliche Zugänge
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;für Anwender: POP3/IMAP4, mit SSL?, über Web?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Für Anwendungen: Virus-Scanner? Mailinglisten? Pflegeinterfaces?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mail ist missionskritisch, inhomogen, Lock-In unbedingt vermeiden.
Offene Software, offene Protokolle -&amp;gt; freie Wahl der Clients, freie Wahl der Serverkomponenten (Soft- und Hardware)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;bessere Skalierbarkeit, bessere Erweiterbarkeit, bessere Integrierbarkeit ins Backend&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;hardwarekonzept&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#hardwarekonzept&#34;&gt;
	Hardwarekonzept
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2002/02/enterprise-mail.003.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mailserver doppelt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jede Maschine kann für beide übernehmen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storage doppelt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jedes Array hat alle Daten
Multipathing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mehrere NICs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mehrere Kabelwege&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sehr zufrieden mit dem Hardware-Range von Sun:
Hardware für jede Größe von der kleinen X1 bis zur E15K, Software ist portabel über den gesamten Range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Großer Schwerpunkt auf ausfallsichere Hardware:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multipathing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hot Plug&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ausfallszenarien:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kiste fällt aus
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Migration der IP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Migration der Platten&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Platte fällt aus
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RAID 1 (Veritas)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;softwarekonzept&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#softwarekonzept&#34;&gt;
	Softwarekonzept
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2002/02/enterprise-mail.004.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Einsatz von Standardprotokollen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;POP3, IMAP4, LMTP, SMTP, LDAP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Einsatz von Standardsoftware&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sendmail 8.12.1, Cyrus IMAP, perdition Proxy, Veritas (VM, FS, CS), iPlanet Directory 4.x, Interscan Viruswall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iPlanet war vorgegeben, da das führende LDAP iPlanet war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veritas war vorgegeben, hat sich als sehr gute Wahl herausgestellt: Entwicklung von failover-Scripten harmlos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viruscheck vorgegeben: InterScan im Einsatz bei NetUSE, Kunden arbeiten auch mit Amavis und NAI oder anderen Systemen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;eigentliche Arbeitstiere sind freie Software:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sendmail 8.12.1 hat bessere LDAP-Integration
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sendmail ist eigentlich ein MTA-SDK :-)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;perdition ist ein sehr leistungsfähiger Proxy
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plugin-Architektur&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extrem gutmütig im Deployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;übersichtlicher Code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cyrus ist ein sehr skalierbarer POP/IMAP-Server
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;schlecht dokumentiert&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eigenwillige Authentisierungsbibliothek SASL (Exkurs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ordentliche Architektur&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;skalierbarkeit&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#skalierbarkeit&#34;&gt;
	Skalierbarkeit
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2002/02/enterprise-mail.005.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sizing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;per User: 1 MB RAM, 2 MB Swap, 1 MHz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IMAP braucht mehr&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSL braucht mehr!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;angemessen Plattenplatz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wieviel Plattenplatz ist angemessen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 Kategorien
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 MB, 20 MB, 200 MB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jede Kategorie ist
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(großes Modell) 5 mal seltener als die vorhergehende&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(kleines Modell) 10 mal seltener als die vorhergehende&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;skalierbarkeit-ii&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#skalierbarkeit-ii&#34;&gt;
	Skalierbarkeit II
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2002/02/enterprise-mail.006.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anwendungsbeispiel: ~5000 User&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;700 zugleich verbunden, 100 davon mit IMAP
ergeben:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1400 MB RAM, 3800 MB Swap, 700+ MHz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;27 oder 63 GB Mailstore&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;kleines Modell (27 GB)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4500&lt;em&gt;2 MB + 450&lt;/em&gt;20 MB + 45*200 MB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;großes Modell (63 GB)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4500&lt;em&gt;2 MB + 900&lt;/em&gt;20 MB + 180*200 MB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zahlen wurden auf Linux/Intel ermittelt, und an eigener Cyrus-Installation validiert. Zahlen an der Ist-Installation des Kunden validiert. Skalierbarkeit weitgehend linear. Problem ist partitionierbar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;migration&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#migration&#34;&gt;
	Migration
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2002/02/enterprise-mail.007.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Konvertierung&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;des vorhandenen Mailstore, der vorhandenen Aliases, der vorhandenen Listeninfrastruktur, der vorhandenen Routingstruktur&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nahtlose Migration durch &amp;ldquo;Rückzug&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wechsel von Kopfsteinpflaster auf Autobahn während der Hauptreisezeit&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vorbereitung der Konvertierung&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Umstellung auf das neue System&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Durchrouten auf das alte System&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Während der Konvertierung &amp;ldquo;Rückzug&amp;rdquo; auf das neue System&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Konvertierung des Ist-Bestandes ist aufwendiger, fehleranfälliger als geplant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;System ist grundsätzlich funktionsfähig; Umstellung ist wesentlich holperiger gewesen als intendiert; Umstellungsaufwand auch bei den Anwendern&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;migration-ii&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#migration-ii&#34;&gt;
	Migration II
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2002/02/enterprise-mail.008.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typische Probleme:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lustige Ordernamen (IMAP)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;defekte Aliasdaten&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Datenbestand nicht komplett&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wechselndes Mailrouting
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hosts liefern mit unerwarteten Namen ein&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LDAP-Routing verhält sich anders als statisches Routing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Umstellung für IMAP-Clients nicht transparent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CAPABILITY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IMAP Subscriptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ordnernamen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lage des Sent-Folders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Umstellung für POP3-Clients weitgehend transparent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;triviales Protokoll&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nicht erweiterbar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finaler Mailstore auf dem Client&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMAP ist ein modulares Protokoll: Extensions sind nicht kompatibel, Normung ist nicht rigide genug.
Propietäre Erweiterungen machen den Wechsel schwer
Unterschätze niemals den Einfallsreichtum von Anwendern bei der Vergabe von Ordnernamen.
Unterschätze niemals die tägliche Zielverschiebung durch das Tagesgeschäft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verteiltes Setup: 50+ Standorte, Workgroup-Size pro Standort, zentrale Administration, Begrenzte Hardwarekapazität&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Großes Setup&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;70 000+ Anwender
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Überblick:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Eigenschaften von LDAP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eigenschaften von SQL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anwendungsbereiche von LDAP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anwendungsbereiche von SQL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strukturelle Probleme beim Einsatz von LDAP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warum wird LDAP dennoch verwendet?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gibt es weniger problematische Alternativen?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;ldap-im-schnelldurchlauf&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#ldap-im-schnelldurchlauf&#34;&gt;
	LDAP im Schnelldurchlauf
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2002/01/dir_vs_rel.002.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wald von Bäumen aus Knoten&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jeder Knoten hat mindestens die Attribute &lt;code&gt;dn&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;objectClass&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attribute sind ein- oder mehrwertig, haben Syntax (Typ)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Besonderes mehrwertiges Attribut &lt;code&gt;objectClass&lt;/code&gt; bestimmt, welche Attribute vorhanden sind MÜSSEN und DÜRFEN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Einwertiges Attribut &lt;code&gt;dn&lt;/code&gt; enthält den Pfad durch den Baum und ist Schlüssel (PK)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novell Directory Services, Active Directory und LDAP basieren auf den Ideen von X.500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das Verzeichnis ist ein Wald von Wald von Knoten, Knoten haben Attribute, mindestens &lt;code&gt;dn&lt;/code&gt; und &lt;code&gt;objectClass&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Vereinigungsmenge von &lt;code&gt;objectClasses&lt;/code&gt; definiert, welche Attribute der Knoten haben MUSS und KANN. Dies entspricht NULL/NOT NULL in SQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attribute haben eine Syntax (einen Typ). Attribute können einwertig (etwa: &lt;code&gt;dn&lt;/code&gt;) oder mehrwertig (etwa: &lt;code&gt;objectClass&lt;/code&gt;) sein.
Mehrwertige Attribute sind ein Verstoß gegen die 1NF in SQL und müssen in SQL in externe Tabellen ausgelagert werden.
Denormalisierungen ziehen idR Anomalien bei INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE nach sich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der &lt;code&gt;dn&lt;/code&gt; beschreibt den Pfad durch den Baum und ist PK. PKs sollen strukturlos und invariant sein. Daß der &lt;code&gt;dn&lt;/code&gt; nicht strukturlos ist, wird sich als bitteres Problem herausstellen. Daß der &lt;code&gt;dn&lt;/code&gt; Positionsinformation enthält wird ihn nahezu unbrauchbar als PK machen (aber LDAP offeriert keine Alternative).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;sql-im-schnelldurchlauf&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#sql-im-schnelldurchlauf&#34;&gt;
	SQL im Schnelldurchlauf
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Datenbank als Kollektion von Tabellen, Tabellen als Kollektion von Spalten, Spalten haben Typen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spalten sind NULL, NOT NULL. Spalten sind einwertig.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eine Spalte oder Gruppe von Spalten ist der PK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spaltendefinitionen mit Typen definieren ein rigides Typschema, das nur durch Nullwerte geringfügig aufgelockert wird.
Dennoch flexible Struktur, da über Beziehungen zwischen Tabellen variable Verbindungen aufgezogen werden können.
Schlüssel und Integritätsbedingungen sind frei definierbar und frei wählbar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Umfangreiches Handwerkszeug zur Definition von Datenstrukturen und deren Pflege vorhanden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;sql-operationen&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#sql-operationen&#34;&gt;
	SQL Operationen
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2002/01/dir_vs_rel.004.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQL erlaubt komplexe Operationen auf Tabellen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selektion (WHERE-Clause) wählt Zeilen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projektion (Spaltenliste) wählt Spalten&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aggregation (GROUP BY-Clause) erlaubt Zählungen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join erlaubt Tabellenverknüpfungen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rename erlaubt Self-Joins und damit rekursive Strukturen (Bäume etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das Ergebnis jeder Operation ist wieder eine Tabelle. Mit Subqueries kann die generierte Tabelle weiter verarbeitet werden (Relationen &amp;ldquo;Algebra&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diese fünf Operationen erlauben es, den auf viele Tabellen verstreuten (normalisierten) Bestand dynamisch zu rekombinieren. Dabei sind auch Rekombinationen möglich, die ursprünglich nicht antizipiert wurden (Ad-Hoc Queries).
Ad-Hoc Queries sind ein typisches Phänomen bei der Recherche und der Reportgenerierung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQL ist mächtig genug, um selbstreferentielle Strukturen definieren zu können.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eine Reihe von Einbaufunktionen entlastet den Client noch weiter und erlaubt es, beträchtliche Teile der Logik im Server ablaufen zu lassen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Laden von Konfigurationsobjekten aus dem LDAP-Server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinnvolle Anwendungen von SQL: Stay and Run-Anwendungen; eine Verbindung, viele Queries. Möglichst viele Daten auf dem Server verwerfen, nur die notwendigen Daten übertragen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Komplexe und konkurrente Updates; Locks; Transaktionen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business Logic an den persistenten Objekten der Anwendung speichern, Daten werden zwischen verschiedenen Anwendungen shareable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Integritäts- und Update-Logik für diese Daten klebt an den Daten, nicht in den verschiedenen Anwendungen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kein Zugriff, insbesondere kein schreibender Zugriff an dieser Logik vorbei möglich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woher kommen die Daten im Verzeichnis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Welches ist das führende System?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wie strukturiere ich den Verzeichnisbaum?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nebenbedingungen:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replikation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Naming Attributes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wie strukturiere ich meine objectClasses?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Welche Art von Anfragen wird erwartet?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sollte ich nicht doch lieber ein RDBMs nehmen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das Hauptproblem besteht oft darin, daß versucht wird, LDAP für mehr als simple Logins einzusetzen.
Selektion und Projektion sind vorhanden; Aggregation, Join und Rename nicht.
LDAP-Struktur muss die auftretenden Anfragen antizipieren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PKs sind instabil.
Nebenbedingungen der Replikation machen stabile PKs oft unmöglich.
Diese Faktoren bestimmen das Design von LDAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lachhafte technische Basis erzeugt eigenartige technische Anforderungen.
LDAP-Server halten den Datenbestand effektiv im RAM.
Der Datenbestand kann daher eine vorbestimmte Größe kaum überschreiten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDAP-Server geben nur partiell relevante technische Daten an: Queries/sec nicht mit SQL vergleichbar.
Wo ein LDAP 40.000 Queries braucht, kommt SQL mit einem Join hin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDAP wird als führende Datenbank eingesetzt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDAP wird stark beschrieben&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDAP wird konkurrent beschrieben&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDAP dynamisch beschrieben&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es bestehen abzufragende Beziehungen zwischen LDAP-Objekten&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDAP wird zur Reportgenerierung verwendet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der LDAP-Bestand wird hierarchisch strukturiert&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der LDAP-Bestand muss hierarchisch strukturiert werden&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setzt man LDAP als Verzeichnisdienst (also als Logindatenbank) ein, kann es funktionieren.
Jeder andere Ansatz wird sehr, sehr weh tun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;ldap-wird-als-führende-datenbank-eingesetzt&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#ldap-wird-als-f%c3%bchrende-datenbank-eingesetzt&#34;&gt;
	LDAP wird als führende Datenbank eingesetzt
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDAP-Attribute haben eine Syntax (einen Typ)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typen sind zahlreich und im Standard vordefiniert&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typen sind schwer erweiterbar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integritätsbedingungen können nicht definiert werden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iPlanet erlaubt Plugins, die Integrität checken können.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beziehungen zwischen Objekten sind in LDAP nur schwer darstellbar und instabil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PK ist immer der &lt;code&gt;dn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;dn&lt;/code&gt;s sind jedoch unter Umständen instabil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aliases sind ein optionales Feature von LDAP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nur Blattknoten können Aliases sein.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDAP bietet nicht die adäquaten Mechanismen, um als führende Datenbank eingesetzt werden zu können:
Intra-Objekt-Integrität nur durch Typen (Syntaxen) gewährleistet, keine Trigger, keine Foreign Keys.
Inter-Objekt-Integrität nur durch propietäre Plugins (Compilate) gewährleistet, keine Stored Procedures, Trigger, Rules.
Typensystem nicht durch Definitionen oder Einschränkungen erweiterbar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keine Joins, Renames, und damit keine Relationen.
Nachbildung von Joins durch Prejoins (Struktur oder Aliases) oder durch iterative Queries.
Iterative Queries erzeugen wahnwitzigen Traffic im Netz und auf dem Server.
Beispiel: Liste von Usern nach Standorten&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDAP ist als Protokoll für Leseoperationen optimiert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es existiert noch kein standardisiertes Bulk-Update Protokoll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In OpenLDAP und iPlanet ist der LDAP-Datenspeicher ein Sleepycat DB/3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In einigen LDAP-Servern sind Schreiboperationen ungeschickt implementiert: Flush nach jedem Write.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replikation zwischen Servern skaliert sich nicht gut bei starken Schreiboperationen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nicht standarisiert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oft als reguläre Schreiboperation eines privilegierten Benutzers implementiert (&amp;ldquo;triviale Implementierung&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iPlanet kann immerhin out-of-sync Replica automatisch neu aufbauen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In älteren LDAP-Servern flog nach heftigen Updates die Replica weg:
Jedes Write auf den Server gab ein Write auf der Replication.
Jedes Write gab ein Flush auf die Platte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDAP ist zwar standardisiert, aber heterogene Replikation ist dennoch noch immer eine schwarze Kunst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn Replikation über reguläre Writes mit einem speziellen User realisiert ist, skaliert sie sich nicht gut.
Proprietäre Bulk-Updates skalieren sich gut, erzwingen aber homogene Serverinstallationen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LDAP definiert einzelne add oder modify-Operationen als atomar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LDAP kennt keine Locks und keine Transaktionen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synchronisation und Konsistenz sind damit Sache der Anwendung.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hierzu ist wenig zu sagen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ohne Transaktionen kein Undo von mehrteiligen Updates, keine Read-Konsistenz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ohne Locks ist so etwas auch kaum nachbildbar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beispiele:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vergabe von uids beim Usereintrag durch klassischen read-modify-write-Zyklus:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bestimme höchste belegte UID.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ermittele nächsthöhere UID.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Belege diese UID im LDAP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Da keine Locks vorhanden sind, ist rmw nicht implementierbar (aber UID kann als Attribut UNIQUE gesetzt werden).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Damit schlägt ein doppelter ADD fehl -&amp;gt; retry (Potential für Livelock)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;ldap-wird-dynamisch-beschreiben&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#ldap-wird-dynamisch-beschreiben&#34;&gt;
	LDAP wird dynamisch beschreiben
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2002/01/dir_vs_rel.012.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viele LDAP-Server speichern die Schema-Definition out-of-band&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Externe Dateien, die per include in die Serverkonfiguration mit eingebunden werden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damit ist eine Änderung des Schemas im Betrieb und durch LDAP unmöglich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dies fördert sehr entspannte objectClass-Definitionen (&lt;code&gt;MAY&lt;/code&gt;-Inflation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out-of-band Schemadefinition macht Introspektion schwierig&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Welche &lt;code&gt;objectClasses&lt;/code&gt; kennt der Server? Welche Attribute erlauben und definieren sie?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamische Schemadefinition ist nur in esoterischen Anwendungen von Bedeutung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entwicklungssysteme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generische Infrasturkturanwendungen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ähnliche Argumentationen gelten für Introspektion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;beziehungen-zwischen-ldap-objekten&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#beziehungen-zwischen-ldap-objekten&#34;&gt;
	Beziehungen zwischen LDAP-Objekten
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2002/01/dir_vs_rel.013.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der PK in LDAP ist immer der &lt;code&gt;dn&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Der &lt;code&gt;dn&lt;/code&gt; ist nicht opaque, sondern hat Struktur: Pfadinformation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Konsequenz: &lt;code&gt;dn&lt;/code&gt;s sind instabil.
Verschiebt man ein Objekt im Baum, ändert sich der &lt;code&gt;dn&lt;/code&gt;.
Damit sind alle Referenzen auf das Objekt ungültig.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iPlanet &lt;code&gt;dn&lt;/code&gt; Plugin; cascading Updates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDAP kennt keine JOIN-Operation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prejoined Structures über Aliases oder andere Referenzen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keine dynamisch zusammengesetzten Strukturen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aliases sind nicht generisch (Leaf-Nodes only).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDAP kennt kein Join (und kein Rename): Art der antizipierten Anfragen bestimmt die Struktur des Schema.
Ad-Hoc Anfragen sind prinzipiell nicht oder nur mit gewaltigem Overhead realisierbar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bei Kenntnis der Struktur ist die Konstruktion einer pathologischen Anfrage eine Fingerübung für den geübten Designer:
Invertiere die Struktur und konstruiere eine sinnvolle Anfrage auf der invertierten Struktur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Da der &lt;code&gt;dn&lt;/code&gt; nicht opak ist, sind keine stabilen Referenzen implementierbar.
&lt;code&gt;dn&lt;/code&gt;-Rename Plugin von iPlanet generiert entsprechend gewaltige Serverlast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;ldap-wird-zur-reportgenerierung-verwendet&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#ldap-wird-zur-reportgenerierung-verwendet&#34;&gt;
	LDAP wird zur Reportgenerierung verwendet
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2002/01/dir_vs_rel.014.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDAP kennt keine Aggregation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reports können nur durch Durchlesen des Bestandes erstellt werden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDAP kennt keine serverseitigen Funktionen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Funktionswerte können nur durch Durchlesen des Bestandes erstellt werden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDAP kennt keinen JOIN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reports machen oft Gebrauch von ad-hoc Beziehungen zwischen Teilmengen, aber ohne Join können diese nicht effizient generiert werden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beispiele:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Welche Mitarbeiter haben mehr als einen PC?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Welche PC werden von mehr als einem Mitarbeiter verwendet?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beachte die Invertierung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDAP hat keine Einbaufunktionen.
Statistiken scheiden ganz aus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;hierarchische-struktur-im-ldap-i&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#hierarchische-struktur-im-ldap-i&#34;&gt;
	Hierarchische Struktur im LDAP I
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2002/01/dir_vs_rel.015.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der PK in LDAP ist immer der &lt;code&gt;dn&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der &lt;code&gt;dn&lt;/code&gt; enthält Strukturinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ändert sich die Position eines Objektes in der Struktur, ändert sich der PK dieses Objektes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klassischer Fall von nicht normalisierter Struktur: Daten und Struktur nicht getrennt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein Objekt ist oft Mitglied in verschiedenen Hierarchien&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mitarbeiter ist einsortiert
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;organisatorisch (&amp;ldquo;Abteilung 1.3.2&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;räumlich (&amp;ldquo;Deutschland, SH, Kiel, Hauptstelle&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;projektbezogen (&amp;ldquo;IT Infrastruktur, Netzwerke, UMTS-Pilot&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redundante Datenhaltung durch nicht normalisiertes Datenmodell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veränderliche PKs, Datenbankdesigners Alptraum: nicht normalisiert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baumstruktur enthält die Daten selbst, keine Referenzen auf die Daten&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nur ein Baum, nicht mehrere, möglich&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besser:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unstrukturierte Menge von Objekten&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baumstruktur mit Zeigern in diese Objekte.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;hierarchische-struktur-im-ldap-ii&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#hierarchische-struktur-im-ldap-ii&#34;&gt;
	Hierarchische Struktur im LDAP II
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2002/01/dir_vs_rel.016.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDAP erlaubt die Partitionierung des Bestandes nur nach Teilbäumen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erzwingt die Bildung von Hierarchien im Bestand&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erzwingt damit instabile &lt;code&gt;dn&lt;/code&gt;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partition: Vollständige Überdeckung durch disjunkte Teilmengen. Definiert Äquivalenzklassen (etwa: gerade, ungerade).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partition: Wird für Replikation gebraucht&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Triviale Partition: Identität.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDAP partitioniert nur nach Naming Attributes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle partitioniert nach beliebigen Prädikaten zur Äquivalenzklassenbildung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replikation erzwingt hierarchische Struktur, die Eingang in den &lt;code&gt;dn&lt;/code&gt; findet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migriert ein Objekt von einer Partition in eine andere (&amp;ldquo;Standortwechsel&amp;rdquo;), ändert sich zwingend der &lt;code&gt;dn&lt;/code&gt; und damit werden alle Referenzen ungültig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Großes Dilemma!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir designen: 3-Level-LDAP, wann immer möglich (&lt;code&gt;ou=tablename, o=company, c=de&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;fazit-i&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#fazit-i&#34;&gt;
	Fazit I
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2002/01/dir_vs_rel.017.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LDAP ist der Teil von X.500, der &amp;ldquo;brauchbar&amp;rdquo; war.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LDAP verwirft elementare Erkenntnisse des relationalen Datenmodells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Damit ist auch der brauchbare Teil von LDAP aus der Sicht des Datenbankdesigners unbrauchbar und gefährlich.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Der Einsatz von LDAP als führende Datenbank ist zu vermeiden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LDAP-Bestände sind möglichst als flache Tabellen zu strukturieren.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nichttriviale Dinge sind mit LDAP nicht zu realisieren.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Triviale Dinge sind mit LDAP schwierig oder gefährlich.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDAP verstößt so ziemlich gegen jeden Grundsatz des relationalen Modells:
Nicht 3., nicht 2., ja nicht einmal 1. NF
Daten aus dem LDAP sind damit kaum weiterzuverarbeiten&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDAP ist gefährlich, wenn LDAP führendes oder feedendes System ist.
LDAP ist eine Datensackgasse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wie kann es sein? Haben die alle in Datenbanken 101 gepennt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;warum-dann-keine-relationalen-systeme&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#warum-dann-keine-relationalen-systeme&#34;&gt;
	Warum dann keine relationalen Systeme?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2002/01/dir_vs_rel.018.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutschland, 9.00 Uhr:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;150.000 MA loggen sich ein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jedes Login ist ein Connect, gefolgt von einem Disconnect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeder Connect erzeugt in Oracle einen fork, einen exec und einen 5 MB schweren Subprozeß, der dann sofort weggeworfen wird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDAP als wire-protocol ist genormt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDAP als query-language ist unbrauchbar, aber sehr rigide genormt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDAP ist auf connect/disconnect optimiert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionelle RDBMs sind zu heavyweight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industriefehlschlag: Kein ausreichend genormtes wire protocol&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ODBC: too little, too late&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industriefehlschlag: Keine ausreichend leichtwiegigen SQL-Datenbankprodukte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aber: MySQL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;warum-dann-kein-mysql&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#warum-dann-kein-mysql&#34;&gt;
	Warum dann kein MYSQL?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2002/01/dir_vs_rel.019.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MySQL?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connect/disconnect problemlos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;read-mostly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replikation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hat volle SQL-Syntax&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selektion, Projektion, Aggregation, Join, Rename&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speichereffizienter als iPlanet oder OpenLDAP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Als wire protocol nicht genormt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aber: Source liegt offen, GPL bzw. LGPL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In kommerziellen Clients nicht unterstützt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aber mod_auth_mysql, PAM usw&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trivial zu implementieren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kein IETF-Prozeß.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MySQL ist in vielen Fällen gegenüber LDAP eine echte Alternative:
bessere Performance und Skalierbarkeit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leichter in SQL-Feeder integrierbar wegen kongruenter Datenstrukturen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weniger lächerlicher Ressourcenverbrauch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;und-xml&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#und-xml&#34;&gt;
	Und XML?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2002/01/dir_vs_rel.020.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDAP und XML haben strukturell viel gemeinsam&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rückkehr zu hierarchischen (Datenbank-) Systemen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liste der Nachteile dieser Systeme in Datenbanken 101 nachlesbar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keine führende Datenhaltung in hierarchischen Systemen! Wir haben in den Betrieben für viel Geld diesen Unsinn gerade ausgerottet und nun kommt er mit wieder. Mit Macht!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genau wie LDAP implementiert auch XML ein schwach getyptes hierarchisches Modell zur Datenspeicherung und eine relational unvollständige Abfragesprache (Xpath, Xquery).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XML-Speicher müssen genau untersucht werden:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transportspeicher sind okay (SOAP, WDDX etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lagerspeicher sind gefährlich und müssen relational normalisiert werden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XML generiert als Bonus gewaltige Speicher- und Parser-Overheads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kann ein Binärprotokoll verwendet werden?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XML und Java gehen gut zusammen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;groß, teuer, hip, technisch partiell irrsinnig&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publishing Pipeline und Kopiequalität
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Länge 2, Länge &amp;lt; 2?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Kommunikations-Infrastruktur&amp;rdquo;: Obwohl mehr Leute als je zuvor am Zustandekommen einer einzelnen Kommunikation beteiligt sind, ist die einzelne Kommunikation immer individueller geworden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treiber ist nur problemfrei installierbar, wenn er durch den OS Hersteller signiert ist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;noch hypothetisch, aber im Spielkonsolenmarkt üblich:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Softwarehersteller zahlen für das Recht, für eine Konsole (ein Betriebssystem) entwickeln zu können.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auch in Windows denkbar (CPRM und Display Encryption): trusted applications brauchen eine Signatur durch den OS-Hersteller

&lt;li&gt;Internet-Dienstanbieter möchte Content über das Internet verteilen:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Content muß sich in das Windows DRM einfügen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dazu muß der Inhalt die richtigen Signaturen tragen.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wie zuvor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dazu muß der Käufer identifiziert werden.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MS Passport
→  Lock-In für Shophersteller
→ Kein anonymer Netzzugriff mehr möglich&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biometrie zufügen und auch die Jugendschützer sind zufrieden&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;herkömmliche Distributoren?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autoren, Musiker, Werkschaffende?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Definiert nur sehr wenige Tags
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ruft bei Druck der Service-Taste eine vordefinierte Seite auf
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diese Seite bekommt keine Parameter
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Das ist doof!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upcase?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;CiscoIPPhone&lt;/code&gt; Prefix statt Namespace?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wahrscheinlich keine vollständige XML-Implementierung
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dafür ist das Phone viel zu klein&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Häufig, daher Standard nur begrenzt von Wert&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MenuItem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name, URL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist nur für wunderliche Sprachen sinnvoll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;http-parameter&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#http-parameter&#34;&gt;
	HTTP Parameter
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refresh
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time (Seconds)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;URL (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Content-Type
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cisco dokumentiert ContentType !!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expires
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expired pages will not be added to the URL stack of the phone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;xml-normensalat&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#xml-normensalat&#34;&gt;
	XML Normensalat
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2000/11/xml-grundlagen.001.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XML ist ein sehr unübersichtliches Thema, bestehtend aus einem Strauß von ca. 10 Normen.
Einige dieser Normen sind zueinander inkompatibel.
Vieles ist noch experimentell, oder noch nicht verabschiedet.
Was schon da ist und funktioniert ist jedoch sehr interessant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir kennen die Normen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTML 4.0 -&amp;gt; XHTML 1.0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XML, XML DTD, Namespaces, DOM, SAX, CSS, Xlink, XPath, XQuery, XML Schema und XSLT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das Versprechen: Vereinfachung, Flexibilität und Datenbankintegration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;warum-xml&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#warum-xml&#34;&gt;
	Warum XML?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2000/11/xml-grundlagen.002.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XML als Standard erscheint 1996 als eine Markup-Variante von SGML, aber regulärer und einfacher zu parsen.
Das Ziel der Norm ist ein vereinheitlichtes Datentauschformat für die Industrie mit den Eigenschaften &amp;ldquo;Self-Describing&amp;rdquo; und &amp;ldquo;lang, aber gut komprimierbar&amp;rdquo;, Ablösung von &amp;ldquo;EDIFACT&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Für den Entwickler ist das Versprechen Vereinfachung durch normierte Parser und einfache Varidierung durch normierte Datenschemata.
API-Normen sind SAX (streaming Parser) und DOM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;sgml-xml-html&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#sgml-xml-html&#34;&gt;
	SGML, XML, HTML
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2000/11/xml-grundlagen.003.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTML ist &lt;em&gt;eine&lt;/em&gt; SGML, mit einem vorgeschriebenen festen Tag-Vokabular, für die spezielle Anwendung &amp;ldquo;Display von Seiten&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SGML als Metanorm erlaubt aber die Definition von beliebigen Seitenbeschreibungssprachen.
SGML selbst ist eine weitgehend unbekannte IBM-Technologie aus den 70er Jahren, und das merkt man an vielen Stellen.
Ohne eine DTD (ein Sprachschema) ist eine SGML nicht parsebar, cf HTML (&amp;ldquo;IMG&amp;rdquo;-Element muss nicht geschlossen werden, andere schon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die DTD für XML definiert eine Sprache, die wohlgeformt ist (Klammerbaum ohne frei stehende Tag, ohne Boolean-Attribute, mit ein paar Vereinfachungen für Srings und Klammern)
Wegen der Regelmäßigkeit ist XML ohne DTD parsebar, auch wenn man die Bedeutung der Elemente nicht kennt.
Durch die optionale DTD wird XML validierbar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;normenumfeld&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#normenumfeld&#34;&gt;
	Normenumfeld
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2000/11/xml-grundlagen.004.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTML 4 (strict) und CSS 2 sind eine Erweiterung und Bereinigung von HTML 3.2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XML und XML DTD sind eine Art Markup-Sprache mit frei definierbaren Tags, also alleine erst mal sinnlos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XHTML ist eine Schreibweise von HTML nach den Regeln von XML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAX und DOM sind zwei genormte Parser-APIs, für jede dieser APIs kann es viele unterschiedliche Parser geben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Namespaces definieren Verfahren zum Mischen zweier XML-DTDs, Ziel ist die Vermeidung von Namenskollisionen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mit XSLT kann man eine Transformation von einem XML zu einem anderen XML spezifizieren, etwa ein Business-XML in XHTML. Ich habe das im Rahmen der dclp FAQ genutzt, um eine FAQ in XML zu schreiben und als HTML-Dokument zu rendern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;normenumfeld-ii&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#normenumfeld-ii&#34;&gt;
	Normenumfeld II
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2000/11/xml-grundlagen.005.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Im Business-Umfeld müssen oft Datenaustauschformate spezifiziert werden.
Dazu ist ein Schema notwendig.
XML DTD ist dazu oft zu sperrig und definiert auch keine Datentypen, die für Programmiersprachen nutzbringend werden.
XML Schema schafft Abhilfe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zum Ausschneiden und Adressieren von Dingen in XML-Dokumenten XQuery, XPath und XPointer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anwendungen von XML finden wir in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PICS: Jugendschutz Labels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RDF: Allgemeine Objektbeziehungen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P3P: Automatischer Vertragsschluß, hier: Privacy Statements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XML RPC&amp;lt; SOAP: RPC über HTTP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;xml-syntax-i-tags&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#xml-syntax-i-tags&#34;&gt;
	XML Syntax I: Tags
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2000/11/xml-grundlagen.006.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XML ist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;case sensitive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;verwendet als Zeichensatz überall Unicode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;erlaubt verkürzte Schreibweise leerer Elemente: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;bla&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/bla&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; wird zu &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;bla/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;verlangt saubere Klammergebirge: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;bla&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Die Tags mit der Sequenz &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;xml*&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/xml*&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; sind reserviert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;xml-syntax-ii-attributes-entities&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#xml-syntax-ii-attributes-entities&#34;&gt;
	XML Syntax II: Attributes, Entities
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2000/11/xml-grundlagen.007.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tags könnnen Attribute haben. Die sind ebenfalls Case Sensitive, einmalig pro Tag, und müssen zwingend Werte in Anführungszeichen haben (einfache oder doppelte).
Leere Attribute werden durch Wiederholung des Namens als String geschrieben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zeichendaten werden geparsed, das führt zu Entities.
Zwingend sind &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; und &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;, auch &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;apos;&lt;/code&gt; und &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;.
Beliebige Zeichen sind per Zeichencode definierbar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die DTD kann weitere Entities vordefinieren.
Diese können auch externe Files referenzieren.
Dadurch bekommmt man einen Include-Mechanismus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oder Literale mit CDATA: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;[CDATA[&amp;lt;&amp;amp;&amp;gt;&#39;&amp;quot;]]&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;xml-syntax-iii-whitespace-language&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#xml-syntax-iii-whitespace-language&#34;&gt;
	XML Syntax III: Whitespace, Language
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2000/11/xml-grundlagen.008.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitespace (Tab, LF, CR und Space) ist normalerweise ohne Bedeutung.
In besonderen Fällen ist jedoch mehr Kontrolle notwendig.
Das Spezialattribut &lt;code&gt;xml:space&lt;/code&gt; kann &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; oder &lt;code&gt;preserve&lt;/code&gt; angeben und wirkt auf den Text im Element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-xml&#34; data-lang=&#34;xml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;beispiel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;xml:space=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;preserve&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;       Besonders     kompliziert.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/beispiel&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weiterhin definiert das Attribut &lt;code&gt;xml:lang&lt;/code&gt; die Sprache eines Elementes.
Zugelassen sind ISO 639 LC, IETF RFC 1766 LC, ISO 3316 CC, ISO 639 LC-CC, I-&lt;languagecode&gt;, X-&lt;anything&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-xml&#34; data-lang=&#34;xml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;beispiel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;xml:lang=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;x-klingon&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;xml-syntax-iv-pis-comments&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#xml-syntax-iv-pis-comments&#34;&gt;
	XML Syntax IV: PIs, Comments
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dannn gibt es noch Processing Instructions (vgl. PHP) und Kommentare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-xml&#34; data-lang=&#34;xml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=&amp;#34;1.0&amp;#34; ?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;?xml-stylesheet ?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;?php echo &amp;#34;Keks&amp;#34;; ?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Kommentar --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kommentare können kein &lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt; enthalten, und kein trailing &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;, können nicht geschachtelt werden und nicht in Attributen oder Tags stehen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;ein-beispiel&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#ein-beispiel&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Die PI deklariert XML-Version, und bestimmt so das Kompatibilitätsverhalten des Parsers und deklariert den Zeichensatz (damit wir Umlaute verwenden dürfen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Form ist klassisch: Pluralisierter Name der Elemente zeigt einen Container an. &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;books/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; kann Dinge vom Typ &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;book/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; enthalten. Die Eigenschaften eines Buches werden hier als Elemente definiert. Sie könnten auch Attribute sein (nicht für &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;categories/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, denn Attribute dürfen sich nicht wiederholen).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DTDs bestimmen, welche Elemente im Dokument vorkommen dürfen, wie sie geschachtelt werden und wie sie wiederholt werden können. Genauso werden Attribute Elementen zugeordnet, mit Defaults und erlaubten Werten versehen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In jedem Fall ist XML auch ohne DTD syntaktisch korrekt, wenn es korrekt geschachtelt ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;dtds-am-beispiel-entities-elemente&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DTDs werden aus Entities zusammengesetzt, diese werden literal hin geschreben, oder aus Daten gelesen oder kommen sonstwo her.
Es gibt ein paar Konstrukte, die an die Bausteine und Notation von EBNF erinnern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will man XML verwenden, um ein Datentauschformat zwischen Geschäften zu definieren, muß man meist Daten modellieren.
Diese Modelle liegen oft als ER-Modell vor.
Die Constraints in DTDs sind aber zu schwach, um das zu leisten, was an Constraints in ER-Modellen verwendet wird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dazu kommt, daß XML mehrere verschiedene Wege bietet, um Dinge zu modellieren:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Als Elementhierarchie&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mit Attributen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elementhierarchien erlauben komplexe Strukturen, freie Reihenfolgen, sind schachelbar, aber sie sind auch kompliziert anzusprechen und brauchen viel Platz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attribute erlauben Wertlisten, und Defaults, erlauben mit ID und IDREF Queryverweise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Einheiten codieren&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img border=&amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, discouraged für SGML Kompatibilität&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binäre Daten&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NOTATION ist unflexibel, BASE64 empfohlen, XLink wird es richten.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saubere Umsetzung von ER-Modellen in XML Schemata ist derzeit nicht möglich. Der XML Schema Standard wird DTDs ersetzen und vieles einfacher machen. DTDs und Namespaces funktionieren auch nicht!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;document-object-model-xml-bäume&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#document-object-model-xml-b%c3%a4ume&#34;&gt;
	Document Object Model: XML Bäume
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-xml&#34; data-lang=&#34;xml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;book&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;author&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Michael Kay&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/author&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;XSLT&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;preis&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;   &lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;wä&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;hrung=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;usd&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;     34.99
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/preis&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/book&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dokument als DOM-API Baum repräsentiert&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API erlaubt Suchen, Erzeugen, Löschen von Knoten&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAX-API repräsentiert das Dokument nicht, sondern liefert Parse-Events&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Streaming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;xml-namespaces-erläuterung&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#xml-namespaces-erl%c3%a4uterung&#34;&gt;
	XML Namespaces (Erläuterung)
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2000/11/xml-grundlagen.017.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beim Mischen zweiter DTDs in einem Dokument kann es zu Namenskollisionen kommen, doppelte Elementnamen, Attribute sollen global verwendbar sein.
Die Idee, jedes Element mit der URL seiner DTD zu prefixen ist zu umständlich.
Feste Namen gehen auch nicht, da dann auch wieder Kollisionen möglich sind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;xml-namespaces-deklaration&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#xml-namespaces-deklaration&#34;&gt;
	XML Namespaces (Deklaration)
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2000/11/xml-grundlagen.018.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daher deklariert man Namespaces, indem man für die URL der DTD einen lokalen Kurznamen definiert und den dann als Prefix verwendet.
Dies geschieht mit &lt;code&gt;xmlns:kurzname=URL&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-xml&#34; data-lang=&#34;xml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;xsl:stylesheet&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;xmlns:xsl=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;version=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;1.0&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;	&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;xsl:include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;date.xsl&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;	&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;xsl:template&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;match=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;date&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;		&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;date&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;		&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;xsl:value-of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;select=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;$date&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;		&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/date&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;	&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/xsl:template&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/xsl:stylesheet&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schon das stylesheet-Element selbst kann das Prefix xsl verwenden. Innerhalb des Elementes kann das Prefix xsl ebenfalls verwendet werden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;xslt&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#xslt&#34;&gt;
	XSLT
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2000/11/xml-grundlagen.019.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XML-Quelldokument und XSLT-Stylesheet werden als Baum dargestellt.
Die Transformationsregeln des Stylesheet matchen dann ähnlich AWK auf Elemente vom Quellbaum, und generieren den Resultatbaum.
Am Ende wird der Resultatbaum ausgegeben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-xml&#34; data-lang=&#34;xml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;xsl:template&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;match=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;book&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;xsl:value-of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;select=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;.&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/xsl:template&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baumwurzel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-xml&#34; data-lang=&#34;xml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;xsl:template&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;match=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;/&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Bla&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&amp;lt;xsl:apply-templates/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/xsl:template&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;xslstylesheet-element&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#xslstylesheet-element&#34;&gt;
	xsl:stylesheet Element
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2000/11/xml-grundlagen.020.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das &lt;code&gt;xsl:stylesheet&lt;/code&gt; Element definiert die Version des Stylesheet, kann spezielle Erweiterungen aktivieren, und kann das Stylesheet benennen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In einem XML-Dokument kann mit dem &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?xml-stylesheet ?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; dem XML ein Stylesheet zugeordnet werden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;embedded-stylesheet&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#embedded-stylesheet&#34;&gt;
	Embedded Stylesheet
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2000/11/xml-grundlagen.021.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eine Mischform existiert, sie vermischt aber unangenehm Daten und Format. Nicht empfehlenswert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;vereinfachte-stylesheets&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#vereinfachte-stylesheets&#34;&gt;
	Vereinfachte Stylesheets
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2000/11/xml-grundlagen.022.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;whitespace-handling&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#whitespace-handling&#34;&gt;
	Whitespace Handling
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2000/11/xml-grundlagen.023.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XML-Bäume enthalten kein Whitespace.
Whitespace in Nodes mit &lt;code&gt;#PCDATA&lt;/code&gt; ist signifikant.
Zeilenenden werden normalisiert.
Nodes mit Whitespace-Only können gelöscht werden.
Overrides existieren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;xpath-achsen&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#xpath-achsen&#34;&gt;
	XPath: Achsen
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2000/11/xml-grundlagen.024.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Um Elemente zu finden und zu selektieren, definiert XPath Suchausdrücke.
Sie suchen im Dokument entlang von &amp;ldquo;Achsen&amp;rdquo;.
Für die wichtigsten Achsen gibt es Kurzschreibweisen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Einige XPath Achsen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;child: Kinder der aktuellen node (descendant).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;parent: Elternelement, so vorhanden (ancestor).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;following/preceding: Der aktuellen node folgende/vorangehende Elemente.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;attribute/namespace: Attribute/Namespace-nodes des aktuellen Elements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;xpath-mehr-über-achsen&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#xpath-mehr-%c3%bcber-achsen&#34;&gt;
	XPath: Mehr über Achsen
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2000/11/xml-grundlagen.025.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achsen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ancestor, ancestor-or-self&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;attribute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;child, descendant, descendant-or-self&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;following, following-sibling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;namespace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;parent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;preceding, preceding-sibling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;self&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;xpath-node-tests&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#xpath-node-tests&#34;&gt;
	XPath: Node Tests
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2000/11/xml-grundlagen.026.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der etwas seltsam klingende Name &amp;ldquo;Node Test&amp;rdquo; bezieht sich auf einen Ausdruck, der ausgehend vom aktueellen Knoten weitere Elemente auswählt.
Das Resultat ist ein Node Set, also kein Baum.
XPath ist damit keine Algebra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dennoch kann man weitere Prädikate auf den Node Set anwenden und weiter filtern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;xpath-kurzschreibweisen&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#xpath-kurzschreibweisen&#34;&gt;
	XPath: Kurzschreibweisen
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2000/11/xml-grundlagen.027.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein Haufen Kurzschreibweisen existieren, damit man XPath-Ausdrücke ohne kilometerlange Achsennamen schreiben kann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;xpath-mehr-kurzschreibweisen&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#xpath-mehr-kurzschreibweisen&#34;&gt;
	XPath: Mehr Kurzschreibweisen
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2000/11/xml-grundlagen.028.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es braucht etwas Übung, bis die Syntax von der Hand geht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;xpath-core-function-library&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#xpath-core-function-library&#34;&gt;
	XPath: Core Function Library
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2000/11/xml-grundlagen.029.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dazu kommmt ein sehr begrenzter Satz Funktionen, die man auf Knoten oder Knotenmengen anwenden kann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;xslt-und-xpath&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#xslt-und-xpath&#34;&gt;
	XSLT und XPath
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2000/11/xml-grundlagen.030.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XSLT und XPath zusammen können dann verwendet werden, um Daten aus einem Quell-XML Dokument zu extrahieren und in ein Zieldokument einzusetzen.&lt;/p&gt;

, ist ein Internet Systemhaus in Kiel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gegründet 1992, war die Firma ursprünglich als Internet Service Provider tätig.
Heute werden die Geschäftsfelder ISP-Geschäft, Consulting, Hard- und Softwarehandel, Service und Support sowie Anwendungsentwicklung abgedeckt.
NetUSE hat derzeit etwa 60 Mitarbeiter und wächst schnell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hacken&amp;rdquo; einer Website ist ein Angriff auf Verfügbarkeit, Integrität oder Vertraulichkeit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hacker&amp;rdquo; vs. &amp;ldquo;Cracker&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ursprünglich bezeichnete das Wort &amp;ldquo;Hacker&amp;rdquo; einen Menschen, der ein Programm oder eine Maschine dazu bringen konnte, irgendetwas Unerwartetes oder Geniales zu tun.
Jemand, der in Rechner einbricht oder Kopierschutze entfernt, war dagegen ein &amp;ldquo;Cracker&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Medien haben jedoch entschieden und verwenden die Bezeichnung &amp;ldquo;Hacker&amp;rdquo; im Wortsinn der Bezeichnung &amp;ldquo;Cracker&amp;rdquo;.
Dies ist nicht mehr zu ändern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zwei große Gruppen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Script Kiddies&amp;rdquo;, Angreifer ohne Insiderwissen und ohne tiefergehende Ausbildung, verwenden meist vorgefertigte Angriffswerkzeuge. Greifen ungerichtet an (Scanning) und brechen in eine große Zahl von Systemen ein.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Insider&amp;rdquo;, (Ex-)Mitarbeiter et. al. Teilweise weitgehendes Wissen über Infrastruktur, verwendet Systemtools, Angriffswerkzeuge und selbstgeschriebene, maßgeschneiderte Programme (&amp;ldquo;Das Einbruchswerkzeug sitzt zwischen den Ohren&amp;rdquo;).  Will gezielt an bestimmte Netzwerkressourcen herankommen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Script Kiddies&amp;rdquo; oder &amp;ldquo;Spielkinder&amp;rdquo; sind eigentlich kein neues Phänomen.
Neu ist lediglich, daß eine so große Anzahl von Werkzeugen existiert, die es Spielkindern so leicht macht, ihren Neigungen nachzugehen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spielkinder sollten für den Administrator einer Site eigentlich kein Problem sein, ihre Methoden und Werkzeuge sind beschrieben in&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insider sind ein wesentlich schwierigeres Problem und nur durch ein durchgehendes Sicherheitskonzept zu bekämpfen, das von dem betreffenden Betrieb auch gelebt werden muß.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Script Kiddies&amp;rdquo;: Warez-Site, IRC &amp;ldquo;Trading-Bots&amp;rdquo;, Bandbreite, Paßworte als Handelsware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Insider&amp;rdquo;: Rache, spezifische Informationen aus dem Intranetwork, Kundenstammdaten, Kundenverkehrsdaten&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Script Kiddies&amp;rdquo; sind auf der Suche nach Umschlagplätzen für &amp;ldquo;Warez&amp;rdquo;, d.h. für geknackte Raubkopien von Programmen, Musik-CDs und Spielfilmen.
Sie stehen über eine Reihe von unterschiedlichen Kommunikationssystemen miteinander in Verbindung und benötigen für ihr Geschäft massenhaft Plattenplatz, Netzbandbreite und Kommunikationsplattformen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schlecht geschützte und unzureichend gepflegte Rechner sind ihre bevorzugte Beute.
Sie finden diese Maschinen, indem sie mit Hilfe von &amp;ldquo;vulnerability scannern&amp;rdquo; ein Netzwerksegment nach Programmen mit bekannten Fehlern absuchen und dann halb- oder vollautomatisch in diese Maschinen einbrechen.
Der Automat trägt in der Regel einen gescripteten Angriff binnen weniger Sekunden vor und installiert einen Satz von modifizierten Systemwerkzeugen, ein sogenanntes &amp;ldquo;root kit&amp;rdquo;, das den Einbruch vertuscht und den verbrauchten Plattenplatz sowie die Prozesse des Einbrechers vor dem Sysadmin verbirgt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insider gehen dagegen meist gegen einen bestimmten Rechner im Netz vor, von dem sie spezifische Daten (Mails, Kundenstammdaten, Protokolle) haben möchten, oder dessen Betrieb sie sabotieren möchten.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2000/08/web-security.005.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netzwerkkomponenten: Router, Firewalls, Switches&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ziel: Angriffsquelle verschleiern, Stepping Stone, Netzwerktopologie ermitteln, Netzwerkverkehr belauschen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Server (eigentliches Ziel): Server-Betriebssystem, Webserver, Webanwendung&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ziel: Zugang zum Server-Betriebssystem, Zugang zu den Zieldaten&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angriffe erfolgen in den meisten Fällen auf Server, nicht auf Netzwerkkomponenten:
Wissen um Betriebssysteme und Fehler von Servern ist in den relevanten Kreisen meist wesentlich weiter verbreitet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angriffe auf Netzwerkkomponenten erfolgen fast niemals durch Script Kiddies (Ausnahme sind bestimmte Distributed Denial Of Service-Angriffe), sondern fast immer als Teil eines geplanten Angriffes mit Insiderwissen und durch besser ausgebildete Angreifer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auf dem Server können Angriffe dem Serverbetriebssystem, dem installierten Webserver oder der Webanwendung selbst gelten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kompromittierte Netzwerkkomponente:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Angreifer hat detaillierte Information über die Topologie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Angreifer kann Routing beeinflussen und IP-Adressen spoofen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Angreifer kann unverschlüsselten Datenverkehr abhören.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transitivität!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kompromittierter Server:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Angreifer hat Zugriff auf Daten und Geheimnisse auf dem Server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Angreifer hat die Systeminstallation kompromittiert (&amp;ldquo;Der Server lügt&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Angreifer kann unverschlüsselten Datenverkehr abhören.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transitivität!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es ist davon auszugehen, daß Betriebssystem und Anwendungen auf einem kompromittierten Rechner so verändert sind, daß sie den Administrator belügen.
Der Rechner kann nicht wiederhergestellt werden, er muss neu installiert werden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zur Sicherung der Beweismittel gelten die folgenden Regeln:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alle Platten aus dem betreffenden Rechner ausbauen und niemals wieder mounten. Ein Mount würde access times an Dateien oder wichtigeres zerstören und das Medium als Beweismittel unbrauchbar machen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Die betreffenden Platten können in eine andere Maschine eingebaut, um mit dd Images zu generieren (&lt;code&gt;dd if=/dev/hdc of=/export/disk2/imagefile&lt;/code&gt;). Weitere Analysen finden nur auf den Images statt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transitivität ist ein Problem:
Kompromittierte Rechner sind Sprungbretter für ein weiteres Eindringen in das gehackte Netz oder für Angriffe auf andere Netzwerke:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paßworte können mit Sniffern ausgespäht worden sein.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Andere Administratoren in anderen Netzen müssen informiert werden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gehackt ist nie ein einzelner Rechner, sondern immer mindestens ein Subnetz!
Aufräumen und Validierung bringt enorme Kosten!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Betriebssystem: Der Server bietet Dienste an, die er nicht anbieten muß/sollte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webserver: Der Server liefert Daten im Web, die dort nicht stehen müssen/sollten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webanwendung: Der Server glaubt Daten, die nicht aus vertrauenswürdigen Quellen stammen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Server bietet Dienste an:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zugriff auf NFS Fileshares von überall (FH Lüneburg)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zugriff auf Datenbank von überall (Buchhandel.de)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zugriff auf RPC-Dienste (Sony Music.de)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Server liefert Dateien:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logfile des Webshops mit Kunden- und CC-Daten (diverse)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Images mit Auflösung (Survivor TV Show)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Server glaubt Daten:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preisinfo als Zustand beim Anwender gehalten (verschiedene Videoläden)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Session-IDs dicht besetzt (ein anderer Buchladen)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pfadnamen als URL-Parameter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angriffe auf einen Webserver lassen sich in drei Problemklassen einteilen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Angriffe auf das Betriebssystem. Bei dieser Sorte Angriff werden bekannte Schwächen in Diensten ausgenutzt, die das Betriebssystem standardmäßig anbietet.
Dies setzt voraus, daß das Betriebssystem diesen Dienst überhaupt anbietet.
Dienste, die nicht eingeschaltet sind, können über das Netz nicht für einen remoten Angriff genutzt werden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Angriffe, die darauf abzielen, bestimmte Logdaten oder andere Informationen zu beziehen, die der Webserver anbietet (aber nicht anbieten sollte).
Diese Angriffe sind spezifisch für Webserver und Webanwendungen, meist sind sie nur bei schlechten Defaultkonfigurationen in Zusammenhang mit schlampigem Setup möglich.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Angriffe, die spezifisch auf die eingesetzte Webanwendung abzielen und die sich schlechte Programmiergewohnheiten der Entwickler zunutze machen.
Viele Webanwendungen gehen davon aus, daß ein Client/Browser vertrauenswürdig ist und nicht manipulierte Daten liefert. Diese Annahme ist im Allgemeinen falsch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;problem-1-ein-server-bietet-zuviele-dienste-an&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#problem-1-ein-server-bietet-zuviele-dienste-an&#34;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2000/08/web-security.008.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warum?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standardinstallation des Herstellers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installationszugänge für Produktion nicht abgeschaltet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defaultuser/Zugänge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wartungszugänge allgemein aufrufbar (kein Extranet-Konzept).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fehlendes Betreiber-Knowhow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standardinstallation:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimiert für Intranets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimiert für einfache Handhabung.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fehlende Patches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defaultuser: &amp;ldquo;sa&amp;rdquo;/&amp;quot;&amp;quot;, &amp;ldquo;system&amp;rdquo;/&amp;ldquo;manager&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;scott&amp;rdquo;/&amp;ldquo;tiger&amp;rdquo;, &amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kein Extranet-Konzept:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wartungszugänge nur verschlüsselt (ssh, SSL, VPN).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keine Wege aus der Produktion ins Intranet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Für den sicheren Betrieb von Servern gilt generell, daß ein Rollout- und Pflegekonzept vorhanden sein muss.
Dies klingt selbstverständlich, ist es aber nicht:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Werden Systeminstallationen industriell gefertigt?
Installserver erlauben reproduzierbare Installationen, Versionierung von Installationen und den systematischen Test einer Installation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Werden Systemupdates industriell durchgeführt?
Test- und Verteilkonzepte für die Software auf Servern in der Produktion müssen existieren, damit Fehlerkorrekturen und Upgrades schnell und sicher verteilt werden können.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breakeven-Point ist klein, schon ab 5 identischen Installationen rentiert sich das Knowhow und der Aufwand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oft werden Extranet-Kontakte mit unstrukturierten Kontakten mit Laufkundschaft gleichgesetzt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verbindungen sind nicht auf bestimmte Teilnetze beschränkt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verbindungen sind nicht verschlüsselt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verbindungen sind nicht gut authentisiert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derartige &amp;ldquo;offene&amp;rdquo; Extranet-Kontakte sind ein beliebtes Einfallstor in Produktionsnetze von Firmen.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;rdquo; am 30. August 2000:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unverschlüsselte Systemzugänge mit ftp, obwohl ssh eingesetzt werden könnte.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;53/tcp ist offen für alle, statt nur für Secondary Server zugreifbar zu sein.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;111/tcp ist weit offen und erlaubt den Angriff auf RPC-Dienste.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;515/tcp läuft vollkommen sinnlos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3306/tcp erlaubt Zugriff auf eine Datenbank.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;199/tcp führt auf eine Bash mit root-Rechten:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Die Maschine wurde bereits gehackt und mit einem Rootkit versehen. Für den Administrator sind über die Backdoor eingeloggte Benutzer nicht in der Prozeßliste und der Speicherstatistik zu sehen, der von ihnen verbrauchte Plattenplatz wird versteckt. Die Maschine lauscht auf ihrem Netzwerksegment nach Klartext-Paßworten für andere Maschinen, nur ein Switch hat schlimmeres verhindert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ipchains waren auf der Maschine installiert, aber nicht in Betrieb.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 Tage nach Neuinstallation wurde die Maschine wieder gehackt (RedHat mit wuftpd 2.6.0 als Einfallstor).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notwendig sind meist nur zwei Dienste:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domain Name System, aber nur outgoing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTTP/HTTPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zur Wartung oft weitere Dienste:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FTP -&amp;gt; besser: ssh, scp, rsync&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;telnet/rlogin -&amp;gt; besser: ssh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;POP/IMAP -&amp;gt; besser: S/POP, S/IMAP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zum Intranet oft weitere Dienste:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Datenbank/LDAP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rlogin/rcp, FTP/TELNET -&amp;gt; besser: ssh/scp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drei goldene Regeln:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimiere die angebotenen Dienste.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schränke nichtöffentliche Dienste über IP-Number so weit wie möglich ein.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Übertrage keine Paßworte im Klartext!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Und nicht vergessen, die wichtigste Regel überhaupt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lies die einschlägigen Securityforen.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bugtraq, NT-Bugtraq, Securityfocus.com und andere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktualisiere Deine Installationen regelmäßig.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Letzterer Punkt setzt voraus: Ein Betriebskonzept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Welche Software in welcher Version läuft wo?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wie bekommen wir Updates auf diese Maschinen, ohne den Betrieb zu unterbrechen?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wie bekommen wir gleichartig installierte neue Maschinen? (Installserver).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 2000 Advanced Server läßt gerne seinen Active Directory Dienst über den LDAP-Port offen zugänglich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ldapsearch -h &amp;lt;ip&amp;gt; -b &amp;quot;&amp;quot; -s base &amp;quot;objectclass=*&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; liefert eine Reihe von Naming Contexts. Diese kann man dann der Reihe nach durchprobieren.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ldapsearch -h &amp;lt;ip&amp;gt; -b &amp;quot;&amp;lt;context&amp;gt;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;objectclass=*&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; erlaubt es sich, den entsprechenden Kontext anzusehen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Unix wird dagegen gerne der Portmapper offengelassen, der gleich eine ganze Reihe von unzureichend geschützten Diensten erschließt.
Fehler sind in der Vergangenheit im Portmapper selbst sowie in vielen Diensten aufgetreten.
NFS ist sowieso ein Sicherheitsrisiko und sollte von außen nicht erreichbar sein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noch einmal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kein Kontakt zum Internet ohne Firewall.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wenigstens ein Paketfilter sollte vorhanden sein, damit auch bei schlampiger Konfiguration im Produktionsnetz nur die intendierten Dienste nach außen sichtbar sind. Verdächtige Pakete sollten gleich gefiltert werden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keine Ausnahmen während der Installation. (Auch nicht für Slashdot).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slashdot.org-Hack: Testmaschine mit Defaultpaßworten (Fehlerklasse 1 == nicht intendierte Dienste öffentlich angeboten) plus &amp;ldquo;eval-Bug&amp;rdquo; (Fehlerklasse 3 == Anwendung vertraut Daten aus dem Netz).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bedeutung &amp;ldquo;Trust Boundary&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Systeme/Datenquellen innerhalb werden durch unsere Administration kontrolliert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sie liefern daher vertrauenswürde Daten.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Umkehrung darf niemals vergessen werden!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Systeme/Datenquellen außerhalb der Boundary sind unkontrollierbar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sie liefern daher &lt;strong&gt;verseuchte&lt;/strong&gt; Daten.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diese Daten müssen vor Gebrauch unbedingt &lt;strong&gt;dekontaminiert&lt;/strong&gt; werden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sie dürfen die Boundary danach niemals wieder nach draußen verlassen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust Boundaries arbeiten in zwei Richtungen.
Dieser Vortrag betrachtet hauptsächlich den Datenstrom &amp;ldquo;von außen nach innen&amp;rdquo;, aber auch der Datenstrom &amp;ldquo;von innen nach außen&amp;rdquo; ist wichtig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authensierung des Servers durch Serverzertifikat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verhinderung von Informationslecks durch Informationen im Referer (Nicht wirklich ein Datenstrom &amp;ldquo;von innen nach außen&amp;rdquo;, aber in der Verantwortung des Anwendungsprogrammierers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anwendungen müssen alle Daten &amp;ldquo;von außen nach innen&amp;rdquo; prüfen und dann &amp;ldquo;drinnen&amp;rdquo; behalten:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sessions! Niemals HIDDEN-Parameter!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daten von &amp;ldquo;außen&amp;rdquo;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alle GET-, POST- und COOKIE-Variablen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alle HTTP_*-Variablen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alle File-Uploads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schleichende Einschleppung durch
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unzureichende Validierung (-&amp;gt; OOH Forms)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;register_globals = On&lt;/code&gt; (-&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;register_globals = off&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typische Fehler:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anwenderdaten werden durch HIDDEN-Parameter oder per GET/POST/COOKIE weitergereicht.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anwendung vertraut Daten aus dem Request in sicherheitsrelevanten Fragen:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Referer, User-Agent, IP-Nummer, &amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anwendung validiert Anwendungsdaten nur mit JS.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na und? Ich habe kein JS, ich sende mit &amp;ldquo;telnet&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anwendung validiert Anwendungsdaten nicht.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wie kann ich Formularvariablen bei einer Session registrieren?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wie kann ich ein SQL-Statement von Seite zu Seite weiterreichen?&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cf. Stored Procedures im MS-SQL Server wie sp_system().&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abhilfe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anwendung validiert Daten serverside, mit einem geprüften Satz von Funktionen/Klassen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nur validierte Daten werden Bestandteil der Session.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nur Sessiondaten werden verarbeitet, GPC- und Request-Informationen werden niemals verwendet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2000/08/web-security.018.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Der 3. Kardinalfehler ist sehr häufig. Warum?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTTP ist ein zustands-loses Protokoll.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Webanwendungen brauchen Zustand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Viele Umgebungen bieten keine adäquate Unterstützung für Statekeeping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Viele Entwickler stricken sich &amp;ldquo;halbe&amp;rdquo; Lösungen selbst.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warum Sessions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dem Anwender steht nur ein einzelnes Token zur Referenzierung des Sessiondatensatzes zur Verfügung.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Klare Fehlersemantik: Sessiondaten sind entweder komplett und vertrauenswürdig, oder gar nicht vorhanden (-&amp;gt; neue Session).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Klarer Datenfluß (GPC/HTTP-Daten -&amp;gt; Validierung -&amp;gt; Session -&amp;gt; Anwendung), Umgehung der Validierung ist nicht möglich.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Viel Code wird einfacher, da die Anwendung sich nun &amp;ldquo;erinnern&amp;rdquo; kann.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anwendungsstruktur wird klarer.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saubere Trennung von &amp;ldquo;statekeeping&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;authentication&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;authorization&amp;rdquo;, wie sie in PHPLIB durchgeführt wird.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infrastruktur (&amp;ldquo;Sessions&amp;rdquo;) wird wiederverwendet, daher besser geprüfter und wiederverwendbarer Code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wichtig: Token darf nicht ratbar (&amp;ldquo;17&amp;rdquo;) sein.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$id = md5(uniqid(&amp;ldquo;geheim&amp;rdquo;));&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;oder eine Zufallszahl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andere Gründe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aus Zeitdruck Prototypen in Produktion geben.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rapid Prototyping ersetzt keine Designphase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Es ergänzt die Analysephase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Datei-Struktur der Anwendung vs. Datenfluß&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An welcher Stelle übernimmt die Webanwendung Benutzerdaten?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was passiert, wenn man ihr an anderen Stellen Daten übergibt?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was passiert, wenn der Anwender URLs wahllos aufruft?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eingabevalidierung ist mühsam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Findet an allen Stellen Eingabevalidierung statt?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ist diese vollständig?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Struktur in der Anwendung kommt nur durch Struktur im Entwicklungsprozeß.
Hemmungslose Kaufempfehlung:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Web Application Programming&amp;rdquo;, Gerken/Ratschiller, New Riders&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statekeeping durch Application Server managen lassen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anwendung als Automaten strukturieren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automaten lassen sich gut formal verifizieren.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eingaben zentral prüfen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application Server sollte Bibliothek zum Formularmanagement haben.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Datentypen strikt prüfen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eigentlich überflüssig, aber immer wieder gesehen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pfadnamen oder gar Code haben in Parametern nichts zu suchen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entgegen der populären Volksmeinung sind viele Methoden aus der Mathematik und dem Informatikstudium sehr hilfreich bei der Entwicklung von Webanwendungen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anwendung als Code + State modellieren.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formales Datenmodell, formales Datenbankmodell, formales Angreifermodell, formales Sicherheitsmodell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatentheorie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyse- und Designmethoden zur Identifikation wiederverwendbarer Komponenten und zur Findung von Bibliotheks-APIs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;projektbegleitender Code Review, Post Deployment Projektanalyse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webprojekte unterscheiden sich nicht von normaler Anwendungsentwicklung, sie sehen nur auf den ersten Blick anders aus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;weit mehr als 80% aller LOC sind PHP, nicht HTML.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Das fremdartige Aussehen rührt weitgehend aus dem Fehlen angemessener Werkzeuge und Bibliotheken her.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PHP3 pur ist für die Anwendungsentwicklung im Web nicht angemessen.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fehlendes Statekeeping, fehlende Eingabevalidierung&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;-&amp;gt; PHPLIB!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2000/05/01/webserver-security.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;aus: iX 5/2000.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;webserver-security&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#webserver-security&#34;&gt;
	Webserver Security
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In den vergangenen Monaten haben Zeitschriften des Heise-Verlages immer wieder über Sicherheitslöcher in Installationen bekannter Serverbetreiber oder Webhoster berichtet.
Offensichtlich existieren tausende von Webanwendungen, die mit heißer Nadel gestrickt und online gebracht worden sind und die - wenn überhaupt - nur unzulänglich getestet worden sind.
Was ist die Ursache der beobachteten Probleme und wie kann man sie für seinen eigenen Server vermeiden?
Kann man als Verbraucher und Benutzer erkennen, ob der Server eines Anbieters elementaren Qualitätsanforderungen an die Sicherheit im Web genügt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eine Analyse der gemeldeten Fehler zeigt, daß sich die weitaus meisten Probleme in nur drei Fehlerklassen einteilen lassen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Der Server bietet zu viele Dienste an.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Der Server lagert vertrauliche Daten in zugänglichen Verzeichnissen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Der Server vertraut Eingabeparametern aus Webformularen ohne Grund.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ein-server-bietet-zu-viele-dienste-an&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#ein-server-bietet-zu-viele-dienste-an&#34;&gt;
	Ein Server bietet zu viele Dienste an
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Häufig hat sich ein Betreiber einer Maschine seinen Server noch niemals mit einem der gängigen Portscanner von außen angesehen und läßt auf seinem Server Dienste laufen, die für die Benutzung der Anwendung nicht benötigt werden oder nicht von allen IP-Adressen aus zugänglich sein müssen.
Ein prominentes Beispiel der vergangenen Wochen, über das wir berichteten war ein Server, der vollständig ohne Firewall betrieben wurde und nach außen komplette Dateisysteme mit dem Sun Network Filesystem exportierte und dessen Oracle Server von jedermann kontaktiert werden konnte.
Praktischerweise fanden sich die für Oracle benötigten Paßworte auf den exportierten Netzwerklaufwerken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oft wird dieser Fehler mit der Verwendung unsicherer und abhörbarer Übertragungsprotokolle für Wartungszugänge kombiniert:
So findet man oft auf Webserver auch POP3-Zugänge zum Abruf von Bestellmails, FTP-Zugänge zum Upload von neuen Webseiten oder gar Datenbankzugänge zum Upload neuer Bestandsdaten.
Diese Protokolle bieten vielfach nur unzulängliche Verschlüsselung von Benutzernamen und Paßworten an, von einer Verschlüsselung der eigentlichen Nutzdaten ganz zu schweigen - der msql-Datenbankserver zum Beispiel bietet nur rudimentäre bis gar keine Sicherung des Zugangs an, FTP und POP3 übertragen Paßworte oft unverschlüsselt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein Webmaster ist gut beraten, sich einen Zugang außerhalb seines eigentlichen Providers und Webmasters zu besorgen und sich seinen eigenen Server einmal mit den Augen und Tools eines Angreifers anzusehen.
Oft ist es so, daß Dienste in der Default-Konfiguration der Servermaschine ab Werk enthalten sind, die vom Serverbetreiber nicht erkannt und nicht abgeschaltet worden sind.
Beliebte Fehlerquellen sind zum Beispiel Webserver auf Nichtstandardports, die die Handbücher des Systems anbieten.
Diese Server enthalten sehr oft fehlerhafte CGI-Scripte oder können auf andere Weise zum Sicherheitsrisiko werden.
Eine andere beliebte Fehlerquelle ist der SNMP-Dienst (Simple Network Management Protocol), der einem potenziellen Angreifer viele Informationen über das Zielsystem liefert.
Auch Dienste, die nur zur Erstinstallation benötigt wurden, werden oft vergessen und für den Wirkbetrieb nicht abgeschaltet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natürlich muß nicht nur der Webserver geschützt werden: Auch alle anderen Maschinen, die außerhalb der Firewall im Produktions-LAN stehen, müssen denselben Sicherheitslevel erfüllen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nmap-scan-httpwwwinsecureorgnmap&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#nmap-scan-httpwwwinsecureorgnmap&#34;&gt;

)
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# nmap -sS -T Agressive -p 1-10000 www.beispiel1.de| grep open

3306    open        tcp       mysql
4333    open        tcp       msql
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;beispiel1.de&lt;/code&gt;, eigentlich ein Web- und FTP-Server, bietet außerdem die Dienste ftp, ssh, smtp, sunrpc, nntp, mysql und msql an. Davon ist ssh, ein mit starker Kryptographie verschlüsselndes und authentisierendes Protokoll, unbedenklich. Die Protokolle httpd, ftp, smtp und nntp sind die eigentlichen Dienste des Servers und müssen angeboten werden. Solange ftp nur als FTP-Server für Anon-FTP eingesetzt wird, werden keine abhörbaren Paßworte übertragen. Die sunrpc, mysql und msql-Ports von außen zugänglich zu machen ist nicht nötig. Die Ports gehören in einer Firewall oder mit einen Paketfilter gesperrt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bei den Diensten, die man nach außen anbietet sollte man unbedingt auf aktuelle Versionen der Server achten: Buffer-Overflows und andere Probleme sind von ssh, von vielen FTP-Servern und auch von alten sendmail- und INN-Versionen bekannt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manchmal findet man einen offenen Port, kann aber nicht sagen, welches Programm diesen Port benutzt.
Hier ist ein Tool wie &lt;code&gt;lsof&lt;/code&gt; sehr nützlich.
Alle lokal offenen Ports und die dazugehörigen Programme kann man mit dem Kommando &lt;code&gt;lsof -P -n -i&lt;/code&gt; auflisten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# lsof -P -n -i

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Durch die Angabe von Suchoptionen kann man gezielt nach Protokoll und Port suchen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# lsof -P -n -i tcp:139
COMMAND   PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE NODE NAME
smbd      276 root    5u  IPv4    175       TCP *:139 (LISTEN)
smbd    11741 root    6u  IPv4  28689       TCP 193.102.57.3:139-&amp;gt;193.102.57.2:1044 (ESTABLISHED)

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Um festzustellen, welche Rechner in einer Domain stehen, kann man mit einem Tool wie nmap das ganze Teilnetz durchprüfen, in dem ein Server steht.
Alternativ kann man sich auch die Daten im DNS ansehen, die ein Serverbetreiber über seine Domain veröffentlicht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am Beispiel der Domain &lt;code&gt;beispiel1.de&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# nslookup

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Durch &lt;code&gt;set type=ns&lt;/code&gt; (Nameserver) sagen wir &lt;code&gt;nslookup&lt;/code&gt;, daß wir ausschließlich Informationen über Nameserver einer Domain haben möchten.
Wir fragen dann mit &lt;code&gt;www.beispiel1.de.&lt;/code&gt; nach den Nameservern der Domain &lt;code&gt;beispiel1.de&lt;/code&gt;.
Dies ist nur ein einzelner Server, nämlich &lt;code&gt;ns.beispiel1.de&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir sagen nun mit Hilfe des Kommandos &lt;code&gt;server ns.beispiel1.de&lt;/code&gt;, daß &lt;code&gt;nslookup&lt;/code&gt; alle weiteren Fragen an diesen Server richten soll.
Mit Hilfe des Kommandos &lt;code&gt;ls beispiel1.de&lt;/code&gt; fordern wir ein Listing der gesamten Zone &lt;code&gt;beispiel1.de&lt;/code&gt; an.
Wir erhalten eine Liste aller Hostnamen und IP-Nummern, die der Betreiber der Domain &lt;code&gt;beispiel1.de&lt;/code&gt; veröffentlicht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besser konfigurierte Nameserver erlauben ab BIND8, Zonetransfers auf die Secondary-Server einer Domain einzuschränken.
&lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt;-Kommandos von anderen Hosts schlagen dann fehl.
Hat eine Domain mehrere Nameserver, ist es unter Umständen lohnend, diese nacheinander durchzuprobieren:
Vielfach ist der Primary Nameserver restriktiv konfiguriert, aber die Secondaries geben einem dennoch ein Listing der Zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sicherheitsbewußte Netzbetreiber setzen Nameserver für das Internet und ihr Intranet getrennt auf.
Schließlich braucht es niemanden zu interessieren, welche Rechner in den Büros einer Firma laufen und wie diese heißen.
Stattdessen ist vollkommen ausreichend, die Namen und Nummern der Rechner zu publizieren, die Dienste für die Öffentlichkeit bringen, also etwa der Web-, der Name- und der Mailserver einer Domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mit Hilfe des Gnome-Programmes Cheops bekommt man schnell einen graphischen Netzplan mit Rechnertypen und Verbindungen.
Das Programm kann auch eingesetzt werden, um Portscans von Rechnern durchzuführen, ist hier aber nicht so vielseitig wie nmap.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mit Hilfe des Netzwerkmonitors Ethereal ist die Analyse von Netzwerkpaketen möglich. Mit Hilfe der Stromverfolgung können dabei die Klartextpaßworte in Protokollen wie TELNET, FTP, POP3 und anderen sehr gut sichtbar gemacht werden.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mit Hilfe der Tools &lt;code&gt;rpcinfo&lt;/code&gt; und &lt;code&gt;showmount&lt;/code&gt; (Linux: auch &lt;code&gt;kshowmount&lt;/code&gt;) kann man abfragen, welche Dienste der &lt;code&gt;sunrpc&lt;/code&gt;-Dienst  erbringt.
Falls das SUN Network Filesystem (NFS) zu diesen Diensten gehört, kann man weiterfragen, welche Dateisysteme und für wen exportiert werden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# rpcinfo -p www.beispiel1.de
   program vers proto   port
    100000    4   tcp    111  portmapper
    100000    3   tcp    111  portmapper
    100000    2   tcp    111  portmapper
    100000    4   udp    111  portmapper
    100000    3   udp    111  portmapper
    100000    2   udp    111  portmapper
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wie man sieht, redet der &lt;code&gt;sunrpc&lt;/code&gt;-Dienst von &lt;code&gt;www.beispiel1.de&lt;/code&gt; mit externen Rechnern.
Das ist nicht notwendig und der Dienst kann blockiert werden, etwa durch eine Firewall oder durch Konfiguration entsprechender Filtermechanismen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eine sehr häufige Fehlkonfiguration besteht darin, Verzeichnisse mit NFS weltweit les- und schreibbar freizugeben.
Beispielhaft unsicher die Server von &lt;code&gt;beispiel2.de&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# /usr/sbin/kshowmount -e rzserv2.beispiel2.de
Export list for rzserv2.beispiel2.de:
/usr/lib/cobol       (everyone)
/usr/sys/inst.images (everyone)
/stadtinf            (everyone)
/var/spool/mail      (everyone)
/usr/lpp/info        (everyone)
/usr/local           (everyone)
/pd-software         (everyone)
/u1                  (everyone)
/user                (everyone)
/fix                 (everyone)
/u                   (everyone)
/ora                 rzws01
/install             (everyone)
/ora-client          192.168.252.20
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Die mit &lt;code&gt;everyone&lt;/code&gt; gelisteten Verzeichnisse, darunter die Mail und die Homeverzeichnisse der Benutzer, sind weltweit les- und schreibbar.
Durch Zugriffe auf die &lt;code&gt;/usr/local&lt;/code&gt; und &lt;code&gt;/usr/lib/cobol&lt;/code&gt;-Verzeichnisse lassen sich Systembibiotheken und Systemprogramme austauschen, sodaß das ganze System ohne nennenswerten Widerstand sofort einnehmbar ist.
Tauscht man Daten im &lt;code&gt;/install&lt;/code&gt;-Verzeichnis aus, sind auch alle Clients subvertiert, die von dieser Maschine installiert werden.
Das System ist durch seine fahrlässig offene Konfiguration also die ideale Ausgangsbasis für weitere Angriffe gegen andere Netzwerke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;snmp-abfragen-an-ein-entferntes-system&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#snmp-abfragen-an-ein-entferntes-system&#34;&gt;
	SNMP-Abfragen an ein entferntes System
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SNMP gehört zu den Diensten, die einem Angreifer ein Höchstmaß an Information liefern können und die in Standardinstallationen oft nicht abgeschaltet und unzureichend gesichert werden.
Zudem läuft der Dienst über UDP, das von vielen Portscannern nicht per Default gescannt wird.
Daher taucht der Dienst auf dem Radar vieler Systemadministratoren nicht auf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wieder dienen die Server von &lt;code&gt;beispiel2.de&lt;/code&gt; als abschreckendes Beispiel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# snmpwalk rzserv2.beispiel2.de public
system.sysDescr.0 = OCTET STRING: &amp;#34;Fore Systems ATM Host (AIX 1 000005016600)&amp;#34;
system.sysObjectID.0 = OBJECT IDENTIFIER: enterprises.326.2.1
system.sysUpTime.0 = Timeticks: (0) 0:00:00
system.sysContact.0 = OCTET STRING: &amp;#34;&amp;#34;
system.sysName.0 = OCTET STRING: &amp;#34;rzserv2.&amp;#34;
system.sysLocation.0 = OCTET STRING: &amp;#34;&amp;#34;
system.sysServices.0 = INTEGER: 72
interfaces.ifNumber.0 = INTEGER: 7
interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifIndex.1 = INTEGER: 1
interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifIndex.2 = INTEGER: 2
interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifIndex.3 = INTEGER: 3
interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifIndex.4 = INTEGER: 4
interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifIndex.5 = INTEGER: 5
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wir erfahren hier nicht nur den Typ und Patchlevel des Systems, sondern (nicht gezeigt) auch eine Liste der Interfaces und Routingkonfiguration des Systems - wir bekommen also detaillierte Information über die Topologie des Zielnetzes.
Zusammen mit Daten aus dem DNS gibt uns das einen genauen Netzplan des potentiellen Opfers.
Wenn weitere Management Module installiert sind, bekommen Zugriff auf weitere Subsysteme, etwa Oracle, SAP oder andere fernzuüberwachende Einheiten.
SNMP wird auch in vielen Routern und in RMON Netzwerkprobes eingesetzt - ein Eindringling kann so sogar Verkehrsdaten aus dem Netz erfahren, wenn diese nicht gesichert worden sind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ein-server-lagert-vertrauliche-daten-in-zugänglichen-verzeichnissen&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#ein-server-lagert-vertrauliche-daten-in-zug%c3%a4nglichen-verzeichnissen&#34;&gt;
	Ein Server lagert vertrauliche Daten in zugänglichen Verzeichnissen
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eine weitere beliebte Fehlerklasse besteht in vertraulichen Daten, die in durch den Webserver zugänglichen Verzeichnissen gelagert werden.
Häufig bieten Webspace-Provider virtuelle Webserver an, bei denen die Wurzel des durch den Anwender beschreibbaren Bereiches (etwa: &lt;code&gt;/home/www/servers/www.kunde.de/&lt;/code&gt;, für den Kunden sichtbar als &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;) auch die Wurzel des virtuellen Servers ist (etwa: &lt;code&gt;http://www.kunde.de/&lt;/code&gt;).
Legt der Kunde jetzt Daten unterhalb seines Wurzelverzeichnisses ab (etwa eine Datei &lt;code&gt;/passwd&lt;/code&gt;) dann ist diese Datei auch durch den Webserver abrufbar, denn sie liegt ja unterhalb der Document Root und hat eine URL (etwa: &lt;code&gt;http://www.kunde.de/passwd&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viele Webshops schreiben Bestellungen in ein oder mehrere Logverzeichnisse oder haben Konfigurationsdateien mit Paßworten und Artikeldaten.
Liegen diese Daten unterhalb der Document Root, dann haben sie URLs und sind zunächst einmal prinzipiell über das Web abrufbar, sofern es einem Angreifer gelingt den Namen zu raten.
Kennt man den Namen und die Version der verwendeten Websoftware, ist dies meist sehr einfach zu machen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prinzipielle Abhilfe schaffen hier nur Hostingumgebungen, bei denen die Document Root des Webservers tiefer als die Wurzel des Kundenverzeichnisses liegt (etwa ab &lt;code&gt;/home/www/servers/www.kunde.de/pages&lt;/code&gt;).
Nun kann der Kunde weitere Verzeichnisse oberhalb der Document Root anlegen (etwa: &lt;code&gt;/home/www/servers/www.kunde.de/shop&lt;/code&gt;) und seine vertraulichen Daten dort speichern.
Da diese Verzeichnisse über das Wartungs-FTP, nicht aber mit HTTP zugänglich sind, können sie nicht so einfach abgerufen werden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternativ legt man Verzeichnisse unterhalb der Document Root an und verbietet den Zugriff per HTTP auf das Verzeichnis durch Anlegen einer &lt;code&gt;.htaccess&lt;/code&gt;-Datei (Apache-Webserver).
Die Datei sollte den Zugriff von überall verbieten:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cat /shop/.htaccess
order deny, allow
deny from all
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daten können dann nur noch über FTP abgerufen werden. Für FTP gelten &lt;code&gt;.htaccess&lt;/code&gt;-Dateien nicht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ein-server-vertraut-eingabeparametern-aus-webformularen-ohne-grund&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#ein-server-vertraut-eingabeparametern-aus-webformularen-ohne-grund&#34;&gt;
	Ein Server vertraut Eingabeparametern aus Webformularen ohne Grund
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die dritte häufige Fehlerklasse besteht darin, in CGI-Programmen Parameter aus dem Web zu übernehmen und ohne Prüfung zu verwenden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eine Webanwendung besteht aus Komponenten die innerhalb der Firewall liegen und als vertrauenswürdig gelten können, weil sie durch den lokalen Administrator kontrolliert werden.
Dazu gehören etwa die lokalen Scripte, die Datenbank, der Webserver und lokale Datendateien.
Dazu kommen dann weitere Komponenten, die außerhalb der Firewall liegen und die grundsätzlich als nicht vertrauenswürdig gelten können.
Das ist hauptsächlich der Browser des Anwenders, wenn er denn einen benutzt und seinen Webrequest zwecks Hackangriff nicht direkt in ein Telnet tippt.
Die Firewall markiert eine Vertrauensgrenze, eine Trust Boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daten von jenseits der Vertrauensgrenze kann eine Webanwendung nicht ohne Prüfung vertrauen.
Dazu gehören alle Parameter, die dem CGI-Script übergeben werden, also alle GET-, POST- oder COOKIE-Parameter, der HTTP_REFERER, der HTTP_USER_AGENT und alle weiteren Werte von außen.
Alle diese Werte müssen vor der Verwendung durch ein CGI-Script durch eine Gültigkeitsprüfung, in der sichergestellt wird, daß die Daten auch das erwartete Format haben und gültige Werte besitzen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zum Beispiel ist es gängige Praxis, daß bestimmte Scripte Werte nur dann akzeptieren, wenn bei der Übergabe der HTTP_REFERER des Aufrufes korrekt ist.
Auf diese Weise versucht sich das Script gegen gefälschte Aufrufe zu schützen.
Natürlich ist es für einen potentiellen Angreifer überhaupt gar kein Problem außer den Scriptparametern auch noch jeden gewünschten HTTP_REFERER mit zu übergeben - der Schutz ist also wirkungslos.
Korrekt wäre, wenn das Script jeden übergebenen Parametern einzeln prüft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eine andere häufig verwendete Technik besteht darin, Parameter von einer Seite zur nächsten als &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;INPUT TYPE=&amp;quot;HIDDEN&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; mitzuschleifen.
Dabei wird interner Zustand der Anwendung im Browser des Anwenders gehalten, also jenseits der Trust Boundary.
Für den Anwender ist es ein leichtes, den Zustand einer solchen Anwendung zu manipulieren und jeden gewünschten Effekt zu bewirken.
Korrekt wäre, eine Plattform zu verwenden, die Sessionvariablen bietet und den Zustand der Anwendung auf dem Webserver halten kann (etwa: Microsoft ASP mit dem Session-Objekt, PHP3 mit PHPLIB, PHP4 mit den
&lt;code&gt;session_*()&lt;/code&gt;-Funktionen oder einen richtigen Application-Server).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fazit&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#fazit&#34;&gt;
	Fazit
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webmaster sind gut beraten, alle ihre Installationen auf diese drei Fehlerklassen abzuprüfen und ihre Anwendungen gegebenenfalls anzupassen.
Gestohlene Kreditkartendaten oder gar geknackte Server, die als Ausgangspunkt für weitere Angriffe dienen, sind nicht nur peinlich:
Derartige Installationen sind fahrlässig unsicher und dem betroffenen Betreiber stehen mit großer Wahrscheinlichkeit Klagen auf Schadenersatz oder Beihilfe zum Computereinbruch ins Haus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Für den Laien ist dies keine Alternative:
Die Sicherheit eines Servers zu verifizieren setzt nicht nur umfassende technische Kenntnisse, sondern auch Zugang zum Server voraus.
Letztendlich kann nur ein technisches Gütesiegel, das auf Grundlage einer technischen Überprüfung der Server und aller darauf laufenden Anwendungen erteilt wird dem Verbraucher mitteilen, daß er es mit einer seriösen Installation zu tun hat.&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Apr 2000 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2000/04/14/neu-auf-einem-fremden-system.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dies ist eine aktualisierte Version der Schulung „Unix Systemsicherheit“, die ich vor einiger Zeit schon einmal gehalten habe.
Der Schwerpunkt dieser Schulung hat sich etwas zu den Grundlagen hin verschoben:
Es geht diesmal weniger um Unix Systemsicherheit als um die typische Situation der Consultants und Bereitschaften:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man kommt an eine neue Maschine und muss sich erst einmal zurechtfinden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;neu-auf-einem-fremden-system&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#neu-auf-einem-fremden-system&#34;&gt;
	Neu auf einem fremden System
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2000/04/neu-system-001.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orientierung:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typ und Ausstattung der Maschine
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prozessor, Festplatten, andere Hardware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speichersituation, historische und aktuelle Lastdaten&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Netzwerk und Netzwerkumfeld der Maschine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IP-Adressen, Routing
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Welche Name-Services in welcher Reihenfolge, welche Server werden verwendet?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was läuft, was soll laufen?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was ist installiert?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tatsächlich laufende Subsysteme vs. konfigurierte Subsysteme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir sind neu auf einem fremden System und loggen uns zum ersten Mal ein.
Wie können wir uns zurechtfinden? Was wollen wir überhaupt wissen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Maschine selbst ist nach Hardware, Speicher, Platten und Netzwerk zu beurteilen.
Die Netzwerkumgebung der Maschine ist einzuschätzen.
Die auf der Maschine installierten Systemdienste sind einzuschätzen und zu beurteilen.
Es muss ein Soll/Ist-Abgleich stattfinden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ausgehend von diesen Daten kann die Arbeit auf der Maschine beginnen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Maschine kann für ihre Aufgabe angepasst werden (Hardware- oder Softwareinstallation durch Consulting), bzw. die Fehlersuche kann beginnen (Alarmruf für die Bereitschaft).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was für Hardware ist das hier?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was ist in der Maschine eingebaut?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wie lange ist die Hardware schon &amp;ldquo;up&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erster Handgriff: &lt;code&gt;uname -a&lt;/code&gt;.
Weitere Aktionen systemspezfisch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linux: &lt;code&gt;lscpu&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;df -Th&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;lspci&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;lsusb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solaris: &lt;code&gt;prtconf -v&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;psrinfo -v&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/usr/platform/$(uname -m)/sbin/prtdiag&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uptime und Load: &lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;uptime -w&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Für uns meist: Sparc/Solaris oder Intel/Linux.
Bei einigen Kunden auch PPC/AIX oder Intel/SCO.
Äußerst wenige Kunden mit HP oder Digital Hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peilung des Maschinentyps (mit &lt;code&gt;uname -a&lt;/code&gt;) und der eingebauten Hardware.
In Solaris mit den drei Kommandos &lt;code&gt;prtconf&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;psrinfo&lt;/code&gt; und &lt;code&gt;prtdiag&lt;/code&gt;.
In Linux mit &lt;code&gt;lscpu&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;lspci&lt;/code&gt; oder indem man manuell durch &lt;code&gt;/proc&lt;/code&gt; turnt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Linux: &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solaris: &lt;code&gt;swap -l&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;swap -s&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wenn Accounting &amp;ldquo;up&amp;rdquo; ist (Solaris): &lt;code&gt;sar&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sar -r&lt;/code&gt; (freeswap), &lt;code&gt;sar -w&lt;/code&gt; (paging).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Linux (Suse 6.4): &lt;code&gt;sa&lt;/code&gt; aus dem Paket &lt;code&gt;ap1/acct.rpm&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der weitaus größte Teil aller Lastprobleme sind Speicherprobleme (zuwenig RAM, zu kleiner Swap).
Zweithäufigstes Problem ist fehlende I/O-Kapazität.
Fehlende CPU-Kapazität ist fast niemals das Problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erst messen, dann nachdenken, dann handeln (OODA loop &amp;ndash; Observe, Orient, Decide, Act).
Optimierungen ohne genaue Messungen und Kenntnis des tatsächlichen Problems sind Verschwendung der durch den Kunden bezahlten Arbeitszeit.
Punktmessungen können hilfreich sein, aber ein Wochenlastprofil ist sehr viel wertvoller (hier &lt;code&gt;sar&lt;/code&gt;-Beispiele von &lt;code&gt;boss&lt;/code&gt; und &lt;code&gt;prime&lt;/code&gt; bringen).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welche Interfaces und welche Routen werden tatsächlich wie oft verwendet?
Woher kommen die Routen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viele Kunden haben ein kaputtes Netzwerkonzept (d.h. keines) und setzen Routen eventuell manuell. Probleme sind vorprogrammiert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andere Kunden haben nur Default-Routen und bekommen differenzierte Routen nur über ICMP Redirect. Ebenfalls problematisch (Effizenz, Security).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Falls NIS: &lt;code&gt;ypwhich&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woher kommen die Namen, welcher Dienst wird verwendet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oft lokale Hostdateien -&amp;gt; Probleme! Im besten Fall DNS. Dann dort die Zone ansehen und Netzstruktur und Zonengröße abschätzen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welche Abhängigkeiten existieren zwischen den Servern?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ausfall- und Bootszenarien: Was ist, wenn der DNS-, der Time- oder der NIS-Server nicht da sind? Gibt es NFS-Platten, auf die die lokale Maschine angewiesen ist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security: Wer macht was in wessen Auftrag? Wer kontrolliert? Wird die Konfiguration manuell gepflegt oder existieren Frontends? Welche Dokumentationsprozeduren existieren?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Consulting: Viele verstorbene Pflegefälle wegen manuell gestarteter Dienste, die in keiner Konfigurationsdatei auftauchen.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Die meisten Fehler entstehen nicht durch falsche Software, sondern dumme User.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;/dev-Unterverzeichnisse 777 in HP/UX.&lt;/li&gt;
