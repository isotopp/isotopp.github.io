      <title>Climate change happened 30 years ago</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Water is a very weird substance. Melting ice at 0C to water at
0C takes a fantastic amount of energy: Water has a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_heat&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;latent
heat&lt;/a&gt;

 of 384J/gram.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/latent-heat-melting-solids-d_96.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Compared to other materials&lt;/a&gt;


that is pretty much at the upper end of the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warming up 1g of liquid water by 1C is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.britannica.com/science/calorie&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;original
definition&lt;/a&gt;

 of 1
Calorie, or 4.184 Joules in todays units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The water on our planet is a buffer that can store energy if
there is more energy incoming that the earth can dissipate, or
release energy if the bilancing is negative. Since some time
around 1990 the energy bilancing of our planet is positive and
the oceans are capturing energy at an alarming rate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/climate-ocean.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(via &lt;a href=&#34;//twitter.com/Lijing_Cheng/status/1183429014033092609&#34;&gt;Lijing Cheng&lt;/a&gt;

)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This acts as a buffer, keeping the air cooler than it should be given the
energy surplus we experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the yearly cycle of the sea ice in terms of area and
thickness can be plotted, and is shown to go around a mostly stable center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/climate-ice1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(via &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/simongerman600/status/1183474084694429696&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Simon Küstenmacher&lt;/a&gt;

)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this changes in the 1990ies, in a very alarming way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/climate-ice2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both, the sea ice and the water mass of the ocean, are buffers that keep the
earths climate on point and prevent it from changing quickly. But for the
last 30 years, since approximately 1990, we are putting more energy into the
system than it can dissipate, loading the buffers up more and more until we
exhaust them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once that happens, there will be a no mitigation any more and the atmosphere
will be warming up very rapidly and in a non-linear fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that even carbon neutrality at the current level will
not be enough: The earth will not become more retaining for infrared than it
already is, but the current level of CO2 is high enough to be
energy-positive and it continues to load the buffers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOAA keeps lists of CO2 over time at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.co2.earth/monthly-co2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;monthly CO2.earth&lt;/a&gt;

.
The current level of CO2 in our atmosphere is 408ppm in September 2019. In
September 1990, when this process started, it was 351 ppm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So basically we have been adding not quite 2ppm/year, and we need to get
back to 1990s levels in order to stabilize our home planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate change started already, 30 years ago, and currently we are living
off our safety buffers, the sea ice and the water masses of earth taking the
surplus and keeping us alive.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shared Space Experiment at Alexanderplein</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2017/sep/22/what-happens-if-you-turn-off-the-traffic-lights&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2017/09/alexanderplein-640x397.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2017/sep/22/what-happens-if-you-turn-off-the-traffic-lights&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Shared Space Experiment&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guardian has
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2017/sep/22/what-happens-if-you-turn-off-the-traffic-lights&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt;


about a Shared Space Experiment at Amsterdam Alexanderplein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_space&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Shared Space&lt;/a&gt;

 is an approach
to urban traffic design in which segregation of traffic modes is minimized
and signage or other regulation is taken away, leaving traffic participants
to make up rules and agreements on the spot through interaction. Several
preconditions need to be there in order for Shared Spaces to have a chance
of working:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The general population involved must have a good traffic &lt;strong&gt;education&lt;/strong&gt; :
They must be, at least in principle, capable of handling traffic on their
own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The traffic situation must be designed so that the various participants in
traffic are aware of each other - they must have &lt;strong&gt;visibility&lt;/strong&gt; of each
other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideally, they should have need to deal with only one problem or danger at
a time - problems need to be &lt;strong&gt;sequential&lt;/strong&gt; , and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;things need to happen at human speed. Traffic needs to be &lt;strong&gt;slow&lt;/strong&gt; and
everybody needs to be comparable in speed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these things are given, if you take away traffic lights and signage, the
intention of getting people to interact and agree on how to safely proceed -
to &lt;strong&gt;empower&lt;/strong&gt; them - usually works out very favorably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new setup forced people to engage with their surroundings. They had to
change the behavioural rituals they had fallen into in order to adapt.
Instead of relying on traffic lights, they now relied on their own
abilities and the cues of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A paper referenced in the article &lt;a href=&#34;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1206331210374149&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Negotiation in Motion&lt;/a&gt;


explains what goes on in more depth. The outcome: removing signals from a
busy junction, it made journeys faster and interactions more pleasant. Now
the approach is being copied across the city.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Separate Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/09/08/separate-infrastructure.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Sep 2017 20:31:47 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/09/08/separate-infrastructure.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2017/09/separate-infrastructure-640x423.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cargobike mum with child cycling independently on Upper Thames Street.
Unimaginable before cycling infrastructure. &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/AsEasyAsRiding/status/905444434288009216&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Mark Treasure&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people in Germany, especially Bike Activists, are stuck in the
80ies, victims of the Kampfradler mentality. Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at
that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The german word Kampfradler literally is made up from &amp;ldquo;Kampf&amp;rdquo; (fight) and
&amp;ldquo;Radler&amp;rdquo; (cyclist) . A Kampfradler is a fighting cyclist, or confrontational
cyclist. Wikipedia dates the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kampfradler&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Kampfradler&lt;/a&gt;

 to 2011, but it&amp;rsquo;s
much older. I remember having used the term during my time as a student in
Kiel, and that would date it to the mid-90ies at least. The Wikipedia
article also puts it into the context of a bike rowdy, but it&amp;rsquo;s really older
and it&amp;rsquo;s also being used by the Kampfradlers themselves with much more
positive connotations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclists are being marginalised in many places in Germany, and it takes
personal courage to be a presence in a car-centric traffic design and to
reclaim the road. Roads designed for cars often leave cyclists no way to
drive legal and safe at the same time. Kampfradler &amp;ldquo;know&amp;rdquo; that bike paths
are multiple times more deadly than painted bike lanes on the road, claiming
that bike paths hide cyclists until they suddenly appear when crossing a
road, and the way this stuff is being constructed in Germany it is true that
visibility of cyclists is suboptimal and often outright dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2017/09/altec-basic-28-inch-omafiets-zwart-52cm_1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Omafiets is being used by everyone, Omas as well as Jongens or
businessmen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a German living in the Netherlands, I have a direct comparison between
bike paths constructed for example in Kiel, in Berlin and in places like
urban and historic Amsterdam and rural, recently built Vijfhuizen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of observations to be made:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;casual-and-everyday&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#casual-and-everyday&#34;&gt;
	Casual and everyday
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biking in the Netherlands means casual biking at casual speeds. The goal
is to move swiftly, but relaxed. The Omafiets lets you sit upright, with
handlebars that curve gently towards you like the wings of a swallow -
unless you get wind from the front, in which case you might put the lower
arms onto the handlebars to have a lower and more aerodynamic profile. The
Objective is to move, but not to sweat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;all-ages-and-abilities-aaa&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#all-ages-and-abilities-aaa&#34;&gt;
	All Ages and Abilities (AAA)
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bike paths in the Netherlands are being built for everyone. That not only
includes, but specifically means weak participants in traffic - elderly
people as well as very young children. The image at the top of this
article is not from the Netherlands, but might have been shot around here
as well. The thinking expressed in the tweet coming with the image is also
fitting for the Netherlands. A situation like in this image will simply
never happen with bike lanes that are painted on a street - it is a thing
that only happens with separated biking infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;segration---paint-is-never-enough&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#segration---paint-is-never-enough&#34;&gt;
	Segration - paint is never enough
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biking infrastructure is not just separated bike paths. It also includes
ways of crossing roads in a safe way. A lot has been learned about this in
the last 25 years - see
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/03/13/we-learned-a-few-things-about-cycle-path-design-in-the-last-25-years.html&#34;&gt;this article in my blog&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, a bike path crosses the road on a bridge
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://goo.gl/maps/qS68d34Edop&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;N205 near Vijfhuizen&lt;/a&gt;

) or in a tunnel
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://goo.gl/maps/FUUVBsc14V92&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;N205 near Vijfhuizen&lt;/a&gt;

), so that cyclists and cars
cannot even conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When bikes and cars share a road without any kind of separation, car traffic
is limited to 30 km/h. Usually not just by signage, but also using physical
limitations, such as drempels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roundabouts are being used more a lot, compared to Germany and they can be
an awesome tool control car traffic speed, simplify intersections and keep
traffic flowing in residential areas. &lt;a href=&#34;https://goo.gl/maps/c2Sjn3s84xq&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;A small roundabout in
Vijfhuizen&lt;/a&gt;

 shows the red bikepath leaving
the road, crossing at the side of the roundabout and the continuing again
directly on the road. This solution is less than ideal, but safe enough at
the local traffic density and speed to be mastered by a 7 year old on a bike
alone, safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://goo.gl/maps/VhmPazGRoJA2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;This roundabout in Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt;

 is very
busy and crosses a tram line, two major inner city roads and quite some
bit of bike traffic on the same floor level. Building the bike path as a
road, wide and with two directions, next to a road, makes biking more
comfortable, also also simplifies leading traffic across intersections and
does not even necessarily use more space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example can be seen &lt;a href=&#34;https://goo.gl/maps/VhmPazGRoJA2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here next to Haarlem&lt;/a&gt;

,
leaving for the Dunes. They also
make other &amp;ldquo;typical&amp;rdquo; problems that Kampfradler experience immaterial -
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dooring&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;dooring&lt;/a&gt;

 does not exist in bike
infra built this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More examples in
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/world/europe/bicycling-utrecht-dutch-love-bikes-worlds-largest-bike-parking-garages.html?smid=tw-share&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;

historic city center that has built itself into one of the most bike
friendly environments in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How many chargers are necessary to convert the Netherlands to electric cars?</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/09/04/how-many-chargers-are-necessary-to-convert-the-netherlands-to-electric-cars.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Sep 2017 21:51:30 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/09/04/how-many-chargers-are-necessary-to-convert-the-netherlands-to-electric-cars.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pepijnvloemans.wordpress.com/2017/07/08/charging-infrastructure/amp/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;

 is the question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much infrastructure do we need when ALL 8 million vehicles
(and buses and trucks!) in the Netherlands go electric? The
answer will surprise you: we could get to 100% electric
transportation in the Netherlands, just by converting the 4000
existing gast stations to fast charging stations which have an
average of 14 fast chargers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;article then plays with numbers a bit: Kilometers driven,
electricity used, number of chargepoints, charging rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(for germans: The Netherlands compare in area and population
pretty well to Nordrhein-Westfalen)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Evaluating the Changing Causes of Photovoltaics Cost Reduction</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/08/08/evaluating-the-changing-causes-of-photovoltaics-cost-reduction.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 08 Aug 2017 13:44:36 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/08/08/evaluating-the-changing-causes-of-photovoltaics-cost-reduction.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2891516&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2017/08/pv-module-cost.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2891516&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Evaluating the Changing Causes of Photovoltaics Cost Reduction&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is PV Solar Energy getting cheaper and cheaper?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find that increased module efficiency was the leading low-level cause
of cost reduction in 1980-2001, contributing almost 30% of the cost
decline. The most important high-level mechanism was R&amp;amp;D in these earlier
stages of the technology. After 2001, scale economies became a more
significant cause of cost reduction, approaching R&amp;amp;D in importance.
Policies that stimulate market growth have played a key role in enabling
the cost reduction in PV, through privately-funded R&amp;amp;D and economies of
scale, and to a lesser extent learning-by-doing&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Financial dynamics of a shift to BEV transport</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/07/26/financial-dynamics-of-a-shift-to-bev-transport.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2017 12:05:33 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/07/26/financial-dynamics-of-a-shift-to-bev-transport.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The German Language podcast Lage der Nation has published an
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kuechenstud.io/lagedernation/2017/07/25/ldn-sommerinterview-1-axel-friedrich-zu-diesel-gate/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;interview with Axel Friedrich&lt;/a&gt;


on Dieselgate. Axel Friedrich has been a department lead in the German
Umweltbundesamt until 2008, now working with BUND and other environmental
NGOs in Germany and instrumental in uncovering Dieselgate on the German
side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interview contains some very interesting remarks on rental car companies
and car maker owned car leasing companies, and how the shape the car market.
A deprecation of Diesel cars by those leasing companies is instrumental to
transforming the car maret and in promoting the shift to BEVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar, but different concerns from Bloomberg in
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-30/auto-debt-risk-spreads-to-europe-as-leases-create-used-car-glut&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Europe’s Car-Leasing Boom Sets Off Alarm Bells&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyers of notes backed by auto debt are increasingly vulnerable to drops
in used-vehicle prices because more and more drivers in Europe are leasing
cars and trading them in for new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[…]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If there’s a steeper decline in car values, then borrowers will be
incentivized to return their vehicles and it will be bondholders who bear
any losses,” said Aaron Baker, a London-based credit analyst at Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA. “This exposure to used-car prices could be
catastrophic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, cars are valuable things and are being used to secure loans and
bonds, and are also bought on loans and bonds where the intrinsic value of
the vehicle is being used to secure the load for buying it. Changes in the
price of used cars by shifts in how cars are bought (In the future, less
people want to own a car) and which cars have value (In the future, Diesel
will be close to worthless and people want to buy BEVs) are threats to
credit security and to the financial business around car purchase in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change to BEVs and to self-driving cars will be much more disruptive
than anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Digging through my bookmarks and open tabs was interesting. The picture of
the future that emerges: With costs for energy approaching the 1 cent range
per kWh, electrical energy is going to be close to free. Money can and will
be charged for guarantees, because batteries or other forms of storage still
cost money.&lt;/p&gt;

»The new renewable energy capacity installed worldwide in 2016 was 161GW,
a 10% rise on 2015 […] The new record capacity cost $242bn, a 23%
reduction in investment compared to 2015, and renewables investment
remained larger than for all fossil fuels. Subsidies for green energy,
however, are still much lower than those for coal, oil and gas.«&lt;/li&gt;

 »Former
President Jimmy Carter leased a 10-acre (40.000 sqm) site in his hometown

provide over 50% of the power needs of the City of Plains.«&lt;/li&gt;

»What is the integration threshold? There is no threshold, per se. The
cost of managing intermittency is nonlinear and depends upon the mix and
location of dispatchable and non-dispatchable sources, the match of local
demand patterns with variable source pattern, and various other factors.
Based on model studies of Germany and Indiana, Falko Ueckerdt found
integration costs began to become significant at 20% [intermittent energy
sources].«&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Rethinking Transportation</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/05/23/rethinking-transportation.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 23 May 2017 15:39:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/05/23/rethinking-transportation.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tony Seba (Stanford University) came up with a kind of best-case scenario
for electrification and decarbonization.
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ourenergypolicy.org/rethinking-transportation-2020-2030-the-disruption-of-transportation-and-the-collapse-of-the-internal-combustion-vehicle-and-oil-industries/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Rethinking Transportation 2020-2030&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;rdquo;
sees a self-amplifiying change in how we travel and transport things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2030, within 10 years of regulatory approval of autonomous vehicles
(AVs), 95% of U.S. passenger miles traveled will be served by on-demand
autonomous electric vehicles owned by fleets, not individuals, in a new
business model we call “transportas-a-service” (TaaS). The TaaS disruption
will have enormous implications across the transportation and oil
industries, decimating entire portions of their value chains, causing oil
demand and prices to plummet, and destroying trillions of dollars in
investor value — but also creating trillions of dollars in new business
opportunities, consumer surplus and GDP growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ourenergypolicy.org/rethinking-transportation-2020-2030-the-disruption-of-transportation-and-the-collapse-of-the-internal-combustion-vehicle-and-oil-industries/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2017/05/rethinkx.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ourenergypolicy.org/rethinking-transportation-2020-2030-the-disruption-of-transportation-and-the-collapse-of-the-internal-combustion-vehicle-and-oil-industries/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Rethinking Transportation&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It won&amp;rsquo;t quite happen this way, especially when it comes to TaaS, because
the economic basis for that won&amp;rsquo;t exist easily, but very likely the switch
will happen faster than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transport-as-a-service means that an institutional owner for transportation
must exist. That owner must have a way to get rid of used vehicles. At the
moment, car rental agencies sell off rental cars after a rather short time
period into private ownership. That is also why rental cars do not look more
like rental cars, despite a number of obvious improvements coming to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a TaaS-heavy society, demand for private car ownerhip may be so low that
the institutional owner for cars does not have an easy way to get rid of
these vehicles. If and how much of that pressure exists is unclear at the
moment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/04/29/the-bike-as-a-feeder-system-to-the-train-system.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A talk by Marco te Brömmelstroet and others about how neither the Bike nor
the train themselves are a viable transport alternative, but how they
together are much more than the sum of their parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://cyclingacademics.blogspot.nl/2015/03/nine-arguments-for-seeing-bicycle-train.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://cyclingacademics.blogspot.nl/2015/03/nine-arguments-for-seeing-bicycle-train.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Nine Arguments for seeing bicycle-train as one mobility system&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biking increases the catchment area of train stations, allowing
an increase of the distance between stops for stop-trains, and consequently
also for all higher-order trains. This speeds up the train system, making it
a lot more attractive and a lot more viable. Both bike-use and train-use
increase, making the high-density urban environment more liveable and
attractive as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Strong weak ties</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/04/05/strong-weak-ties.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Apr 2017 11:42:32 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/04/05/strong-weak-ties.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A long time ago, I wrote a text on the German Blog and on Carta:
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.carta.info/41830/wieso-wir-uns-veroffentlichen/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Wieso wir uns veröffentlichen&lt;/a&gt;


(Why we publish ourselves).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the middle of a discussion about privacy I was explaining why people
publish themselves, why they publicly reveal (sometimes intimate) facts
about themselves. They are doing this, I wrote, to find other like-minded
people, to become searchable and to become approachable, to build trust.
Trust is a wonderful thing. It is the powerful assumption that most people
most of the time want to help you and that falsely trying out to trust
people is a recoverable mistake. Having trust and being in a trustworthy
environment keeps transactional costs low and makes cooperation possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s rewarding and awesome. How does this work in practice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So tomorrow there is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.messefrankfurt.com/frankfurt/en/besucher/welcome/messeveranstaltungen/messen/entertainment-media-creation/prolight_sound2017.html?nc&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Pro Light and Sound in Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt;

.
Sammy wants to go there, and gets the combination ticket. That&amp;rsquo;s admission
to the trade show, plus a ticket for German rail. That ticket is being
delivered as a Bahn Tix code, which you can
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypxepZLxff8&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;punch into any German ticket machine&lt;/a&gt;


and get a printout. We are in the Netherlands. The next ticket machine is in
Venlo. The route she&amp;rsquo;s going to use does not pass Venlo. There is
&lt;a href=&#34;http://praxistipps.chip.de/bahntix-online-ausdrucken-geht-das_44999&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;no way to get Bahn Tix online&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am asking on Google plus for help, and because I know at least one person
following me is a Train Driver I mention them into the thread. Sammy, me and
that person get into a Hangout. Ticket is being picked up and given the
train driver of ICE 220 FFM -&amp;gt; Amsterdam Centraal. Shift change at the
border, ticket travels on to Amsterdam, +30 platform change 7b -&amp;gt; 2.
Printed Ticket is being successfully delivered from the engine to Sammy at
11:58.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a direct application of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_ties&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Interpersonal Ties&lt;/a&gt;


theory (pointing to article by
&lt;a href=&#34;https://sociology.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/the_strength_of_weak_ties_and_exch_w-gans.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Granovetter&lt;/a&gt;


(1973) and in a way to the works of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/Ultrasociety-Years-Humans-Greatest-Cooperators/dp/0996139516&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Peter Turchin&lt;/a&gt;

.
High trust societies are societies where people have
&lt;a href=&#34;http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/weak_ties.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;many weak ties&lt;/a&gt;

,
that can be strengthened as demand arises. It&amp;rsquo;s these strong weak ties that
enable (inter-) action and where cooperation wins between people are
highest. In order to have strong weak ties, a society needs to have a
relatively low and controlled wealth difference
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Gini coefficient&lt;/a&gt;

) and a
working judicial system and low corruption. This creates social cohesion,
and enables &amp;ldquo;random&amp;rdquo; cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, you win friends. Looking forward to a visit, soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Electric car confusion</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/03/23/electric-car-confusion.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Mar 2017 11:32:33 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/03/23/electric-car-confusion.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Autoblog titles:
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.autoblog.com/2017/02/21/race-for-autonomous-cars-is-over-mcelroy-autoline-opinion/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The race for autonomous cars is over. Silicon Valley lost&lt;/a&gt;

.
The point they want to make is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To paraphrase Elon Musk, Silicon Valley is learning that &amp;ldquo;Making rockets
is hard, but making cars is really hard.&amp;rdquo; People outside of the auto
industry tend to have a shallow understanding of how complex the business
really is. They think all you have to do is design a car and start making
it. But most startups never make it past the concept car stage because the
move to mass production proves too daunting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, while companies like Google and Apple are giving up on making cars,
they&amp;rsquo;re not giving up on the auto industry. There is another area where
Silicon Valley could play a dominant role and it&amp;rsquo;s all about accessing
car-based data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s about the margins - making a thing gives you around 10% markup, making
things out of data gives you much, much higher margins. This also frames the
current discussions about privacy within the German government, and who is
to own your data (hint: not you), especially when you drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But making software systems is also really, really hard. And an electric,
self-driving car is much more a system, then a piece of software and then a
piece of hardware. And
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forbes.com/sites/aalsin/2017/03/14/why-general-motors-has-already-lost-to-tesla/#79c1f64d3ccb&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Forbes sees the automotive industry not really in a strong position&lt;/a&gt;


here, focusing on GM and Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, I don’t see how GM isn’t making a meaningful strategic pivot
to electric, especially compared to Tesla. Why? By March 2017, GM sold a
little over 2,000 Bolts, which retail around $37,000. By way of
comparison, Tesla has delivered “over 183,000 Model S and X vehicles over
the last four years,” according to Electrek. And then there’s the Model 3.
Tesla has received over 400,000 customer deposits for its Model 3, which
is priced at $35,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What GM does with the Ampera-e looks like a compliance stunt to get fleet
consumption down, not like a credible electric move, to some: Greenwashing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-23-at-11.30.56.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what to make of it? Making cars is hard. Making self-driving, electric cars
is even harder, because it involves the hard tasks from making large
physical machines and the hard tasks from making distributed, secure
software systems. Traditional car makers are not delivering (GM singled out
above, but the others are guilty, too). And are not pivoting aggressively
and fast enough into software and into electric. On the other hand, Silicon
valley has largely pulled out of making large physical objects, and focuses
on the data generated by drivers. Only Tesla seems to move at speed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-13-at-14.37.54.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any discussion about cycling in Germany, sooner or later some geek who
has been exposed to USENET shows up and then the ADFC #173
(&lt;a href=&#34;http://bernd.sluka.de/Radfahren/fdf173.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://bernd.sluka.de/Radfahren/fdf173.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

) is being quoted. That&amp;rsquo;s a thing
from 1992.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual thing happened &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/konni.scheller/posts/601278760077183&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;

 - a
discussion about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.solaroad.nl/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SolaRoad Krommenie&lt;/a&gt;

 diverged
into &amp;ldquo;Cycle Paths are stupid&amp;rdquo; and then linked over to the ADFC #173.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a bunch of more recent material and links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2017/03/side-by-side-cycling.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TL;DR is: When there is no proper traffic separation or traffic
separation is impossible, then an on-the-road cycle path, is usually better
than a cycle path that runs more or less invisibly by the road and then
suddenly intersects with the road at crossings. But a cycle path on the
road, not separated by traffic has a number of drawbacks - paint is never
enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It reduces cycling in &amp;ldquo;weak&amp;rdquo; cyclists, very young and older people,
feeling insecure close to cars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It prevents building wide cycle pathes, and prevents &amp;ldquo;social&amp;rdquo; cycling, that is,
usually two cyclists can&amp;rsquo;t be riding side by side, talking while cycling,
like people in a car would be able to do it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It comes with speed limits on the car in order to be safe. In the
Netherlands, cycle lanes on roads come with a 30 km/h speed limit
recommended for cars, and a 50 km/h absolute limit.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usually, for 50 km/h a cycle path that is somehow separated from the
road, and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2014/05/the-best-roundabout-design-for-cyclists.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;roundabouts&lt;/a&gt;


instead of crossings are recommended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For faster than 50 km/h,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2012/04/100-segregation-of-bikes-and-cars.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;unravelling&lt;/a&gt;


(intersection free cycle paths) are recommended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A View from the Cycle Path is generally a recommended blog. They have an
article about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2014/04/on-road-cycle-lanes-good-bad-and-ugly.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;On The Road Cycle Lanes&lt;/a&gt;

,
done properly and improperly. The &lt;strong&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Better&lt;/strong&gt; section at the end of
the article discusses better solutions: Separate cycle paths with
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2014/05/the-best-roundabout-design-for-cyclists.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;roundabouts&lt;/a&gt;

,
and

(completely separate, intersection free infrastructures for different types of traffic). The
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/search/label/cycle%20paths&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Cycle Paths tag&lt;/a&gt;

 in the
blog shows a lot of examples. An
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2012/04/100-segregation-of-bikes-and-cars.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;article on unravelling&lt;/a&gt;


shows intersection free infrastructure. An example for unravelling can be
seen
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.nl/maps/dir/Graan&amp;#43;voor&amp;#43;Visch&amp;#43;14402,&amp;#43;Hoofddorp/Hoofddorp,&amp;#43;Station,&amp;#43;2132&amp;#43;HA&amp;#43;Hoofddorp/@52.2929719,4.6950909,210m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x47c5e7a6b423096d:0xc6352d61ad3008ff!2m2!1d4.6914988!2d52.2952505!1m5!1m1!1s0x47c5e70a44c2d41f:0x34a4aa65b173485d!2m2!1d4.6985328!2d52.2927456?hl=en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;on Google Maps close to Hoofddorp Station&lt;/a&gt;


and in many other places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-13-at-15.00.44-300x195.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another article explains
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2014/05/the-best-roundabout-design-for-cyclists.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;safe roundabouts&lt;/a&gt;


for bike lanes crossing road safely at intersections. The keys to the design
are: The cycle path is led in a way that the cyclists are forced to slow
down exactly at the dangerous point, and not before, accelerating into a
danger zone, and the road is led in a way that motorists have to deal only
with one danger at a time, and always into the same direction, right-ahead
(two o&amp;rsquo;clock), and have adequate room to stop and wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, separation of on-the-road cycle paths can be relatively simple and
cheap, as shown by this
&lt;a href=&#34;http://road.cc/content/news/218361-toilet-plungers-are-being-used-create-guerrilla-bike-lanes-and-highlight-crap&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Guerilla improvement action using toilet plungers&lt;/a&gt;

are also being discussed in that blog. How did the Netherlands become such a
good country for cycling? It started in the 70ies,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/may/05/amsterdam-bicycle-capital-world-transport-cycling-kindermoord&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here is an article&lt;/a&gt;

.
In fact,

in the Netherlands that other countries wish to have, and

      <title>Solar plus Storage in Australia</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/02/24/solar-plus-storage-in-australia.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2017 20:26:28 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/02/24/solar-plus-storage-in-australia.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_South_Australian_blackout&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;2016 South Australia Blackout&lt;/a&gt;

, a
storm lead to a cascading failure, with in turn left 1/6 of the continent
without electricity. Fortunately, this is not a densely populated area even
for australian circumstances, so it affected some 1.5 mio people (out of 20
mio total for all of Australia) - still quite a lot of people. The
&lt;a href=&#34;https://electrek.co/2016/10/04/tesla-powerwall-owner-powers-through-south-australias-state-wide-blackout/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;news of a 73-year-old Tesla Powerwall owner&lt;/a&gt;


powering through this outage without even noticing made the headlines in the
aftermath, and in consequence demand for PV + Battery combination surged. In
total, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.energy-storage.news/news/1016&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;more than 50GWh&lt;/a&gt;

 have been
installed in 2016 alone, and demand is climbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ties into a
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theage.com.au/national/the-death-spiral-scaring-electricity-providers-20140706-zsy76.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;three year old discussion&lt;/a&gt;


about the grid death spiral which is scaring electricty providers: As more
and more households become grid-independent, cost for maintaining the grid
and providing electricity becomes higher, making the grid eventually
economically infeasible, and making going off-grid mandatory - which for
some consumers may be impossible:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk for the companies is that when people get the option of putting
solar panels on their roofs and installing batteries and cutting the cord,
demand will fall sharply. The people who end up left on the network will
be the only ones left paying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will be stuck with extremely high network charges, forcing even more
people off the network, pushing network charges higher still. It is what
Ms Carter calls &amp;ldquo;your death spiral scenario&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, savings through a Powerwall or other battery devices on
top of a PV installation can be spectacular -
&lt;a href=&#34;https://electrek.co/2017/02/21/tesla-powerwall-one-year-ownership/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;one owner in Australia reports a 92% bill reduction&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>On Normalcy: The rest times of truck drivers in Europe</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/02/09/on-normalcy-the-rest-times-of-truck-drivers-in-europe.html</link>

      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/02/09/on-normalcy-the-rest-times-of-truck-drivers-in-europe.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dvz.de/rubriken/landverkehr/single-view/nachricht/eugh-generalanwalt-fahrer-duerfen-wochenruhezeit-nicht-im-lkw-verbringen.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;DVZ Landverkehr reports&lt;/a&gt;


(article in German):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LKW-Fahrer dürfen ihre wöchentliche Ruhezeit nicht im Fahrzeug verbringen.
Zu diesem Ergebnis kommt Generalanwalt Evgeni Tanchev in seinen
Schlussanträgen vom 2. Februar vor dem Europäischen Gerichtshof (EuGH).
Hintergrund ist die Klage des Transportunternehmens Vaditrans gegen den
Belgischen Staat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&amp;ldquo;Truck drivers must not spend their weekly downtime within the vehicle.
That&amp;rsquo;s the conclusion drawn by general attorney Evgeni Tanchev in his
final plea of Feb, 2nd before the ECJ. Background is a complaint of
Vaditrans vs. Belgium&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most European countries require that the weekly downtime of
truck drivers must not be spent in the vehicle. Vaditrans sued
against this rule and the penalties for violation. European law
allows daily downtimes to be spent in the cabin, but says
nothing about weekly downtimes. Local rules in many states
require that the drivers must not spent them on the vehicle.
The same proceedings are also reported in
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eurotransport.de/news/europaeischer-gerichtshof-fahrer-duerfen-ruhezeit-nicht-im-lkw-verbringen-8816561.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Eurotransport&lt;/a&gt;


(article in German).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comments below the article rage against the ruling, with
many commenters asking how this could possibly be implemented or
how the ruling is unfair, cost intensive and generally wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition of what is normal apparently can be distorted
quite heavily - normal for most people obviously would be that
drivers to park their vehicles next to a motel and sleep in
proper rooms and beds, with proper meals and sanitary
installations, every day, because that&amp;rsquo;s how jobs work in a
civilization. Instead, people rage against requiring that
drivers can and should be doing this at least on their weekends,
claiming this to be impossible and abnormal.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Video: 20 Years of continuous improvement in crash safety</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/02/09/video-20-years-of-continuous-improvement-in-crash-safety.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2017 07:56:54 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Continual improvement is sometimes hard to see, because each iteration, each
incremental step itself is tiny so that the actual change escapes our
attention. Also, just living our lives, our time sense is sometimes
distorted. Me for example, I was almost 30 already in the late Nineties, and
while that is already 20 years ago, it feels like yesterday to me. So car
safety in the Nineties, compared to now? It was crap. Check this out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/pwGgRUkrnng&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We do learn, and things do get better. Change is not radical, most of the
time it&amp;rsquo;s evolutionary. And to make it visible, you have to look really hard
and contract now and then.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stockholm&#39;s congestion charge vs. Asthma</title>

on the congestion charge in Stockholm
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2017/preliminary/1901&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Link to actual paper&lt;/a&gt;

).
Stockholm always has been a city with relatively clean air and PM10 and NOx
levels well below limits. The introduction of a congestion charge in 2007
reduced air pollution in Stockholm by approximately 10 percent. Yet, after
several years, Asthma in children 0-5 years old is reduced of 45 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It appears that what they&amp;rsquo;ve found is these cumulative effects of
pollution,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article also reminds city policy makers that a congestion charge can
only work if a viable public transport infrastructure is already in place.&lt;/p&gt;
