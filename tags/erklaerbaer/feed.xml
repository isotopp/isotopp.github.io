 vorhanden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week was &amp;ldquo;Broken Security Software Advertising Week.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;fortigate-and-ivanti&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#fortigate-and-ivanti&#34;&gt;
	Fortigate and Ivanti
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, &lt;strong&gt;today&lt;/strong&gt; was Fortigate patch day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/schlangenoel-01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CVE-2024-23113, CVSSV3 Score 9.8, Unauthorized Code Execution, &amp;ldquo;Format String Bug&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A use of &lt;a href=&#34;https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/134.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;externally-controlled format string&lt;/a&gt;

 vulnerability
in FortiOS &lt;code&gt;fgfmd&lt;/code&gt; daemon may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code or
commands via specially crafted requests.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a case where a C function accepts a format string like &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;Blah %s Nonsense&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;,
to assemble a log message or a command for a &lt;code&gt;system()&lt;/code&gt; call.
However, the developer did not statically set the format parameter of the command to a format string
(&lt;code&gt;snprintf(buffer, length, &amp;quot;Blah %s Nonsense&amp;quot;, user_input)&lt;/code&gt;),
but instead took the user input as the format
(&lt;code&gt;snprintf(buffer, length, user_input))&lt;/code&gt;.
The user input can thus be used to do all sorts of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a mistake automatically detected by the usual source code scanners.
If you try to commit or merge something like this in a modern development environment,
the scanner will thoroughly humiliate you,
the commit will be rejected, and you will be assigned a security training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means this type of error does not occur in a contemporary development environment anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;strong&gt;yesterday&lt;/strong&gt; was Fortigate patch day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/schlangenoel-02.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CVE-2024-21762, CVSSV3 Score 9.6, Unauthorized Code Execution, &amp;ldquo;Out of Bounds Write&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A &lt;a href=&#34;https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;out-of-bounds write&lt;/a&gt;

 vulnerability
in FortiOS may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code or command via specially crafted HTTP requests.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a mistake easily made in C or other languages without index checking when accessing arrays.
In C, for example, one can access memory before the array using negative indices,
and if an error code is -1, but the error code is not checked after a function call, then everything goes up in flames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of error is not always found by source code scanners with a static analyzer,
but most cases should be flagged by the scanner as a code smell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, unfortunately, &lt;strong&gt;the day before yesterday&lt;/strong&gt; was also a Fortigate patch day.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fortinet-warns-of-new-fortisiem-rce-bugs-in-confusing-disclosure/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;BleepingComputer reports&lt;/a&gt;

:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this instance, due to an issue with the API which we are currently investigating,
rather than an edit, this resulted in two new CVEs being created, duplicates of the original CVE-2023-34992,
FortiNet told BleepingComputer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it turns out that CVE-2024-23108 and CVE-2024-23109 are actually patch bypasses for the CVE-2023-34992
flaw discovered by Horizon3 vulnerability expert Zach Hanley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this was a patch for a patch because the mitigation didn&amp;rsquo;t work,
and Fortinet got confused with the CVE numbers due to the sheer volume of them currently open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the US CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency)
is demanding all US institutions to shut down Ivanti VPN (formerly Juniper Pulse Secure):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/schlangenoel-03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;CISA is requiring all Federal agencies to disconnect Ivanti products by Friday at midnight
(Ivanti Connect Secure &amp;amp; Ivanti Policy Secure).
This is roughly 48-hours notice, to not patch, but rip it out!
Ivanti is an American company.
This is unprecedented.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/supplemental-direction-v1-ed-24-01-mitigate-ivanti-connect-secure-and-ivanti-policy-secure&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;original directive&lt;/a&gt;


could initially be interpreted as an update, re-installation, and reconfiguration, this hope has now been dashed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patches mentioned are not suitable for fixing the error.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://infosec.exchange/@briankrebs/111863433959430768&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Brian Krebs has summarized this issue&lt;/a&gt;

:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, someone opened up the Ivanti image and took a look inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/schlangenoel-04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Versions of software that have been routinely outdated for more than a decade in the current image.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As curl developer Stefan Eissing phrases it, these are &amp;ldquo;corpse parts and zombie software.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, as expected, a few days after the CISA-mandated patch frenzy,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ivanti-patch-new-connect-secure-auth-bypass-bug-immediately/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;BleepingComputer headlines again&lt;/a&gt;

:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ivanti: Patch new Connect Secure auth bypass bug immediately&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flaw (CVE-2024-22024) is due to an XXE
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;XML eXternal Entities&lt;/a&gt;

) weakness in the gateways&amp;rsquo; SAML component
that lets remote attackers gain access to restricted resources on unpatched appliances in low-complexity
attacks without requiring user interaction or authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAML, Security Assertion Markup Language, is an XML notation for access rights in Single Sign-On systems.
Because it&amp;rsquo;s an XML notation, it can have these &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;blablub;&lt;/code&gt; things – Entities – that are replaced by other text.
With External Entities, the replacement text is not locally fixed but is downloaded from the net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean in the context of SAML?
It means that the access rights in the document are not necessarily fixed;
an attacker can load Entity definitions from the net.
Depending on where the Entity is used, it can partially or completely rewrite the SAML file and grant different rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XML parsers are well understood,
and XXE is something that can be reliably scanned for automatically with a source code scanner.
This type of error is easily avoidable in modern development environments.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not an exception and is not limited to VPN gateways,
but rather manufacturers of security software happily rely on
&amp;ldquo;security-relevant software with privileges, and programming methods from the 90s of the last millennium.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples from this blog:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/10/20/aslr.html&#34;&gt;ASLR&lt;/a&gt;

: macOS Trend Micro Binary without ASLR, every exploit (yes, there are some)
automatically stable across the entire fleet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2018/06/18/websense-dlp-gives-instant-root.html&#34;&gt;Websense DLP gives instant root&lt;/a&gt;

:
WebSense DLP ships outdated software versions and an exploitable kernel module, probably missing QA and defective shipping process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is so widespread in endpoint security that, for example,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mastodon.social/@joxean&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;@joxean&lt;/a&gt;


has written an entire book about it:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/Antivirus-Hackers-Handbook-English-ebook/dp/B014MJ6AKS&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Antivirus Hacker&amp;rsquo;s Handbook&lt;/a&gt;

.
It describes how to find vulnerabilities of this kind in every – literally every – AV software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is systematic: It is due to the way this software is designed and developed, and it cannot be fixed with patches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this because I played this game for a few years with a company Mac:
I used the so-called &amp;ldquo;security tools&amp;rdquo; that Corp installed on my Mac to gain privileges on my Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole process is reliably repeatable, and I never had to invest more than a slow Friday afternoon in any case.
And I am not even a &amp;ldquo;security researcher,&amp;rdquo; just an amateur with reverse engineering experience from the C64 era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is this software, which is supposed to protect, ending up making the computer vulnerable.
When someone like Fefe talks about &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.fefe.de/?q=Schlangen&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;snake oil&lt;/a&gt;

, it is to be taken literally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/schlangenoel-05.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_oil&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Snake-Oil&lt;/a&gt;

 is a term used to describe deceptive marketing,
health care fraud, or a scam.
Similarly, snake oil salesman is a common label used to describe someone who sells, promotes,
or is a general proponent of some valueless or fraudulent cure, remedy, or solution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#a-list-of-problems-and-outdated-processes&#34;&gt;
	A List of Problems and Outdated Processes
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are talking about critically security-relevant software here,
which is supposed to prevent the intrusion of malware and attackers on computers,
or is supposed to detect such attacks, or has authentication or some other form of security-relevant function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It runs at critical points, often with privileges, and when it fails, it is not just one machine,
but often an entire company that is critically exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such software should be developed with tools and methods that are state-of-the-art
and undergo critical inspection with regard to correctness, freedom from errors, and currency of dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we see errors that suggest deficiencies in the development process at all points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are seeing critical errors that would not have to have major problematic impact
if the software had been written with minimal rights from the outset.
But running parsers for complex, unknown data formats that may contain potentially malicious payloads with privileges?
And then turning off elementary security mechanisms such as ASLR?
That means setting up for maximum damage.
It is not a winnable position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doing all this in 2024 in C, when Go or Rust could have been used? Not particularly smart either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packing your deliverables with software that, in the case of Ivanti, has been without patches for up to two decades?
Correct would be to have an automated release process that assembles a new release from the latest versions of everything
and tests it automatically.
What Ivanti delivers is not just &amp;ldquo;not state-of-the-art,&amp;rdquo; it is grossly negligent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delivering all this in an encrypted image, instead of with a &amp;ldquo;SBOM of Shame&amp;rdquo;
is soon to be a federal crime in the USA, and the EU is on the same path. Good.
(An SBOM is a Software Bill Of Materials, a list of the dependencies used and their versions.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &amp;ldquo;Format String Bug&amp;rdquo; or an &amp;ldquo;XML External Entities Vulnerability&amp;rdquo; are trivial errors that source code scanners can detect.
Such source scanners are being advertised by these security firms themselves or even developed in-house.
But these tools are not in use internally, because otherwise, such code could never have made it into a product.
This does not require AI; in part, these are better regular expressions, sometimes a bit of static analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As external observers, based on the demonstrated error patterns,
we are witnessing a failure along the entire software development chain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the architecture level (not minimizing rights),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at the tool level (no scanners for trivial errors, outdated dependencies, no automation in build and release),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at the packaging level (the defective permissions in Websense, for example),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and at every other point where one can infer the process from the errors observed from the outside.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, &amp;ldquo;no functioning code review and audit&amp;rdquo;
(&amp;ldquo;statically compiled-in backdoor passwords,&amp;rdquo; as are a persistent problem at Cisco, fall under this).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are thus management errors in the leadership of software companies that produce security-critical software.
It is the responsibility of management to establish and control processes that ensure a minimum level of quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion &amp;ldquo;software errors, nothing can be done about it&amp;rdquo; is incorrect –
there are entire classes of errors that can be definitively avoided through architecture,
automatic scanning,
education,
review,
and testing.
It is the responsibility of management to establish and control such processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, one can only conclude that irresponsible hack shops without fundamental software development processes
are masquerading as &amp;ldquo;security&amp;rdquo; companies.
They are packaging radioactive toxic waste in glossy packages,
thereby building a highway for nation-state actors into the heart of critical infrastructures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, the nature of the error borders on deliberate sabotage, or,
to put it another way, it could hardly be worse with deliberate sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;1010-no-notes&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#1010-no-notes&#34;&gt;
	10/10, no notes
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On IRC, my friends joke:
&amp;ldquo;Are you a 10/10 company?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security vulnerabilities are not only assigned a unique number, the CVE number,
but they also receive a severity grade,
the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerability_Scoring_System&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CVSS-Score&lt;/a&gt;

.
A 10/10 is the maximum grade, but basically, anything above 8 is considered
&lt;a href=&#34;https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;a total loss and complete process failure&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is now a historical CVE database that can be
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/cvssscoremin-9/cvssscoremax-10/vulnerabilities.html?page=1&amp;amp;cvssscoremin=9&amp;amp;cvssscoremax=10&amp;amp;order=3&amp;amp;trc=40515&amp;amp;sha=2721cbf47ba1e57d8b65ae1c3cf8883295fd04d7&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;sorted by CVSS score&lt;/a&gt;

,
and also narrowed down to companies like
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-3080/Fortinet.html?page=1&amp;amp;cvssscoremin=9&amp;amp;order=3&amp;amp;trc=103&amp;amp;sha=0ba96ce0b5ea0195196988ef1d381bdd33622c49&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Fortinet&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then see for Fortinet a series of 12 errors with a 10/10 rating,
specifically 2x in 2024, 1x in 2021, 1x in 2019, 3x in 2017, 4x in 2016, and once in 2005.
This can also be summarized as &amp;ldquo;no improvement is observable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Security is a process,&amp;rdquo; it is often said.
For Business Continuity Management, I once wrote down what that means:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/02/18/this-is-not-a-drill.html&#34;&gt;This is not a Drill. This is just Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar considerations can be made for secure software development processes,
and there are even ready-made process blueprints available for this purpose.
Furthermore, as I have shown, the patterns of errors can reveal the weaknesses in the internal development process
with regard to security best practices.
The numbers of CVEs and CVSS scores can indicate whether a company has improved its posture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it is apparent that this has not been the case over the years, how can a purchasing decision be made positively?
Something to think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some things can only be made bearable with cute guinea pig photos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This text also has a version in
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2024/02/10/snake-oil.html&#34;&gt;english language&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diese Woche war &amp;ldquo;Kaputte Security Software Werbewoche&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;fortigate-und-ivanti&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#fortigate-und-ivanti&#34;&gt;
	Fortigate und Ivanti
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zunächst einmal war &lt;strong&gt;heute&lt;/strong&gt; Fortigate Patchday:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/schlangenoel-01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CVE-2024-23113, CVSSV3 Score 9.8, Unauthorized Code Execution, &amp;ldquo;Format String Bug&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A use of &lt;a href=&#34;https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/134.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;externally-controlled format string&lt;/a&gt;

 vulnerability
in FortiOS &lt;code&gt;fgfmd&lt;/code&gt; daemon may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code or
commands via specially crafted requests.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist ein Fall, wo eine C-Funktion einen Formatstring mit &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;Bla %s Fasel&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; annimmt,
um etwa eine Log-Nachricht oder ein Kommando für einen &lt;code&gt;system()&lt;/code&gt; Aufruf zusammenzubauen.
Der Entwickler hat jedoch den Format-Parameter des Kommandos nicht statisch auf einen Formatstring gesetzt
(&lt;code&gt;snprintf(buffer, length, &amp;quot;Bla %s Fasel&amp;quot;, benutzereingabe)&lt;/code&gt;),
sondern stattdessen die Benutzereingabe als Format genommen
(&lt;code&gt;snprintf(buffer, length, benutzereingabe)&lt;/code&gt;).
Die Benutzereingabe kann so verwendet werden, um alles Mögliche zu tun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist ein Fehler, der von den üblichen Sourcecodescannern automatisch erkannt wird,
und wenn man in einer modernen Entwicklungsumgebung versucht, so etwas zu comitten oder zu mergen,
dann wird man vom Scanner ganz furchtbar erniedrigt, der Commit zurückgewiesen und man bekommt ein Security-Training zugewiesen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will sagen, dieser Fehler tritt in einer zeitgemäßen Development-Umgebung nicht mehr auf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Auch gestern&lt;/strong&gt; war Fortigate Patchday:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/schlangenoel-02.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CVE-2024-21762, CVSSV3 Score 9.6, Unauthorized Code Execution, &amp;ldquo;Out of Bounds Write&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A &lt;a href=&#34;https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;out-of-bounds write&lt;/a&gt;

 vulnerability
in FortiOS may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code or command via specially crafted HTTP requests.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist ein Fehler, der in C oder anderen Sprachen ohne Indexprüfung beim Zugriff auf Arrays gerne gemacht wird.
In C kann man zum Beispiel mit negativen Indices auf Speicher vor dem Array zugreifen, und
wenn ein Error-Code &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt; ist, aber nach einem Funktionsaufruf der Error-Code nicht geprüft wird,
dann brennt alles nieder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diese Sorte Fehler wird von Source Code Scannern mit statischem Analyzer nicht immer gefunden,
aber meistens und alle Fälle, wo das nicht passiert, sollten von dem Ding eigentlich als Code Smell angemerkt werden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nun. Leider war &lt;strong&gt;auch vorgestern&lt;/strong&gt; Fortigate Patchday.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fortinet-warns-of-new-fortisiem-rce-bugs-in-confusing-disclosure/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;BleepingComputer schreibt&lt;/a&gt;

:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this instance, due to an issue with the API which we are currently investigating,
rather than an edit, this resulted in two new CVEs being created, duplicates of the original CVE-2023-34992,
FortiNet told BleepingComputer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it turns out that CVE-2024-23108 and CVE-2024-23109 are actually patch bypasses for the CVE-2023-34992
flaw discovered by Horizon3 vulnerability expert Zach Hanley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das war also ein Patch für einen Patch, weil die Mitigation nicht funktioniert hat und
Fortinet kam mit den CVE-Nummern durcheinander, weil gerade so viele davon offen sind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unterdessen fordert die US CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) von allen US-Institutionen das
Abschalten von Ivanti VPN (vormals Juniper Pulse Secure):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/schlangenoel-03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;CISA is requiring all Federal agencies to disconnect Ivanti products by Friday at midnight
(Ivanti Connect Secure &amp;amp; Ivanti Policy Secure).
This is roughly 48-hours notice, to not patch, but rip it out!
Ivanti is an American company.
This is unprecedented.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Während man
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/supplemental-direction-v1-ed-24-01-mitigate-ivanti-connect-secure-and-ivanti-policy-secure&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;die Originaldirektive&lt;/a&gt;


ursprünglich noch als Update und Reinstallation sowie Neukonfiguration lesen konnte
hat sich diese Hoffnung mittlerweile zerschlagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Patches, von denen dort die Rede ist, sind nicht geeignet, den Fehler zu beheben.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://infosec.exchange/@briankrebs/111863433959430768&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Brian Krebs hat das zusammengefasst&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unterdessen hat jemand das Ivanti Image mal aufgemacht und reingesehen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/schlangenoel-04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Versionen von Software, die routinemäßig seit mehr als einer Dekade veraltet sind in einem aktuellen Image.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das sind, wie curl-Entwickler Stefan Eissing formuliert &amp;ldquo;Leichenteile und Zombie Software&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Und, es kommt, wie es kommen muss:
Einige Tage nach der von CISA vorgeschriebenen Patchorgie
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ivanti-patch-new-connect-secure-auth-bypass-bug-immediately/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;titelt BleepingComputer erneut&lt;/a&gt;

:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ivanti: Patch new Connect Secure auth bypass bug immediately&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flaw (CVE-2024-22024) is due to an XXE
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;XML eXternal Entities&lt;/a&gt;

) weakness in the gateways&amp;rsquo; SAML component
that lets remote attackers gain access to restricted resources on unpatched appliances in low-complexity
attacks without requiring user interaction or authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAML, Security Assertion Markup Language, ist eine XML-Notation für Zugriffsrechte in Single-Sign-On Systemen.
Weil es eine XML-Notation ist, kann es dort diese &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;blablub;&lt;/code&gt;-Dinger geben – Entities – die durch anderen Text ersetzt werden.
Bei External Entities liegt der Ersetzungstext nicht lokal fest, sondern wird aus dem Netz nachgeladen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was heißt das im Kontext von SAML? Es bedeutet, die Zugriffsrechte sind im Dokument also nicht zwingend festgenagelt,
sondern ein Angreifer kann Entity Definitionen aus dem Netz nachladen.
Je nachdem, wo die Entity verwendet wird, kann man damit die SAML-Datei in Teilen oder ganz umschreiben und sich andere Rechte geben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XML-Parser sind gut verstanden und XEE sind ein Ding, auf das man mit einem Sourcecode-Scanner zuverlässig automatisch scannen kann.
Diese Sorte Fehler ist in modernen Entwicklungsumgebungen gut auszuschließen.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist alles keine Ausnahme und auch nicht auf VPN-Gateways beschränkt,
sondern Hersteller von Security Software setzen fröhlich auf
&amp;ldquo;Security-Relevante Software mit Privilegien, und Programmiermethoden aus den 90er Jahren des letzten Jahrtausends&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beispiele aus diesem Blog:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2017/10/20/aslr.html&#34;&gt;ASLR&lt;/a&gt;

: MacOS Trend Micro Binary mit ohne ASLR, jeder Exploit
(ja, es gibt welche) ist automatisch stabil über die ganze Flotte.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2018/06/18/websense-dlp-gives-instant-root.html&#34;&gt;Websense DLP gives instant root&lt;/a&gt;

:
WebSense DLP veraltete Softwareversionen und exploitbares Kernelmodul, vermutlich fehlende QA und defekter Shipping Prozess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist bei Endpoint Security so verbreitet, daß zum Beispiel
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mastodon.social/@joxean&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;@joxean&lt;/a&gt;

 ein ganzes Buch darüber geschrieben hat:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/Antivirus-Hackers-Handbook-English-ebook/dp/B014MJ6AKS&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Antivirus Hacker&amp;rsquo;s Handbook&lt;/a&gt;

.
beschreibt, wie man Sicherheitslücken dieser Art in jeder, wirklich jeder AV Software findet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist systematisch:
Es liegt an der der Art und Weise, wie diese Software designt und entwickelt wird,
und es ist auch mit Patchs nicht zu beheben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ich weiß das, weil ich dieses Spiel einige Jahre mit einem Firmen-Mac gespielt habe:
Ich habe die sogenannten &amp;ldquo;Security Tools&amp;rdquo; verwendet, die Corp auf meinem Mac installiert, um auf meinem Mac Privilegien zu bekommen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der ganze Prozess ist zuverlässig wiederholbar,
und ich habe in keinem Fall mehr als einen langsamen Freitagnachmittag dafür investieren müssen.
Dabei bin ich noch nicht einmal &amp;ldquo;Security-Researcher&amp;rdquo;,
sondern nur ein Amateur mit Reverse-Engineering Erfahrung aus dem C64-Zeitalter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es ist diese Software, die angeblich schützen soll, die am Ende dazu führt, daß der Rechner angreifbar wird.
Wenn jemand wie Fefe von &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.fefe.de/?q=Schlangen&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Schlangenöl&lt;/a&gt;

 redet, dann ist das wortwörtlich zu verstehen.&lt;/p&gt;

 is a term used to describe deceptive marketing,
health care fraud, or a scam.
Similarly, snake oil salesman is a common label used to describe someone who sells, promotes,
or is a general proponent of some valueless or fraudulent cure, remedy, or solution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Eine Problemliste und veraltete Prozesse
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir reden hier von kritisch security-relevanter Software,
die das Eindringen von Schadsoftware und Angreifern auf Rechnern verhindern soll,
oder die solche Angriffe erkennen soll,
oder die Authentisierung oder sonst eine Form von sicherheitsrelevanter Funktion hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sie läuft an kritischer Stelle, oft mit Privilegien und wenn sie versagt, ist meist nicht nur eine Maschine,
sondern eine ganze Firma kritisch exponiert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solche Software sollte eigentlich mit Werkzeugen und Methoden, die Stand der Technik sind, entwickelt werden
und besonderer Beobachtung hinsichtlich Korrektheit, Fehlerfreiheit und Aktualität von Dependencies unterliegen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir sehen jedoch Fehler, die auf Defizite im Entwicklungsprozeß an allen Stellen schließen lassen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wir sehen kritische Fehler, die keine groß problematischen Auswirkungen haben müßten,
wenn die Software von vorher herein rechteminimal geschrieben worden wäre.
Aber Parser für komplexe, unbekannte Datenformate, die potenziell bösartige Payloads enthalten,
mit Privilegien laufen zu lassen?
Und dann noch elementare Sicherheitsmechanismen des Betriebssystems abschalten?
Das bedeutet, sich für Maximalschaden aufzustellen.
Es ist keine gewinnbare Position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Das alles in 2024 in C zu tun, wenn man Go oder Rust zur Verfügung hätte?
Auch nicht sonderlich schlau.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seine Deliverables mit Software vollzupacken, die im Fall von Ivanti bis zu zwei Dekaden
ohne Patches auf dem Buckel hat, anstatt einen automatisierten Release-Prozess zu haben, der ein neues
Release aus den neusten Versionen von allem zusammenschraubt und automatisch testet?
Das ist nicht nur &amp;ldquo;nicht Stand der Technik&amp;rdquo;, sondern es ist grob fahrlässig.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Das alles dann in einem verschlüsselten Image auszuliefern, statt mit einer &amp;ldquo;SBOM of Shame&amp;rdquo;
(Software Bill Of Materials, eine Liste der verwendeten Dependencies und ihrer Versionen)
ist bald schon ein Federal Crime in den USA, und auch die EU ist auf diesem Weg.
Gut so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ein &amp;ldquo;Format String Bug&amp;rdquo; oder eine &amp;ldquo;XML External Entities Vulnerability&amp;rdquo; sind triviale Fehler,
die Source Code Scanner erkennen können, wie sie von diesen Securityfirmen selbst beworben
oder gar im eigenen Haus entwickelt werden.
Aber offensichtlich sind diese Werkzeuge im Hause nicht im Einsatz, denn sonst hätte solcher Code niemals in
ein Produkt gelangen können.
Dazu braucht es keine KI, teilweise sind das bessere Regular Expressions, manchmal ein bisschen statische Analyse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir beobachten hier als Außenstehende auf der Grundlage der gezeigten Fehlerbilder ein
Versagen entlang der gesamten Software Development Chain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auf der Architektur-Ebene (nicht rechteminimal),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;auf der Tool-Ebene (keine Scanner für triviale Fehler, veraltete Dependencies, keine Automation beim Build und Release)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;auf der Packaging-Ebene (die defekten Permissions bei Websense zum Beispiel)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;und an jeder anderen Stelle, bei der man von außen durch die Fehler auf den Prozess rückschließen kann.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zum Beispiel &amp;ldquo;kein funktionierender Code-Review und Audit&amp;rdquo;
(&amp;ldquo;statisch einkompilierte Backdoor-Passworte&amp;rdquo;, wie sie bei Cisco das Dauer-Fehlerbild sind, fallen darunter).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es sind mithin Managementfehler bei der Führung von Software-Häusern, die sicherheitskritische Software herstellen.
Es ist Aufgabe des Managements Prozesse einzurichten und zu steuern, die ein Mindestmaß an Qualität sicherstellen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Softwarefehler, kann man nichts machen&amp;rdquo; stimmt so nicht – es gibt ganze Klassen von Fehlern,
die man durch Architektur,
durch automatisches Scannen,
durch Ausbildung,
durch Review,
und durch Testen sicher ausschließen kann,
und es ist die Aufgabe des Managements, solche Prozesse einzurichten und zu steuern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alles in allem kann man nur zu dem Ergebnis kommen,
daß hier verantwortungslose Hackerbuden ohne elementare Software-Entwicklungsprozesse als &amp;ldquo;Security&amp;rdquo;-Firmen auftreten
und radioaktiven Giftmüll in Hochglanzpackungen abfüllen,
um so eine Autobahn für Nation State Actors ins Herz von kritischen Infrastrukturen zu bauen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teilweise grenzt die Art der Fehler an mutwillige Sabotage,
beziehungsweise könnte man es auch mit mutwilliger Sabotage kaum schlimmer machen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;1010-no-notes&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#1010-no-notes&#34;&gt;
	10/10, no notes
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Im Chat witzeln Freunde von mir:
&amp;ldquo;Are you a 10/10 company?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security-Lücken wird nicht nur eine eindeutige Nummer zugewiesen, die CVE-Nummer, sondern
sie bekommen auch einen Schweregrad, den &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerability_Scoring_System&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CVSS-Score&lt;/a&gt;

.
Eine 10/10 ist der Maximalgrad, aber im Grunde ist alles über 8
ein &lt;a href=&#34;https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Totalschaden und komplettes Prozessversagen&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es gibt nun eine historische CVE-Datenbank, die man
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/cvssscoremin-9/cvssscoremax-10/vulnerabilities.html?page=1&amp;amp;cvssscoremin=9&amp;amp;cvssscoremax=10&amp;amp;order=3&amp;amp;trc=40515&amp;amp;sha=2721cbf47ba1e57d8b65ae1c3cf8883295fd04d7&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;nach CVSS sortieren kann&lt;/a&gt;

,
und auch auf Firmen wie
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-3080/Fortinet.html?page=1&amp;amp;cvssscoremin=9&amp;amp;order=3&amp;amp;trc=103&amp;amp;sha=0ba96ce0b5ea0195196988ef1d381bdd33622c49&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Fortinet einschränken&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir sehen dann für Fortinet eine Reihe von 12 Fehlern mit 10/10, und zwar
2x in 2024, 1x in 2021, 1x in 2019, 3x in 2017, 4x in 2016 und einmal in 2005.
Das kann man auch mit &amp;ldquo;Besserung ist nicht erkennbar&amp;rdquo; zusammenfassen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Security ist ein Prozess&amp;rdquo; heißt es.
Für Business Continuity Management habe ich einmal aufgeschrieben, was das bedeutet:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/02/18/this-is-not-a-drill.html&#34;&gt;This is not a Drill. This is just Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analoge Überlegungen kann man auch für sichere Software-Entwicklungsprozesse anstellen,
und es gibt sogar fertige Prozess-Blueprints dafür.
Weiterhin kann man, wie ich gezeigt habe, an den Fehlerbildern erkennen, welche Schwächen der interne Entwicklungsprozess
hinsichtlich Security Best-Practices hat,
und an den CVE-Anzahlen und CVSS-Scores erkennen, ob eine Firma ihre Posture verbessert hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenn das erkennbar über Jahre nicht der Fall ist, wie kann dann eine Kaufentscheidung positiv beschieden werden?
Denkt mal darüber nach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/meerschweinchen-anne.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manche Dinge sind nur durch niedliche Meerschweinchenfotos erträglich zu machen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wie ChatGPT funktioniert</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2024/02/06/wie-chatgpt-funktioniert.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2024 01:02:03 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2024/02/06/wie-chatgpt-funktioniert.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Es gibt einen wunderbaren Artikel von Stephen Wolfram,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;What Is ChatGPT Doing … and Why Does It Work?&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dies ist ein etwa ein Jahr alter und langer Text, und man muss dran bleiben, wenn man ihn verstehen möchte.
Er erklärt wie ChatGPT intern funktioniert, warum das so viel Ressourcen kostet,
und er erklärt auch, daß wir keine Ahnung haben, wieso das &amp;ldquo;funktioniert&amp;rdquo;.
Er zeigt aber auch, was ChatGPT alles prinzipbedingt niemals erreichen kann, und auch nicht lernen wird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;What is ChatGPT doing…&lt;/a&gt;


von Stephen Wolfram vom 14. Februar 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Wolfram ist ein Informatiker und Physiker,
der einen recht guten Prolog-Interpreter mit Regeln zur Termumformung und Fakten gefüttert hat,
und dies unter dem Namen Mathematica vertreibt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prolog ist eine deklarative Sprache, die vor 30 Jahren die Grundlage regelbasierter künstlicher Intelligenz-Forschung war.
Deklarative Sprachen wie SQL oder Prolog schreiben keine Programme, die dem Computer sagen, was zu tun ist,
sondern sie beschreiben das gewünschte Ergebnis.
Ein Programmgenerator, der Planer, versucht dann einen Ausführungspfad zu finden,
der das beschriebene Ergebnis auf eine effiziente Weise findet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Idee hinter diesem Ansatz in der KI-Forschung war, daß man die Welt regelbasiert beschreiben könnte,
ein Welt-Wissensmodell bauen und daß so &amp;ldquo;Intelligenz&amp;rdquo; entsteht.
Das war ein Fehlschlag, aber Mathematica ist eines der beeindruckendsten Arbeitssysteme für Mathematik,
Physik-Visualisierung und Modellierung und alle verwandten Arbeiten.
Eine private Lizenz ist teuer, aber ich gönne mir die,
weil es so einen Heidenspaß macht mit dem Ding zu arbeiten und Sachen auszuprobieren.
Rein optisch und von der Arbeitsweise ist Jupyter ein gnadenloser Mathematica-Clone,
aber in Mathematica steckt eine komplett andere Sprache (etwas, das mal ein Prolog war) und eine viel, viel größere Bibliothek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-02.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ein Mathematica Arbeitsblatt, das die Approximation von Rechteckwellen durch Fouriersynthese zeigt,
indem es eine Formelschar generiert und plotted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wir generieren daraus Audio, stellen das Audio dar, und spielen es ab.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wolfram geht in seinem Text auf einen der simpelsten Textgeneratoren ein (und zeigt, wie man ihn in Mathematica realisiert) –
ein Zeichenfrequenz-Zähler, der Wikipedia-Seiten konsumiert und zeigt,
wie oft (normiert, also in %) jeder Buchstabe in der Seite auftaucht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Er vergleicht die Seiten von &amp;ldquo;Cat&amp;rdquo; und &amp;ldquo;Dog&amp;rdquo; und zeigt, daß in der &amp;ldquo;Dog&amp;rdquo;-Seite natürlich die o-Wahrscheinlichkeit höher ist,
aber daß beide für Englisch charakteristische Buchstabenhäufigkeiten haben.
Er greift sich dann die Häufigkeiten von Buchstabenpaaren (Bi-Grammen) und zeigt an der Spalte für den Buchstaben &amp;ldquo;q&amp;rdquo;,
daß &amp;ldquo;q&amp;rdquo; quasi immer von &amp;ldquo;u&amp;rdquo; gefolgt wird, und man kann das sehen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Waagrecht die ersten Buchstaben von Paaren, senkrecht die zweiten Buchstaben.
Je roter und dunkler das Feld, umso häufiger die Kombination.
Die Spalte &amp;ldquo;q&amp;rdquo; ist ganz weiß, mit Ausnahme der &amp;ldquo;qu&amp;rdquo;-Kombination.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nimmt man mehr Kontext, also statt Paaren Dreiergruppen (Tri-Gramme) oder noch längere Gruppen,
dann bekommt man irgendwann fast aussprechbare oder reale englische Worte.
Schon 4-Gramme produzieren gute Worte.
Englisch hat also einen Buchstabenkontext von circa 4-5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-05.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eine Reihe von Worten, die aus Nachfolgewahrscheinlichkeiten von Bi-, Tri- und n-Grammen erzeugt worden ist.
Ab einer Länge von etwa 4 entstehen oft gültige Worte der englischen Sprache.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Würde man das mit chinesischen Schriftzeichen machen,
bekäme man aus einem Grundwortschatz von einigen tausend Worten auf diese Weise Sätze.
Viele chinesische Begriffe haben ein Schriftzeichen, manche zur Klärung der Bedeutung zwei.
ChatGPT macht das genau so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dort sind es keine Schriftzeichen, sondern Token.
Aber ein Token entspricht ziemlich genau der Funktion, die ein Schriftzeichen in Chinesisch hat.
Und es sind fast genau so viele – in der Größenordnung von Zehntausenden.
Davon sind viele Begriffe Ein-Token und einige Mehr-Token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bigramme auf Token produzieren Dinge wie dies hier: Wortsalat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-06.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eine Reihe von Wortfolgen, die alle zufällig generiert wurden, auf der Basis von Wortfolgewahrscheinlichkeiten,
die über Bi-Grammen, also Wortpaaren, errechnet worden sind.
Alle Beispiel starten mit dem Wort &amp;ldquo;cat&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stellt man mehr Kontext, arbeitet man also mit n-Grammen für n=3, 4, …,
dann bekommt man eher Dinge, die wie korrekte Sätze aussehen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man bekommt auch eine kombinatorische Explosion:
Statt 26, 26*26, 26*26*26, &amp;hellip; Wahrscheinlichkeiten zum Abspeichern hat man jetzt zum Beispiel 40.000 als Basis.
Und bei einem großen Kontext – statt 4 oder 5 eher was bei 100 – hat man dann mit 40.000 hoch 100 zu tun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, nicht – weil man das so nicht verarbeiten kann,
und ein wenig Arbeit in die Speicherung von dünn besetzten Matrizen und große Datenmengen stecken muss.
Aber das ist ein lösbares Problem, auch wenn es Aufwand erfordert, der auf der Mathematik nicht sichtbar ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wolfram erklärt dann &amp;ldquo;Modellierung durch Interpolation&amp;rdquo;.
Er hat Messwerte, die den Weg eines geworfenen Balls durch den Raum beschreiben,
und will dann nacheinander eine Gerade, eine Parabel oder &amp;ldquo;was Kompliziertes&amp;rdquo; da hindurchlegen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Er nutzt dieses Beispiel, um viele Dinge um den Modellbegriff zu erklären:
Einmal gibt es verschiedene Wege, um den Fehler zu messen,
also die Abweichung der interpolierten Linie von den Messwerten zu beschreiben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-07.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Die Messwerte eines Ballwurfes, und die verschiedenen hindurch interpolierten Kurven.
Eine Gerade, eine Parabel und &amp;ldquo;was Kompliziertes&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dann setzt die &amp;ldquo;Beweglichkeit&amp;rdquo; der Funktion, die zur Interpolation genutzt wird, dem Modell Grenzen.
Egal, welche Koeffizienten man findet – die &amp;ldquo;komplizierte&amp;rdquo; Funktion aus dem letzten Beispiel hat immer große Fehler.
Sie kann keinen Fit ergeben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die zweite Funktion, die Parabel, ist immer ein guter Fit.
Das ist so, weil das real-weltliche Phänomen sich aus Gründen tatsächlich parabolisch verhält,
bis es durch Luftwiderstand gestört wird.
In jedem Modell stecken Annahmen – und die können, wenn sie falsch sind, – das Modell unmöglich machen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Er geht dann zu neuronalen Netzen über und diskutiert, wie diese aufgebaut sind,
und welche Mathematik da drin steckt und wofür man sie einsetzen kann.
Es sind Geradengleichungen, mx+b, und Summen, aber sehr, sehr viele.
Sein Beispiel ist die Schrifterkennung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-08.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ein Datentyp in Mathematica sind zweidimensionale Bitmaps – Bilder.
Hier sind es handgeschriebene Ziffern.
Man kann diese in eine Menge (einen weiteren Datentyp) tun, und dann einem NetModel (dem Datentyp für ein Neurales Netz) vorwerfen.
Dieses spezielle NetModel gibt dann als Ausgabe die erkannten Ziffern.
Dies ist eine Anwendung eines NN als Classifier, also als ein Ding, das erkennen und gruppieren kann.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-09.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Auf ein Bitmuster einer gut lesbaren 2 wird sukzessive ein immer stärkerer Gaussian Blur angewendet.
Die resultierende Eingabemenge wird in das NetModel-Objekt verfüttert und man bekommt &amp;ldquo;2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1&amp;rdquo; als Ausgabe.
Das Modell bricht bei schlechten Daten irgendwann zusammen.
Als Mensch erkennt man mehr Ziffern korrekt als 2, aber am Ende wird es wirklich sehr unlesbar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wolfram macht dann weiter und diskutiert das Konzept der Nähe oder Ähnlichkeit, indem er mit Voronoi-Maps herumexperimentiert.
Er stellt sich jetzt die Aufgabe, eine bestimmte Funktion mit zwei Parametern x und y, die die Werte -1, 0 und +1 liefert,
zu &amp;ldquo;lernen&amp;rdquo; und durch ein neuronales Netz zu produzieren.
Er benutzt das, um zu zeigen, wie man Koeffizienten einer Näherungsfunktion findet,
indem man simple Geradengleichungsrechner (Neuronen) verknüpft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-10.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Von einem NN erkannte handgeschriebene Ziffern nach Ähnlichkeit sortiert und angeordnet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-11.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eine Reihe von zufällig auf einer Ebene verteilte Punkte und die von ihnen &amp;ldquo;beherrschten&amp;rdquo; Gebiete:
Jeder Punkt der Ebene wird dem orangen Punkt zugeordnet, der ihm nach irgendeiner Distanzmetrik am nächsten ist.
Es entsteht eine Partition, eine Aufteilung, der Karte in Zonen um die Punkte.
Es sieht aus wie Seifenblasen, die aneinander kleben und gerade Schnittflächen bilden.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-12.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Die Aufgabe: Ein simples Voronoi, das drei Punkte mit den Werten +1, 0 und -1 auf einer Ebene verteilt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-13.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Die 3D-Darstellung desselben Diagramms.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Er nimmt dann die vorherigen Gedanken zur Interpolation wieder auf.
Dazu erfindet er ohne weitere Erläuterung eine Aneinanderreihung von &amp;ldquo;Neuronen&amp;rdquo;, schreibt Koeffizienten dran,
und diskutiert verschiedene mögliche Abstandsberechnungsfunktionen (Fehler-Meßfunktionen).
Wenn man die Mathematik und den Prozess der Suche nach den passenden Koeffizienten mal wegläßt,
kommt man am Ende bei einer Näherung des Wunsch-Graphen an, die so aussieht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-14.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Das von Wolfram gewählte neuronale Netz.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-16.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Das Resultat weicht vom Wunschergebnis ab, ist aber eine gute Näherung.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Er diskutiert und demonstriert dann durch Simulation, daß man bestimmte Dinge nicht darstellen kann,
wenn man nicht genügend Neuronen hat.
Das zu modellierende Subjekt ist zu kompliziert, sodaß der mögliche Parameterraum nicht groß genug ist:
Eine Gerade kann keine Parabel annähern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-16.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verschiedene NN und die resultierenden Näherungen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es geht dann in einen längeren Exkurs, in dem er die Anatomie der Netze zu erklären, die da verwendet werden.
Man erkennt, daß die Modelle Schichten haben und daß sie keine Rückflüsse haben:
Daten fließen immer von der oberen Schicht in die unmittelbar darunter liegende – es gibt keine Rückflüsse und auch kein Überspringen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man erkennt auch, daß generell größere Modelle bessere Ergebnisse liefern.
Wolfram gibt zu, daß wir nicht wissen, wie groß ein NN für ein bestimmtes Problem sein muss.
Wir wissen auch nicht, wie die konkrete Verschaltung der Schichten aussehen sollte,
oder muss, um gute Ergebnisse zu liefern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Er versucht immerhin, die Inhalte der Schichten zu verstehen und ihnen Bedeutung zuzuweisen,
aber auch das ist nicht wirklich Wissenschaft und teilweise Kaffeesatzlesen.
Fast alles am Bau von NN ist &amp;ldquo;Erfahrung&amp;rdquo; und &amp;ldquo;Empirik&amp;rdquo; ohne viel Theorie dahinter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir können Daten aus Schichten von NN herausziehen und sie nach einer Abstandsfunktion sortieren lassen,
und die Anordnung ergibt für unsere menschlichen Hirne irgendwie Sinn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-18.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hunde und Katzenbilder nach einer Abstandsfunktion eines NN sortiert.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir können auch die Neuronen einiger Schichten nehmen, die Koeffizienten in einer Bildmatrix anordnen,
und bekommen vereinfachte Bilder von den Dingen, die da gespeichert oder erkannt werden sollen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aber wir haben keine Funktionstheorie oder Mathematik von NN und Kognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-19.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aus einer Schicht aus dem NN eines Katzen-Hunde-Sortierers herausgezogene Daten ergeben Katzenbilder.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wolfram beschäftigt sich weiter mit dem Training von NN, der Datenbeschaffung und der Auszeichnung von Daten.
Das Korpus von Trainingsdaten muss groß und zuverlässig ausgezeichnet sein.
Wir brauchen also viele Katzenbilder (Dafür gibt es das Internet!) und Hundebilder,
und diese müssen von Menschen korrekt mit Tags versehen worden sein, damit ein NN das lernen kann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Er zeigt dann Verbesserungen der Koeffizienten und der Resultate über Iterationen des Lernprozesses.
&amp;ldquo;Lernen&amp;rdquo; bedeutet für ein NN, die Koeffizienten der verschiedenen Neuronen zu verändern.
Dazu nimmt man die Eingabe-Koeffizienten als &amp;ldquo;Ebene&amp;rdquo; und den Fehler als &amp;ldquo;Höhe&amp;rdquo;
und wandert dann in der so entstehenden Fehlerlandschaft auf einem zufälligen Pfad in die Täler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das findet lokale Minima und man hofft, aus &amp;ldquo;lokalen Löchern&amp;rdquo; zu entkommen, indem man zufällige Schritte zufälliger Größen macht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-20.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Die Berg- und Tallandschaft des Fehlergraphen und der Weg des Modells zum lokalen Minimum.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wieder diskutiert Wolfram mögliche Layouts von NN –
nicht immer kann man jedes Neuron mit allen Neuronen der nächsten Lage verschalten und in der Tat ist das bei großen NN nie machbar.
Bestimmte Formen haben sich als besser lernfähig erwiesen:
Ein schmaler Layer der zwischen zwei breite Layers eingefügt wird scheint Ergebnisse stark zu verbessern.
Niemand weiß, warum das so ist oder hat ein Modell, das dies erklärt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-21.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verschiedene Formen von NN und die Ergebnisse, die sie produzieren.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Etwa in der Mitte des Textes wendet sich Wolfram generativen Modellen und LLMs zu.
Training von LLMs ist sehr, sehr einfach, weil sie einfach Text essen:
Man nimmt beliebigen Text, lässt das Modell das folgende Wort generieren und vergleicht es mit dem Wort, das hätte kommen müssen.
Daraus kann man Trainingsfeedback erzeugen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-22.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eine Karte, auf der englische Worte nach Ähnlichkeit angeordnet sind.
Säugetiere sind links oben, links unten sind &amp;ldquo;alligator&amp;rdquo; und &amp;ldquo;crocodile&amp;rdquo; dicht beieinander, &amp;ldquo;ant&amp;rdquo; und &amp;ldquo;bee&amp;rdquo; sind es auch.
Rechts unten Früchte.
Tiere und Früchte sind klar durch einen Graben getrennt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es entsteht dadurch sogar so etwas wie eine Wissens-Karte nach Ähnlichkeits-Metriken.
Das ist nicht so, weil das LLM ein Weltmodell hat.
Sondern es ist so, weil Menschen ein Weltmodell haben und wenn sie Worte gebrauchen,
bestimmte Worte &amp;ldquo;nach beieinander&amp;rdquo; in Sätzen angeordnet sind.
Ein Weltverständnis entsteht so nicht, ein gewisses Sprachverständnis wohl schon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wieder und wieder und wieder versucht Wolfram zu einem Verständnis der Koeffizienten von LLMs oder NNs zu kommen,
oder zu irgendeiner Theorie, die die Funktionsweise von LLMs und NNs planbar und vorhersagbar macht und sich über pure Empirik erhebt.
Er macht dies mit verschiedenen Visualisierungen von Koeffizienten auf die unterschiedlichsten Weisen,
aber er findet nur quälende Muster, die wie Inhalt wirken und nichts enthüllen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2024/02/chatgpt-23.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eine Vergröberung einer ChatGPT Koeffizientenmatrix und Einfärbung nach bestimmten Werten erzeugt eine interessante Teal-and-Orange Batik,
die nichts bedeutet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am Ende geht es dann darum,
wie man mit solchen riesigen Koeffizienten-Matrizen und einem austrainierten Modell generativ arbeitet und &amp;ldquo;interessante&amp;rdquo; Texte erzeugt.
Dabei geht es auch um den Parameter der &amp;ldquo;Temperatur&amp;rdquo; und den &amp;ldquo;Seed&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Würde man ein generatives LLM mit einer Null-Temperatur laufen lassen,
würde es immer dasselbe, wahrscheinlichste Folgetoken wählen, um einen Satz zu komplettieren.
Indem man die Wahrscheinlichkeiten der Folgetoken sortiert,
und dann zufällig ein anderes wahrscheinliches Token wählt, bekommt man immer noch &amp;ldquo;gültige&amp;rdquo; Fortsetzungen, die aber variabel sind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das Seed ist dabei der Startwert des Pseudo-Zufallszahlen-Generators,
die Temperatur die &amp;ldquo;Sprungweite&amp;rdquo; vom wahrscheinlichsten Wert weg.
Auch hierzu gibt es keine Theorie, wir wissen nur, daß &amp;ldquo;0.8 ein guter Wert ist&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wolfram schließt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So … What Is ChatGPT Doing, and Why Does It Work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic concept of ChatGPT is at some level rather simple.
Start from a huge sample of human-created text from the web, books, etc.
Then train a neural net to generate text that’s “like this.”
And in particular, make it able to start from a “prompt” and then continue with text that’s “like what it’s been trained with”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we’ve seen, the actual neural net in ChatGPT is made up of very simple elements — though billions of them.
And the basic operation of the neural net is also very simple, consisting essentially
of passing input derived from the text it’s generated so far “once through its elements” (without any loops, etc.)
for every new word (or part of a word) that it generates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the remarkable—and unexpected—thing is that this process can produce text that’s successfully “like” what’s out there on the web,
in books, etc.
And not only is it coherent human language, it also “says things” that “follow its prompt” making use of content it’s “read”.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t always say things that “globally make sense”
(or correspond to correct computations because it’s just saying things that “sound right” based on what things “sounded like” in its training material).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist der Stochastische Papagei, von dem bei LLMs gerne mal die Rede ist.
Er ist wortwörtlich gemeint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein LLM reproduziert Versatzstücke aus Texten, die es verarbeitet hat,
auf der Basis von Auftretenswahrscheinlichkeiten von &amp;ldquo;großes n&amp;rdquo;-Grammen von chinesischen Schriftzeichen (&amp;ldquo;Token&amp;rdquo;).
n ist dabei gerne groß zweistellig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein Konzept von Korrektheit gibt es nicht.
Wir wissen auch nicht, wie es das geben kann, denn es gibt keine Theorie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Idee, daß ein LLM in &amp;ldquo;full autopilot&amp;rdquo; Mode irgendwas Funktionales in irgendeiner Gesellschaft leisten kann – Arbeiten kann – ist lächerlich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Es reproduziert und würfelt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Es hat kein Weltmodell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Es kennt keine Grenzen in den Termen von Ethik, Moral, Physik oder Logik.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Es reiht nur Token aneinander.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein LLM kann Menschen Arbeit abnehmen, indem es bestimmte Standardfunktionen erleichtert,
und es ist wahrscheinlich ein ausgezeichneter Sprachübersetzer,
und sicher ein wunderbarer Imitator, denn das ist, als was es konstruiert ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aber Imitation schafft nicht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Redewendung des &amp;ldquo;Blurry JPEG of the Internet&amp;rdquo; ist wieder exakt zutreffend,
denn das ist, was der Konstruktionsprozeß eines LLM produziert – eine verlustbehaftete Kompression von Wort-Folge-Wahrscheinlichkeiten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In meiner beruflichen Karriere habe ich um mich herum eine Reihe von KI-Projekten in kommerzieller Anwendung gelingen und scheitern sehen.
Das Muster, daß sich dabei ergeben hat, bestätigt sich auch bei LLMs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wann immer meine Arbeitgeber KI eingesetzt haben, um Menschen full-auto zu ersetzen ist das Projekt ein unmitigiertes Desaster gewesen,
das der Firma geschadet und den Kunden Leid zugefügt hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wann immer meine Arbeitgeber KI eingesetzt haben um Menschen zu augmentieren war das Projekt eine Effizienzsteigerung
um eine halbe Größenordnung (den Faktor 3-5), die durch Feedback menschlicher Entscheidungen in den Trainingskorpus noch verbessert werden konnte.
Dabei war oft entscheidend, Confidence-Werte (aus der Modell-Fehler-Metrik abgeleitete Werte) herauszuführen und für Menschen sichtbar zu machen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Grundidee dahinter ist, daß wir eine Maschine bauen, die wir zwingen eine Entscheidung zu treffen, egal wie groß die Fehlermetrik ist.
Wenn die Maschine sich sicher ist, daß ein Standardfall in einer oder ander Weise vorliegt, ist das wahrscheinlich gut.
Wenn die Maschine aber eine hohe Fehlermetrik anzeigt, dann erzwingen wir eine Entscheidung, die wahrscheinlich zufällig ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hier ist es gut, den Fall herauszunehmen und Menschen vorzulegen.
Anders als die KI haben diese ein Weltmodell, und insbesondere ein Modell der ganzen Welt inklusive all der Informationsquellen,
Kontexte und Eskalationsstufen, die dem KI-Modell nicht zugänglich sind.
Menschen können Dinge auf Weisen kontextualisieren und umordnen, die einem Reproduktions-Papagei nicht möglich sind.
Und diese Menschen sind glücklicher, schneller und effektiver, wenn sie mit den Standardfällen nichts zu tun haben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir können KI erfolgreich einsetzen, wenn wir es nach diesem Modell tun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir können die Hölle auf Erden erschaffen, indem wir Menschen einer unkontrollierten Papagei-KI aussetzen,
die nach zufällig aufgerufenen Reproduktionen vorheriger Fälle entscheidet, ohne Ausweg.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sitzende Tätigkeit</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/10/10/sitzende-taetigkeit.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 02:03:04 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/10/10/sitzende-taetigkeit.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ich arbeite im Sitzen, 8h am Tag beruflich, und dann noch ein wenig mehr aus Spaß:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2022/02/21/spaces.html&#34;&gt;Spaces&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ich habe meinen eigenen Platz daheim, immer schon gehabt.
Das habe ich von meinem Vater gelernt, der Amateurfunker war und daheim seinen höchst eigenen Bastel- und Arbeitsplatz hatte,
seinen Ort und Rückzugplatz.
Zu einem ordentlichen Arbeitsplatz gehört auch ein Sitz.
Der Sitz ist ein Arbeitsgerät und da sollte man angesichts der Anzahl der darin verbrauchten Stunden nicht kaspern, sondern klotzen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meinen alten Stuhl habe ich 2003 in Karlsruhe gekauft, ein Dauphin Shape Comfort XT mit nahezu allen Optionen.
Der hat 20 Jahre gehalten.
Aber inzwischen wurde es Zeit für einen Ersatz:
Nicht nur ist die Gasdruckfeder im Eimer (die habe ich schon einige Male getauscht, sicher ist sicher),
sondern intern ist die Mechanik auch abgenudelt und verschiedene Einstellmöglichkeiten haben nicht mehr gut funktioniert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andererseits: 20 Jahre.
Das Teil hat in Karlsruhe, 2 Orten in Berlin, und in Amsterdam Dienst getan.
Dann ist auch gut.
Hier ist der neue, wieder ein Dauphin Shape XT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/10/sitz-01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anlieferung fertig montiert in einem sehr stabilen Monsterkarton.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/10/sitz-02.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ausstattung, wie bestellt, via &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.objectservice.de/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://www.objectservice.de/&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Da der Sitz vormontiert bestellt war, gestaltete sich das Auspacken schnell und einfach.
Dachte ich, aber es gab Luftpolsterfolie!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/10/sitz-03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luftpolsterfolie!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Stuhl kommt mit einem ausführlichen Handbuch und einer Erklärung der Grundlagen der Ergonomie.
Das braucht es auch, denn dies ist ein richtiger Bürostuhl,
und kein Gamer-Stuhl oder gar, wie einige Kollegen auch im Jahr 3 der Pandemie, ein Küchenstuhl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/10/sitz-04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bild des Bürostuhls am Arbeitsort: Höhenverstellbarer Schreibtisch, jede Menge Strom, eine Rollmatte und ein ordentlicher Stuhl.
Tageslicht von Links.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Stuhl kommt mit einer Vielzahl an Einstellmöglichkeiten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/10/sitz-05.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Übersicht der Einstellmöglichkeiten.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sitzhöhe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sitztiefe. Die Sitzfläche gleitet nach vorn, und ich passe auf den Stuhl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Armlehnen weit ausfahren: Ein wichtiger Handgriff, damit mein breiter Hintern in den Sessel passt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rückenlehne fixieren oder losdrehen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wenn man 4 losmacht, kann man Einstellen, wie stark die Rückenlehne Gegendruck macht.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nicht sichtbar: Armlehnen Höhe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lordosenstütze Höhe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Die Rückenlehne ist höhenverstellbar, und das ist so auch notwendig bei mir.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rückenlehne und Sitzfläche neigen sich zusammen nach vorne und hinten (&amp;ldquo;Synchromechanik&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es gibt noch besser ausgestattete Versionen von diesem Stuhl,
bei denen die Armlehnen auch in Neigung und Winkel verstellbar in mehreren Dimensionen sind,
aber das ist meiner Erfahrung nach nicht dringend.
Eine Version mit Nackenstütze ist auch zu haben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bezüge kommen in mehreren Preiskategorien (bis &amp;ldquo;Chefsessel Leder&amp;rdquo;) und sind auf Beanspruchung ausgelegt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zum Einstellen kann man einfach die Anleitung im Handbuch befolgen.
Die Schritte sind im Grunde bei jedem Stuhl dieselben, sofern die betreffenden Einstellmöglichkeiten vorhanden sind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Die Synchronmechanik und andere Schwingteile blockieren (z.B. die Rückenlehne aufrecht fixieren) und die Armlehnen ausfahren auf maximale Breite.
Das macht Platz im Stuhl und erzeugt eine neutrale Sitzposition. Hinsetzen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sitzhöhe einstellen. Füße platt auf den Boden, dann müssen die Oberschenkel waagrecht im 90 Grad Winkel stehen.
Manche Menschen wollen die Sitzhöhe noch ein wenig höher haben.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sitztiefe einstellen, also die Sitzfläche so weit ausfahren, daß sie bis auf 2-3 Finger an die Kniekehlen heranreicht und die Beine unterstützt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nun die Position der Rückenlehne einstellen: Neigung, und wenn höhenverstellbar auch Höhe, bis die Unterstützung im Kreuz angenehm ist.
Eventuell vorhandene Lordosenstütze in die richtige Position (über dem Becken ins Kreuz) bringen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jetzt Sitzflächenneigung einstellen, also die Synchro loslösen und schaukeln, dann in einer angenehmen Position fixieren,
und danach die Rücken-Neigung noch mal nachstellen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Armlehnen einstellen - Breite, Höhe, Position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Danach Feineinstellung justieren: Synchro los, und Rückenlehnen-Gegendruck anpassen, Lordosenstütze Druck einstellen
und was sonst noch an Hilfseinstellungen da ist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zentral sind Höhe, Sitztiefe und Stellung der fixierten Rückenlehne in Neigung und Höhe der Lordosenstütze.
Der Rest ist dann drumherum zu arrangieren.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Flugtaxi</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/09/18/flugtaxi.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 02:03:04 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/09/18/flugtaxi.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Golem schreibt: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.golem.de/news/urban-air-mobility-ueber-200-skydrive-lufttaxis-vorbestellt-2309-177728.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Über 2000 Skydrive-Lufttaxis vorbestellt&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das eVTOL Skydrive ist 13 x 13 Meter groß und 3 Meter hoch.
Angetrieben wird es von zwölf Elektropropellern, die auf einem Gestell angebracht sind, ähnlich wie bei den Volocoptern.
In dem eVTOL ist Platz für drei Personen: zwei Passagiere und eine, die es fliegt.
Die Fluggeräte, die später ohne Pilot fliegen sollen, können auf einer relativ kleinen Fläche senkrecht starten und landen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;und&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urban Air Mobility (UAM) ist eine neue Form der Luftfahrt:
Passagiere sollen mit Lufttaxis oder Taxidrohnen kürzere oder mittlere Strecken in der Stadt zurücklegen.
Dadurch, dass ein Teil des Verkehrs in die Luft verlagert wird, sollen die Straßen weniger belastet werden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lärm&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#l%c3%a4rm&#34;&gt;
	Lärm
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hier ist ein Video von einem Vorläufer dieses Modells, von 2020.
Der Soundtrack ist wichtig:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yc2L5koWZY&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/09/flugtaxi-01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skydrive Piloted Flight Demo.
SkyDrive performed the first public flight demonstration of its SD-03 eVTOL on Aug. 25, 2020
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yc2L5koWZY&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Video&lt;/a&gt;

)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beim Deutschlandfunk Nova heißt es zum selben Problemkomplex:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.deutschlandfunknova.de/nachrichten/drohnen-wenn-die-kettensaege-kommt&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Drohnen: Wenn die Kettensäge kommt&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Drohnen werden aber nicht nur Päckchen bringen, sondern vor allem Lärm.
Kommerzielle Drohnen, die Lasten transportieren, sind deutlich lauter als kleine Kameradrohnen.
Je schwerer das Päckchen, desto lauter.
Der Lärmpegel ist vergleichbar mit Laubsaugern, Rasenmähern und Kettensägen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;und&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Videos, die die Lieferdrohnen bewerben, sind gerne mit Musik unterlegt, das Drohnengeräusch ist nicht zu hören.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;downwash&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#downwash&#34;&gt;
	Downwash
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein anderer Effekt von Rotorflüglern jeder Art ist Newtons Gesetz:
Jede Kraft erzeugt eine gleiche, entgegengesetzte Gegenkraft.
Wenn ein Flugtaxi also bei Erdanziehung 1250 kg Schub aufwärts erzeugt, dann muß es auch einen 1250 kg Downwash geben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.ivao.aero/en/home/training/documentation/Ground_effect&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/09/flugtaxi-02.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luftströme am Rotorflügler, in der Luft (&amp;ldquo;out of ground effect&amp;rdquo;) und in Bodennähe (&amp;ldquo;in ground effect&amp;rdquo;).
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.ivao.aero/en/home/training/documentation/Ground_effect&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ausführliche Erläuterungen&lt;/a&gt;

)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In der Luft befindet sich unter einem Rotorflügler ein Abwindkorridor, dem andere Flieger fern bleiben müssen.
Nahe dem Grund können Sand, Schnee oder Steine aufgewirbelt werden (Brownout, Whiteout).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In
&lt;a href=&#34;https://jjryan.com.au/index.php/helicopter-rotor-downwash-excessive-wind-fod-and-brownouts-what-are-the-risks/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Helicopter Rotor Downwash – Excessive wind, FOD and brownouts, what are the risks?&lt;/a&gt;


haben wir eine bildliche Darstellung von Downwash und auch eine Tabelle von Mindestabständen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/09/flugtaxi-03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beispiele für Helicopter Rotor Downwash.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generell werden 3-5 Rotordurchmesser als sicherer Abstand zu einem landenden oder startenden Helikopter genannt.
Dies gilt für Personen, aber auch andere am Grund parkende Fluggeräte
oder andere Gegenstände mit einer großen Angriffsfläche für Wind wie etwa belaubte Bäume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bei einem Volocopter mit einer Größe von 13x13 Metern also circa 50 x 50 Meter.
Zum Vergleich: Ein frei stehendes Einzelhaus hat eine Grundfläche von 8x8 Metern, und steht auf einem Grundstück von 12x20 Metern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hier zwei Starts:
der Hubschrauber kann relativ schnell an Höhe gewinnen, weil er nicht in seinen eigenen Downwash fliegt.
Landungen sind wesentlich gemächlicher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJD1xvVC4cA&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/09/flugtaxi-04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;


&lt;em&gt;Start von D-HBLN vom Metzplatz, Berlin vor dem Wenckebach-Krankenhaus. Die Bäume sind unbelaubt.
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJD1xvVC4cA&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Video&lt;/a&gt;

)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur4z1woV0ak&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;


&lt;em&gt;Start eines Rettungshubschraubers von einem Spielplatz in Vijfhuizen, NL.
Die Polizei hat das Gelände abgesperrt, etwa 50-70m Sicherheitsabstand.
Der Downwash schüttelt die belaubten Bäume.
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur4z1woV0ak&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Video&lt;/a&gt;

)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;energieverbrauch&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#energieverbrauch&#34;&gt;
	Energieverbrauch
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schließlich ist noch der Energieverbrauch zu berücksichtigen,
denn anders als Starrflügler können Rotorflügler und Drohnen nicht gleiten.
Sie müssen also jederzeit in der Luft die volle Energie aufwenden, um ihr Gewicht gegen die Gravitation zu halten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dies setzt auch der Reichweite und Flugzeit enge und absolute Grenzen als Funktion der Energiedichte des Treibstoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flugtaxis sind für Verkehrsprobleme was Kernfusion für Energieprobleme ist.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Der Fusionsenergie könnte in den nächsten zehn bis fünfzehn Jahren der entscheidende Durchbruch gelingen,
aber Deutschland schaut nur staunend oder skeptisch zu&amp;rdquo;, kritisierte von Tschirschky.
Deutschland brauche eine Fusionsstrategie für sämtliche Schritte von Lieferketten über Forschungsförderung bis zu Verwaltungsvorschriften.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Golem schreibt:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.golem.de/news/kernfusion-vor-durchbruch-deutschland-fehlt-laut-studie-eine-strategie-dafuer-2309-177715.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Deutschland fehlt laut Studie eine Strategie dafür&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In zehn bis fünfzehn Jahren könnte die Technik für die Stromerzeugung einsatzfertig sein, meint die Unternehmensberatung Strategy&amp;amp;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Studie hätte ich ja gerne mal gesehen.
Denn soweit ich weiß, sind alle bisherigen kontrollierten terrestrischen Fusionen Energie-Negativ gewesen
und haben zudem die unangenehme Eigenschaft, das Reaktorgefäß zu schmelzen, in dem sie stattfinden, würden sie lange genug laufen,
um sinnvoll Energie zu erzeugen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aber schauen wir mal nach der Studie.
Ich habe sie runtergeladen:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.strategyand.pwc.com/de/en/industries/energy-utilities-resources/the-fusion-revolution/strategyand-fusion-energy.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/09/strategyand-fusion-energy.pdf&#34;&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die ist von &amp;ldquo;Strategy&amp;amp;&amp;rdquo;, einer Unternehmensberatung, die 2008 von Booz, Allen &amp;amp; Hamilton an PwC verkauft wurde.
Die Studie malt die üblichen IEA Szenarien für die Energieversorgung der Zukunft auf,
um dann auf eine hätte-könnte-würde Welt umzuschwenken, in der wir auf einmal Kernfusion haben.
Dabei wird in diesen Slides Konjunktiv verwendet, denn es gibt keine dauerhafte existierende Kernfusion in diesem Planetensystem, außer in der Sonne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/09/strategyand-04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;em&gt;Fusion energy may be the missing key to a sustainable, sufficient and affordable energy supply:
Im Jahr 2040 taucht magisch Kernfusion auf, und im Jahr 2050 ersetzt sie komplett und just-in-time die fossile Restenergie.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consultantwitzchen am Rande:
Das Lithium für die Fusion bekommen wir aus recycelten Batterien, hihi!
Eigentlich brauchen wir Deuterium, und Lithium nur als Zwischenschritt für Tritium, aber Witz!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/09/strategyand-05.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;em&gt;Die Zutaten und das Resultat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Zutaten in unserem Fantasiebaukasten sind 100% Buzzword-Compliant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magnets! Superleitend!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quantencomputerz!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Und High Powered Laz0rz!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alles muss unbedingt auf eine einsame Insel mit einem Vulkan, und wir brauchen auch eine weiße Perserkatze!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/09/strategyand-06.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;em&gt;Hier eine technisch aussehende Zeichnung einsetzen, und diesmal nicht wieder eine von diesen Perry-Rhodan Rißzeichnungen, bitte!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Und jetzt bitte: FOMO Alarm! FOMO Alarm! Release the Fördermittelkraken!
Denn: Es ist ein Rennen zwischen den Nationen!
Energy too cheap to meter!
Wir brauchen eine Strategie!
Und Geld!
Viel Geld!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitte stoppt sofort Fernfusion, wir haben bald schon Kernfusion!
Und Perserkatzen mit Lasern!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/09/strategyand-08.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;em&gt;The decisive advantage over existing renewables: Fusion energy is simultaneously base-load capable and easily scalable.
Und der Feenstaubverbrauch ist minimal!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sagte ich: &amp;ldquo;Energy to cheap to meter?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das ist ein verbrannter Begriff aus den 50er Jahren.
Wir haben stattdessen &amp;ldquo;secure and cheap oversupply.&amp;rdquo;
Yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/09/strategyand-09.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;em&gt;The amount of energy from raw materials for fusion available worldwide is sufficient for secure and cheap energy oversupply:
250 Kilo Treibstoff pro Jahr statt ganzer Güterzüge voller herkömmlicher Energieträger.
Oder Berlin-Mitte überdachen.
Halt, was?
Wieso nicht? Eine Solarmall in Mitte kann unsere Energieprobleme auch lösen?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was fehlt denn dann noch für funktionierende Kernfusion?
Naja, im Grunde nix, außer der Technik.
An der wir schon seit 80 Jahren vergeblich herum erfinden.
Aber &lt;em&gt;diesmal&lt;/em&gt; ist es wirklich fast so weit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Großes Unternehmensberaterehrenwort!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/09/strategyand-11.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;em&gt;The remaining challenges until fusion&amp;rsquo;s commercial maturity are expected to be manageable with technology available today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darum dreht jetzt unbedingt die Geldhähne auf,
dann wird unsere Zaubertechnologie die kommende Klimakrise magisch weg putzen,
ohne dass sich irgendjemand umstellen muss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/09/strategyand-15.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;em&gt;What needs to be done now?
A National Fusion Energy Strategy can turn Germany&amp;rsquo;s current position into an agenda for success.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;und&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/09/strategyand-16.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;em&gt;If Germany acts in time, fusion energy has the potential to become a new engine for the German national economy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ergebnis&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#ergebnis&#34;&gt;
	Ergebnis
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ich bin under-fucking-whelmed von allem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also von diesem 18-Seiten-Null-Content Powerpoint,
und hat irgendeiner der anwesenden &amp;ldquo;Journalisten&amp;rdquo;, die die Meldung gedruckt haben, sich den Fetzen auch nur mal kursorisch angesehen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ich sollte mehr Powerpoint machen, die Milliarden wären mein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das Köhntopp Institut für Feenstaub, gebt mir Fördermittel!
Ihr braucht eine Strategie, Leute, sonst wird das nichts,
wenn die Feenstaub-Fässer in meinem Keller überlaufen und das Land mit Wunschpulver überfluten.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>T-Shirts selbst designen</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/08/17/t-shirts-selbst-designen.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Aug 2023 01:02:03 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2023/08/17/t-shirts-selbst-designen.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hier ist ein T-Shirt/Tragetasche Unikat mit einem selbst gemachten Slogan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://xvlt.net/@frainfostudent/110917197522005126&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/08/tasche.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eine Tasche mit Aufdruck, via &lt;a href=&#34;https://xvlt.net/@frainfostudent/110917197522005126&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schon vor vielen Jahren, in Kiel und Karlsruhe, habe ich angefangen, meine T-Shirts drucken zu lassen.
Darauf waren selbstgemachte Slogans oder Grafiken, oder welche, die ich hemmungslos geklaut und verfremdet habe.
Auch heute ist das noch so.
Jeder kann das, es ist gar nicht schwer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man braucht eine Quelle für T-Shirts in Größen, Qualitäten und Farben, die Euch zusagen.
Dazu einen Textslogan oder eine Grafik-Vorlage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;png&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#png&#34;&gt;
	PNG
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bei den Grafiken ist ein PNG mit transparentem Hintergrund von 1000+ Pixel entlang der längeren Kante vollauf ausreichend.
Ein SVG ist manchmal möglich, aber nicht notwendig und als direkte Druckvorlage oft nicht hilfreich.
Das ist so, weil das SVG die verwendeten Zeichensätze und Grafiken nicht unbedingt direkt enthält,
und das SVG dann beim Dienstleister anders dargestellt wird als bei Euch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auch JPG ist nicht hilfreich, weil es nicht transparent sein kann.
Dann wird beim Druck die Hintergrundfarbe auf den Stoff gedruckt, wenn man das gar nicht möchte,
und man bekommt eine 30 cmx20 cm Plastikplatte auf der Brust statt weicher, atmungsaktiver Baumwolle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1000 Pixel bei 72 dpi sind 30+ cm, vollauf formatfüllend auch bei breiter Brust oder großen Brüsten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dienstleister&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#dienstleister&#34;&gt;
	Dienstleister
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ihr braucht außerdem einen &amp;ldquo;Copyshop&amp;rdquo; auf dem Pro-Level, also einen Grafikdienstleister, der so was kann.
In Kiel habe ich im Knooper Weg gegenüber der Humboldt-Schule gewohnt
und ein wenig nach Norden rauf zur damaligen Fachhochschule war an der Ecke ein Druckladen,
der so etwas konnte und auch 3XL Shirts in Qualitäten hatte, die angenehm waren.
(EDIT: Jetzt &lt;a href=&#34;https://maps.app.goo.gl/dN3UZzpiobBmi7x66&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;am Exer&lt;/a&gt;

)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hier in Haarlem habe ich ebenfalls mehrere solche Shops (&lt;a href=&#34;https://tinto.nl/textiel-bedrukken/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tinto&lt;/a&gt;

 et al),
und es gibt natürlich immer spreadshirt.nl und spreadshirt.de, wenn man nicht nach draußen gehen mag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;druck&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#druck&#34;&gt;
	Druck
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Druck kann auf die vordere oder hintere T-Shirt-Seite oder auf die Ärmel.
Jede Stelle, die bedruckt wird, kostet extra – ein doppelseitiges Shirt also deutlich mehr als ein einseitiges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Druck von Bildmotiven und mit Farben ist weniger Haltbar, als Schrift mit dem Einbaufont des Dienstleisters
(also Text mit einem Font von der Maschine, statt Text als Grafik von Euch als PNG),
und binnen 2-3 Jahren regelmäßigen Tragens wird sich die Grafik ablösen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strichdicke spielt eine Rolle.
Ein T-Shirt ist kein Skizzenblock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/08/t-shirt.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ein mehrere Jahre altes Elite Retro-T-Shirt. Die Schrift hat sich gut gehalten, die feine Grafik vom Raumschiff nicht.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nerdläden-in-den-usa&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#nerdl%c3%a4den-in-den-usa&#34;&gt;
	Nerdläden in den USA
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wie dem auch sei:
Es ist viel einfacher, schneller und ökonomisch und ökologisch vorteilhaft,
solche T-Shirts lokal fertigen zu lassen, als sie von irgendeinem US-Dienstleister per Luftfracht zu Euch schicken zu lassen.
Man braucht das PNG und einen lokalen Laden und kein Shirt.
Manche Dienstleister nehmen auch AI oder PSD, weniger SVG oder PDF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es ist wirklich am einfachsten mit einem moderat aufgelöstem PNG.
PSD, AI, SVG und PDF müssen gerendert werden, und dann fehlen Fonts oder so was.
PNG sieht genau so aus wie man das will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;qualitäten&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#qualit%c3%a4ten&#34;&gt;
	Qualitäten
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Und schließlich:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.trigema.de/magazin/grundmaterialien-der-stoffherstellung&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Stoffe&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.trigema.de/magazin/grundbegriffe-der-stoffe/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Qualitäten&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kalani-home.com/de/stoffen/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Andere Quelle&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;auflösungen&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#aufl%c3%b6sungen&#34;&gt;
	Auflösungen
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hier ein Motiv 835 px hoch, und sein Druck, ca. 11 cm hoch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/08/t-shirt-02.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man kann sehen, daß man sich mit der Auflösung ziemlich entspannen kann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hier ein anderes Motiv (1629px breit) und sein Druck:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/08/t-shirt-03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Druckvorlage ist eine Reproduktion: Ich habe vor einigen Jahren ein Barbie &amp;amp; Dragons T-Shirt geschenkt bekommen, aber hatte keine Vorlage.
Im Jahr von Barbie-Film und Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 mußte ich das in frisch haben, also hab ich mir das selbst neu gemacht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/08/t-shirt-04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Das Statistische Bundesamt hat in
&lt;a href=&#34;https://service.destatis.de/bevoelkerungspyramide/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Bevölkerungspyramide&lt;/a&gt;


eine der coolsten Bevölkerungspyramiden, ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/08/deutschland-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://service.destatis.de/bevoelkerungspyramide/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Destatis Bevölkerungspyramide&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per Default sehr ihr Deutschland im Jahre 2022: 20 % Rentner, 19 % Jugendliche, 62 % Erwerbstätige.
Ihr könnt in dem Ding rumklicken, zum Beispiel Euer Geburtsjahr suchen und dann sehen, wie viele Leute aus dem Jahr noch leben.
Man kann die Sprache umschalten, links oben ist ein Schalter für Englisch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indem ihr den Jahresregler verschiebt, seht ihr Bevölkerungspyramiden der Vergangenheit, oder eine simulierte Zukunft.
Die Simulationsparameter kann man rechts oben einstellen und darunter ablesen, was sie bedeuten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2023/08/deutschland-02.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legende und Erklärungen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auch die Altersgruppen kann man umstellen, etwa das Rentenalter hochdrehen.
Die Farbschattierungen sind Männer/Frauenüberschuß: 1.06 Männer pro 1 Frau bei der Geburt, aber Frauen leben länger.
Die Parameter sind Geburtenraten von 1.44, 1.55 und 1.67 (alle niedriger als für Reproduktion notwendig, aber 2.05 ist unrealistisch für Deutschland).
Die Parameter für Lebenserwartung sind 82/86, 84/88, 86/90.
Die Parameter für Zuwanderung sind 180k, 290k und 400k pA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;em&gt;Deutschland 2070.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir sagen &amp;ldquo;Bevölkerungspyramide&amp;rdquo;, aber das ist nur in agrarischen Gesellschaften mit hoher Reproduktion und hoher Sterblichkeit korrekt.
In Deutschland müßte man Bevölkerungsdönerspieß sagen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>fork, exec, wait and exit</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/12/28/fork-exec-wait-and-exit.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Dec 2020 18:25:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/12/28/fork-exec-wait-and-exit.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2007/01/07/fork-exec-wait-und-exit.html&#34;&gt;english version of a 2007 article&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;news:de.comp.os.unix.linux.misc&#34;&gt;de.comp.os.unix.linux.misc&lt;/a&gt;

 somebody asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are commands in a script executed strictly sequentially, that is,
will the next command only be executed when the previous command has
completed, or will the shell &lt;strong&gt;automatically&lt;/strong&gt; start the next command
if the system has spare capacity?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can I change the default behavior - whatever it may be - in any way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are looking into the fine manual, it may explain at some point that the shell starts each command in a separate process. Then you may continue your thought process and ask what that actually means. As soon as you get to this stage, you may want to have a look at the Unix process lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;processes-and-programs&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#processes-and-programs&#34;&gt;
	Processes and programs
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A program in Unix is a sequence of executable instructions on a disk. You can use the command &lt;em&gt;size&lt;/em&gt; to get a very cursory check of the structure and memory demands of the program, or use the various invocations of &lt;em&gt;objdump&lt;/em&gt; for a much more detailed view. The only aspect that is of interest to us is the fact that a program is a sequence of instructions and data (on disk) that may potentially be executed at some point in time, maybe even multiple times, maybe even concurrently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a program in execution is called a process. The process contains the code and initial data of the program itself, and the actual state at the current point in time for the current execution. That is the memory map and the associated memory (check /proc/&lt;em&gt;pid&lt;/em&gt;/maps), but also the program counter, the processor registers, the stack, and finally the current root directory, the current directory, environment variables and the open files, plus a few other things (in modern Linux for example, we find the processes cgroups and namespace relationships, and so on - things became a lot more complicated since 1979).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Unix processes and programs are two different and independent things. You can run a program more than once, concurrently. For example, you can run two instances of the &lt;em&gt;vi&lt;/em&gt; editor, which edit two different texts. Program and initial data are the same: it is the same editor. But the state inside the processes is different: the text, the insert mode, cursor position and so on differ. From a programmers point of view, &amp;ldquo;the code is the same, but the variable values are differing&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A process can run more than one program: The currently running program is throwing itself away, but asks that the operating system loads a different program into the same process. The new program will inherit some reused process state, such as current directories, file handles, privileges and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of that is done in original Unix, at the system level, with only four syscalls:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;exec()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;usermode-and-kernel&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#usermode-and-kernel&#34;&gt;
	Usermode and Kernel
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/prozesswechsel.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Context switching: Process 1 is running for a bit, but at (1) the kernel interrupts the execution and switches to process 2. Some time later, process 2 is frozen, and we context switch back to where we left off with (1), and so on. For each process, this seems to be seamless, but it happens in intervals that are not continous.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever a Unix process does a system call (and at some other opportunities) the current process leaves the user context and the operating system code is being activated. This is privileged kernel code, and the activation is not quite a subroutine call, because not only is privileged mode activated, but also a kernel stack is being used and the CPU registers of the user process are saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the point of view of the kernel function, the user process that has called us is inert data and can be manipulated at will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kernel will then execute the system call on behalf of the user program, and then will try to exit the kernel. The typical way to leave the kernel is through the scheduler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scheduler will review the process list and current situation. It will then decide into which of all the different userland processes to exit. It will restore the chosen processes registers, then return into this processes context, using this processes stack. The chosen process may or may not be the one that made the system call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short: Whenever you make a system call, you may (or may not) lose the CPU to another process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s not too bad, because this other process at some point has to give up the CPU and the kernel will then return into our process as if nothing happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our program is not being executed linearly, but in a sequence of subjectively linear segments, with breaks inbetween. During these breaks the CPU is working on segments of other processes that are also runnable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fork-and-exit&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#fork-and-exit&#34;&gt;
	fork() and exit()
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In traditional Unix the only way to create a process is using the &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; system call. The new process gets a copy of the current program, but new process id (pid). The process id of the parent process (the process that called &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt;) is registered as the new processes parent pid (ppid) to build a process tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the parent process, &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; returns and delivers the new processes pid as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new process also returns from the &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; system call (because that is when the copy was made), but the result of the &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; is 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; is a special system call. You call it once, but the function returns twice: Once in the parent, and once in the child process. &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; increases the number of processes in the system by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every Unix process always starts their existence by returning from a &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; system call with a 0 result, running the same program as the parent process. They can have different fates because the result of the &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; system call is different in the parent and child incarnation, and that can drive execution down different &lt;code&gt;if()&lt;/code&gt; branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34; data-lang=&#34;c&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;cpf&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;cpf&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;unistd.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;cpf&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;stdlib.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;pid_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;pid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running this, we get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;kris@linux:/tmp/kris&amp;gt; make probe1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;cc     probe1.c   -o probe1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;kris@linux:/tmp/kris&amp;gt; ./probe1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;I am the child.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;I am the parent, the child is 16959.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are defining a variable &lt;code&gt;pid&lt;/code&gt; of the type &lt;code&gt;pid_t&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This variable saves the &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; result, and using it we activate one (&amp;ldquo;I am the child.&amp;rdquo;) or the other (&amp;ldquo;I am the parent&amp;rdquo;) branch of an if().&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running the program we get two result lines. Since we have only one variable, and this variable can have only one state, an instance of the program can only be in either one or the other branch of the code. Since we see two lines of output, two instances of the program with different values for &lt;code&gt;pid&lt;/code&gt; must have been running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we called &lt;code&gt;getpid()&lt;/code&gt; and printed the result we could prove this by showing two different pids (change the program to do this as an exercise!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; system call is entered once, but left twice, and increments the number of processes in the system by one. After finishing our program the number of processes in the system is as large as before. That means there must be another system call which decrements the number of system calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This system call is &lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt; is a system call you enter once and never leave. It decrements the number of processes in the system by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt; also accepts an exit status as a parameter, which the parent process can receive (or even has to receive), and which communicates the fate of the child to the parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our example, all variants of the program call &lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt; - we are calling &lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt; in the child process, but also in the parent process. That means we terminate two processes. We can only do this, because even the parent process is a child, and in fact, a child of our shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shell does exactly the same thing we are doing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;bash (16957) --- calls fork() ---&amp;gt; bash (16958) --- becomes ---&amp;gt; probe1 (16958)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;probe1 (16958) --- calls fork() ---&amp;gt; probe1 (16959) --&amp;gt; exit()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;   |
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;   +---&amp;gt; exit()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt; closes all files and sockets, frees all memory and then terminates the process. The parameter of &lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt; is the only thing that survives and is handed over to the parent process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wait&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#wait&#34;&gt;
	wait()
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our child process ends with an &lt;code&gt;exit(0)&lt;/code&gt;. The 0 is the exit status of our program and can be shipped. We need to make the parent process pick up this value and we need a new system call for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This system call is &lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34; data-lang=&#34;c&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;cpf&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;cpf&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;unistd.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;cpf&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;stdlib.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;cpf&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;sys/types.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;cpf&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;sys/wait.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the runtime protocol:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;kris@linux:/tmp/kris&amp;gt; make probe2

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;I am the child.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;I am the parent, the child is 17399.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;I am the child, 10 seconds later.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;End of process 17399: The process ended with exit(0).
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The variable &lt;code&gt;status&lt;/code&gt; is passed to the system call &lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt; as a reference parameter, and will be overwritten by it. The value is a bitfield, containing the exit status and additional reasons explaining how the program ended. To decode this, C offers a number of macros with predicates such as &lt;code&gt;WIFEXITED()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;WIFSIGNALED()&lt;/code&gt;. We also get extractors, such as &lt;code&gt;WEXITSTATUS()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;WTERMSIG()&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt; also returns the pid of the process that terminated, as a function result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt; stops execution of the parent process until either a signal arrives or a child process terminates. You can arrange for a SIGALARM to be sent to you in order to time bound the &lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-init-program-and-zombies&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-init-program-and-zombies&#34;&gt;
	The &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; program, and Zombies
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; with the pid 1 will do basically nothing but calling &lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt;: It waits for terminating processes and polls their exit status, only to throw it away. It also reads &lt;code&gt;/etc/inittab&lt;/code&gt; and starts the programs configured there. When something from &lt;code&gt;inittab&lt;/code&gt; terminates and is set to &lt;code&gt;respawn&lt;/code&gt;, it will be restarted by &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a child process terminates while the parent process is not (yet) waiting for the exit status, &lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt; will still free all memory, file handles and so on, but the &lt;code&gt;struct task&lt;/code&gt; (basically the &lt;code&gt;ps&lt;/code&gt; entry) cannot be thrown away. It may be that the parent process at some point in time arrives at a &lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt; and then we have to have the exit status, which is stored in a field in the &lt;code&gt;struct task&lt;/code&gt;, so we need to retain it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while the child process is dead already, the process list entry cannot die because the exit status has not yet been polled by the parent. Unix calls such processes without memory or other resouces associated &lt;em&gt;Zombies&lt;/em&gt;. Zombies are visible in the process list when a process generator (a forking process) is faulty and does not &lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt; properly. They do not take up memory or any other resouces but the bytes that make up their &lt;code&gt;struct task&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other case can happen, too: The parent process exits while the child moves on. The kernel will set the ppid of such children with dead parents to the constant value 1, or in other words: &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; inherits orphaned processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the child terminates, &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; will &lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt; for the exit status of the child, because that&amp;rsquo;s what &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; does. No Zombies in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we observe the number of processes in the system to be largely constant over time, then the number of calls to &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt; have to balanced. This is, because for each &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; there will be an &lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt; to match and for each &lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt; there must be a &lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt; somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, and in modern systems, the situation is a bit more complicated, but the original idea is as simple as this. We have a clean fork-exit-wait triangle that describes all processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;exec&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#exec&#34;&gt;
	exec()
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; makes processes, &lt;code&gt;exec()&lt;/code&gt; loads programs into processes that already exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34; data-lang=&#34;c&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;cpf&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here the code of &lt;code&gt;probe3&lt;/code&gt; is thrown away in the child process (the &lt;code&gt;perror(&amp;quot;In exec():&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt; is not reached). Instead the running program is being replaced by the given call to &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the protocol we can see the parent instance of &lt;code&gt;probe3&lt;/code&gt; waits for the &lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt;. Since the &lt;code&gt;perror()&lt;/code&gt; after the &lt;code&gt;execl()&lt;/code&gt;is never executed, it cannot be an &lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt; in our code. In fact, &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; ends the process we made with an &lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt; and that is what we receive our exit status from in our parent processes &lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt; call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux uses a generalization of the original Unix &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt;, named &lt;code&gt;clone()&lt;/code&gt;, to create child processes. That is why we do not see &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; in a Linux system to create a child process, but a &lt;code&gt;clone()&lt;/code&gt; call with some parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux also uses a specialized variant of &lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt;, called &lt;code&gt;waitpid()&lt;/code&gt;, to wait for a specific pid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux finally uses the &lt;code&gt;exec()&lt;/code&gt; variant &lt;code&gt;execve()&lt;/code&gt; to load programs, but that is just shuffling the paramters around. At the end of &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; (PID 30048) the process 30025 will wake up from the &lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt; and continue.&lt;/p&gt;

 is the original C-code of the original &lt;code&gt;sh&lt;/code&gt; from 1979, with the &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; system call. Search for &lt;code&gt;case TFORK:&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, check out the programming style of Mr. Bourne - this is C, even if it does not look like it.&lt;/p&gt;

, has a followup article &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2007/01/07/fork-und-exec-vs-createprocess.html&#34;&gt;on Windows CreateProcess()&lt;/a&gt;

, which has not been translated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When implementing &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; in Windows as part of the WSL 1, Microsoft ran into a lot of problems with the syscall, and wrote an article about how they hate it, and why they think their &lt;code&gt;CreateProcessEx()&lt;/code&gt; (in Unix: &lt;code&gt;spawn()&lt;/code&gt;) would be better. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2019/04/fork-hotos19.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;

 makes a number of good points, but is still wrong. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An unexpected pool size increase</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/10/07/an-unexpeced-pool-size-increase.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Oct 2020 14:52:04 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/10/07/an-unexpeced-pool-size-increase.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At work, replication chains have a single primary database node, to which you write, and then multiple replicas, in multiple AZs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what the one sample chain looks like in Orchestrator:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2020/10/mysql-orchestrator.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;instance-918d is the current primary, in the blue AZ. Replicas in orange and green are in other AZs. Blue badges indicate multiple replicas, eg (38) means 38 machines.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you talk to a database, you get two database handles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A write-handle which always points at the primary, here instance-918d currently, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a read-handle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The read-handle should be in the same AZ as your client application, and should be selected randomly from the available replicas for reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have other replicas, for cloning, to make more replicas, and for example time delayed replicas to correct accidental data deletions and other Oopses quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machines that are available for reading are organised in “Pools” per AZ. Many replication chains have only one Pool, “&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;-misc”, but some replication chains also have additional pools for workload isolation. For example, some chains have “&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;-slow” pools, and you get a third handle, to which you are supposed to send slow queries that cannot be optimised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other chains are shared between different applications, and in order to prevent crosstalk we have different pools, so that your &amp;ldquo;application-xml&amp;rdquo; queries do not mess with the regular “application-misc” queries. You are still using a “application-ro” handle, but it is non-overlapping between XML and normal application clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, we run automated capacity tests on each pool, and then adjust pool sizes as needed. We also report to ourselves on that. Sometimes that report is interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2020/10/mysql-pool-size-change.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The example-misc pool changed target size from 3 to 16 in the night of 05-Oct, which is a 433% increase.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minimum pool size is three, for redundancy reasons. The example chain is not busy, ever, and the pool size should &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; exceed three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DBA Operations talk to the customer: “I am reaching out to you because you are currently designated as owners of one or more of the database schemata in the example database chain. The schemata in question are &amp;lt;list&amp;gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting yesterday, the example chain (and, specifically, its example-misc pool) has seen a significant increase in load, mostly in the blue AZ, as shown here:”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2020/10/mysql-threads.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MySQL &amp;ldquo;Threads Running&amp;rdquo; going through the roof, load testing reports diminished capacity, and we ready more instances. The world is safe again! Or, is it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we detected an increased number of threads running, and that led to a general reduction in the capacity, and that requires &lt;em&gt;MOAR MACHINES!&lt;/em&gt; Yay! So our bots threw more machinery to ride the load wave and that kept us afloat for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that the story? It is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-mysterious-mystery&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#a-mysterious-mystery&#34;&gt;
	A mysterious mystery
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans descend on the problem and look. What are the machines in the pool, currently? Well, if you have the privileges, you can check with our roster tool:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; sudo roster-tool list /persistent/pools/example-misc/az-west1-a
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;0be2b240a6964a338f0a65f22a2bb09d-example-2016.dc1.prod.example.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;421e3f5c81914082b26f93cd096c4d25-example-8050.dc2.prod.example.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;95624c835c454bbb8ad10a2eb728f66a-example-8051.dc2.prod.example.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;afc7bd521a5c404582645d89598269d3-example-2015.dc1.prod.example.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;e5724da64f134c34810f48211f5b777c-example-2014.dc1.prod.example.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let’s have a look at example-8051:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2020/10/mysql-load.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This box is terribly idle. For 18 hours, it was slightly less idle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This box is terribly idle. It has 16 cores, 32 threads, it can do 32 things concurrently on a good day. Running MySQL, it usually becomes flaky at a &lt;em&gt;1m load average&lt;/em&gt; of 24, because we have web loads that are having very many short term variations, so “1m average of 24” really means “anything between 12 and 40”, if you look at things in 0.1s intervals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a target load of 24, and headroom for failover, the limit is 12 - but it will be flaky in degraded state then. We usually aim for a load of 8-10 on our boxes. For this database pool, we could do with one box instead of three in normal times, but three is the administrative lower limit for redundancy and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nothing-is-busy-but-we-dont-have-capacity&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#nothing-is-busy-but-we-dont-have-capacity&#34;&gt;
	Nothing is busy, but we don’t have capacity
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the incident it was higher, but not much. Yet, the capacity test returned a much diminished capacity and grew the chain by a factor of more than 4. Clearly, this is not load, but something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at a few metrics for the time between 04-Oct, noon and 05-Oct, 6am. We want to know if we can see more action than the CPU thing. Let’s check the network:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2020/10/mysql-network.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nope. No action on the network.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the disk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2020/10/mysql-disk.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We see few writes, and almost no reads. This is a memory-saturated database.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see very few disk writes (a few hundred writes per minute), and almost no disk reads. This is a database with the working set residing in memory, and queries are resolved without disk reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes a very low query latency, and also means that the database can really only bottleneck on Networking or CPU. Now, a MySQL is very hard to bottleneck on Networking - I have only ever seen this happen twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So whatever is happening and limiting us is a kind of CPU problem. Likely not a CPU saturation problem: We would see load &amp;gt; 20 for this, and we are very far from that. That means it is likely to be a per-thread CPU problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-could-cause-cpu-saturation&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-could-cause-cpu-saturation&#34;&gt;
	What could cause CPU saturation?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CPU saturation on a database can in my experience have very few and easily detectable causes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A frequent query running from memory with no index: full table scans from a memory resident table. No disk I/O, loads of memory reads. This is a badly designed table with a missing index, masked by good memory performance until the CPU is completely eaten up and the box goes down. Add the missing index to fix.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A frequent query doing a lot of sorting in memory. Data is not requested in index order, so it needs to be re-sorted before given to the client in order to satisfy an &lt;code&gt;ORDER BY&lt;/code&gt; clause. Can also be caused infrequently by weird &lt;code&gt;GROUP BY&lt;/code&gt; clauses. Fixed by sorting in the client, if possible, or by finding a better index so that data is returned in index order, which is designed to match the sort order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A system is offloading computation into the database using stored procedures. This is the worst possible design, and easily fixed by nuking the entire site from orbit, starting over from scratch at a new site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these cases would create a lot more load than we see, so it is none of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;query-workload&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#query-workload&#34;&gt;
	Query workload?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else stands out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2020/10/mysql-query-workload.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Queries/s stable, Select/s looking normal. A slow query &amp;ldquo;spike&amp;rdquo; of very few slow queries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The query load did not change, the capacity did. This is getting more mysterious by the second, but I think I know the smell. See that slow query “non-spike”? We have had slow queries, but it could not have been many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-we-know-by-now&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-we-know-by-now&#34;&gt;
	What we know by now
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some, very few, slow queries, queries,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an unsaturated database, not bottlenecking globally on any base resource&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a machine load going up by 2 from 1 to 3 (per thread problem, two queries?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long-running&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2019/11/18/a-blast-from-the-past.html&#34;&gt;seen this before&lt;/a&gt;

, and we have seen it &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2011/04/28/mysql-undo-log.html&#34;&gt;a long time before that&lt;/a&gt;

 as well. Let’s check the undo-log size:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2020/10/mysql-undo-log.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Undo-Log shark fin perfectly coinciding with the incident.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observe a shark fin in the Undo-Log size that perfectly matches the time span of the incident and the increased CPU time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;we-knew-this-is-bad&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#we-knew-this-is-bad&#34;&gt;
	We knew this is bad
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know from &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/07/27/mysql-transactions.html&#34;&gt;MySQL Transactions - the physical side&lt;/a&gt;

 what the Undo-Log is and what it is being used for: It’s keeping old versions of a row so that a transaction can have a stable read view preventing phantom reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned in &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/07/29/mysql-transactions-the-logical-view.html&#34;&gt;MySQL Transactions - the logical side&lt;/a&gt;

 how the Undo-Log is consulted, depending on the transaction isolation level setting of the reading connection. Go to that article now, and read the section on “Repeatable Read and Long Running Transactions”, now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The part where it says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a transaction at the default isolation level will force the Undo-Log Purge Thread to stop at the position of our read view. Undo-Log entries will no longer be purged, filling up and growing the Undo-Log. Reads and Index Lookups become more complicated and slower, slowing down the overall performance of the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it may be long-running transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;proof&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#proof&#34;&gt;
	Proof
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we prove that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is where metrics end, and observability starts. We would need a flight recorder that takes a snapshot of the database activities in regular intervals and keeps the data for some time so that we can look at non-numeric, non-aggregated detailed system stats from the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is such an obvious pressing need that &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.wl0.org/2011/02/log_processlist-sh-script-for-monitoring-mysql-instances/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Simon Mudd wrote a script&lt;/a&gt;

 to do that in the deep, dark past long before the term “observability” even existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It runs every minute, and collects system hardware stats, MySQL processlist and other data, and stashes them compressed in a ring buffer in &lt;code&gt;/var/log/mysql_pl/&amp;lt;weekday name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an age of bare-metal machines and all devs having production access you log into a database, cd into that directory and grab a random snapshot from the incident interval:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;/var/log/mysql_pl/Sun $ xzcat 23_48.innodb.xz &amp;gt; /tmp/kris
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;/var/log/mysql_pl/Sun $ vim /tmp/kris
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;/var/log/mysql_pl/Sun $ awk -F&amp;#39;\t&amp;#39; &amp;#39;($5 != &amp;#34;Sleep&amp;#34;) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !match($7, /Waiting for/)&amp;#39; /tmp/kris | less
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a text editor we isolate the processlist recording from 23:48 on 04-Oct. We then use Unix Tooling to look at all non-sleeping connections that are also not idle replication connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This yields indeed two interesting queries: Both show a &lt;code&gt;cronjob=reserve_projectname_upsert_transaction_ids&lt;/code&gt; running on &lt;code&gt;cronapp-39.dc2.prod.example.com&lt;/code&gt; and on &lt;code&gt;cronapp-02.dc2.prod.example.com&lt;/code&gt;, with runtimes of 16220 and 22170 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are indeed two long-running queries, coinciding perfectly with a load increase of 2, and they are easily identifiable cron queries. They run from two different hosts, with the same cron banner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what that job does, but we are looking at a &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; statement in &lt;code&gt;REPEATABLE READ&lt;/code&gt; isolation that has a run time of multiple hours, and unsurprisingly an Undo-Log escalation. That leads to slow query performance and reduced capacity for all things, including the capacity test, and a changed target size for the pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-we-can-learn-from-this&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-we-can-learn-from-this&#34;&gt;
	What we can learn from this
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the obvious, that is, fixing that cron?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, there is a moment in time in incident analysis where you need to pivot from identifying timeframes in which the incident happened and machines that are affected to actual instances of the incident in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also where you move from numeric aggregates in a dashboard to textual, structured logging information that actually has to be recorded before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what observability is about: The ability to do this pivot easily, within one system, without special privileges, with proper tooling, in distributed systems, at will, without access to the actual box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t have observability. We need to get better at this. Go, follow &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Charity Majors on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With such tooling, we need to connect what we teach with actual incidents that show how the teachings connect to real world cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why I am typing up this thing, right now and link to the actual write-ups that enabled me to show you this. Go, read these things again, please, in the light of this particular episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know in your head what &amp;ldquo;Undo-Log&amp;rdquo; means. Here you can understand what &amp;ldquo;Undo-Log&amp;rdquo; feels like. Go, &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/08/31/on-touching-candles.html&#34;&gt;touch the candle&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have all the tooling, but it is from a different age.
An age where people either routinely had access to production or sat next to a DBA in an office and could easily get at all the metrics.
Observability by shell script on a root shell is a thing we have in abundance, because that was enough in that time and age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do no longer have access to root shells in production, and in the age of anything as a service not even to shells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observability as taught by Charity Majors is your trusted &lt;code&gt;printf(“Checkpoint: I am here.\n”);&lt;/code&gt; or your &lt;a href=&#34;https://sourceforge.net/projects/dbug/files/dbug/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Fred Fish Dbug Macros&lt;/a&gt;

 brought into the 21st century &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.honeycomb.io/getting-data-in/python/beeline/#using-a-decorator&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;age of distributed services&lt;/a&gt;

, and the tooling to create metrics from events, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.honeycomb.io/getting-data-in/python/beeline/#queries-to-try&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;then slice and dice that in any dimension&lt;/a&gt;

 without having a privileged shell on the broken system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, let’s upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while there is the IT news article that kind of triggers me. This time it was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.golem.de/news/object-storage-object-storage-protokoll-koennte-posix-abloesen-2010-151294.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Object-Storage-Protokoll könnte Posix ablösen&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;

 in german computer news site &lt;a href=&#34;https://golem.de&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Golem&lt;/a&gt;

. The article speaks about mmap(), NVMEoF and object storage and how it could revolutionize or complete object storages, but does not link to an original article, names no persons and no paper. Also, what do these things - mmap, NVMEoF, object storage and Posix, even have in common? It is not explained anywhere in the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another article &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2018/11/29/but-is-it-atomic.html&#34;&gt;But is it atomic?&lt;/a&gt;

 we dive into the internals of the old UNIX V7 kernel, and how design decisions and technical realities from the late 1970ies became immortialized as technical requirements for filesystems in the Posix standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Unix is historically grown, and a lot of things have changed since that time. The original file system (for Linux users: &amp;ldquo;mkfs -t minix&amp;rdquo; is the closest thing to that which you might have) is not even used any more anywhere in a modern system. But it is basically what Posix means when we speak about &amp;ldquo;Posix File System Semantics&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic design is good - I mean, it has held up almost 50 years by now, and that is a fantastic achievement. It even has value in modern systems. But it has been designed for local systems, and it is not scalable to distributed systems very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So everybody is either cheating or slow. There is &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GFS2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GFS2&lt;/a&gt;

 as an example for slow. There is NFS as an example for hidden cheating (I am looking at you, &lt;code&gt;actimeo&lt;/code&gt;, and at you, &lt;code&gt;lockd&lt;/code&gt;). And there is &amp;ldquo;Object Storage&amp;rdquo;, whatever that specifically means, as an example for doing things completely differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mutability-as-the-root-of-all-evil&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#mutability-as-the-root-of-all-evil&#34;&gt;
	Mutability as The Root of All Evil
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest baggage Posix has, in terms of distributed systems, is mutable files. You can open a file, fseek() to an offset of 1MB and overwrite a 3MB segment in a 10MB file. I am choosing these sizes and offsets to make it abundantly clear that writes can be large, larger than a network packet, a disk block or other allocation units, and that they can take measureable, non-zero time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;one-writer-per-inode-per-time&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#one-writer-per-inode-per-time&#34;&gt;
	One writer per Inode, per time
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Posix demands that writes are atomic (see link above), and it implemented that originally by locking the (only copy) of the file with a central lock at the in-memory inode of the file. This has multiple effects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There can be only one write active at a time for a file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This already is a problem for local filesystems, when you have a database that wants to write out many concurrent changes to different non-overlapping records in a database file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Databases work around the problem either by defining tablespaces from many small sized &amp;ldquo;.DBF&amp;rdquo; files (Oracle) - 1GB to 4 GB seem to be popular. Or they work around it by  foregoing the use of filesystems entirely - using raw disks, at a terrible toil cost for sysadmins and DBAs. Only XFS in O_DIRECT mode will handle this better, by not blocking concurrent writes as long as they are non-overlapping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reads never happen concurrently with writes, too. They are either completely before or after the write instead. If they happen after the write, they will never return stale data, but always the most recently written fresh data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In distributed systems, this is very expensive: Imagine a storage cluster with dozens or hundreds of storage nodes and hundreds or thousands of clients. Parts of the file we are about to write to may have been cached anywhere in any cluster node or client to avoid excessive network transfers. These cached copies are now all invalid, because they contain data that has been overwritten with potentially different values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because reads must not return stale data under Posix, we need to invalidate all of these copies, and - worse - we need to this under a lock to ensure atomicity and fresh reads. So each write (write, not commit/fsync, which can happen much less often) has to inform all relevant nodes with a copy of the data that there is a new write for an extent (offset, length) incoming and wait for the acknowledgement. And then let the write proceed, to wait again to collect the complete acknowledgement of all data nodes that they have the data, and all caches that the have destroyed or updated their cached copy. That&amp;rsquo;s a lot of waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is unimaginably slow, and even worse, should the cluster topology change during  any operation - a node taking part in our operation leaving the cluster or similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you happen to have two concurrent overlapping writes (write A to node 1 at offset 0, length 3MB, and write B to node 12 at offset 1MB, length 3MB), Posix also demands ordering between these writes - A either happens in total before or after B. You will never end up with an ABABABAB block pattern in the overlap, and again, this can only be guaranteed by locking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing &amp;ldquo;made&amp;rdquo; Posix specify this, this is just the natural behavior in a single core 1970ies computer when you lock interrupts (&lt;code&gt;spl()&lt;/code&gt;) or &lt;code&gt;plock()&lt;/code&gt; on an in-memory inode, which then was later officially documented and bless into a standard when the Posix specificationw as written. Our modern computers do not have these properties any more, so we need to make them wait to simulate this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case: The combination of Mutability and Strong Read Consistency/Atomic Write Behavior creates a cluster wide locking problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-metadata-and-synchronous-metadata-updates&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#fixed-metadata-and-synchronous-metadata-updates&#34;&gt;
	Fixed metadata, and synchronous metadata updates
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things get even worse when we look at metadata. The set of metadata in a Unix Inode is fixed, and documented in Posix, too. We have the typical Unix access rights (ugo times rwx) and the three second-resolution times (a/m/ctime), and a file length - that is basically it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an attempt to extend this, using Posix File ACLs (ACL) and Posix Extended Attributes (xattr), but for example mapping NTFS access permissions to Posix ACLs is complicated - just look at what Samba has to do to get this approximately right. The fact that the Unix notion of a user identity is scoped to a local machine does not help at all - your userid 0 is different from my user id 0 in meaning, and if I am UID 0 on my box I probably should not be UID 0 on yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Posix demands synchronus updates to metadata updates. When you extend a file, this should be visible immediately in the file length, and when you access a file, the atime should update, too. Even on local filesystems this is no longer doable - everybody mounts their Linux disks with a variant of &lt;code&gt;noatime&lt;/code&gt; or the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while data writes distribute themselves across the cluster, metadata updates do not. They all have to hit the relatively small number of metadata nodes, and this load often crushed metadata servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-key-idea-immutability&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-key-idea-immutability&#34;&gt;
	The key idea: Immutability
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that all the things we spoke about are lower file system problems - they happen at the level of individual files already, not even going into upper file system, directory hierarchies and path names. That&amp;rsquo;s not even necessary, because as long as the lower file system is not in shape looking up is kind of pointless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Object Stores have one single core idea: Files are immutable, maybe appendable (S3 is not, Google GFS and Hadoop HDFS are). The payoff is that we can cache this stuff, because the cache never becomes invalid. Maybe the end of the file is not up to date, but it will be eventually consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file has a Key-Value store with metadata, which can even grow to considerable size, and which is also eventually consistent. With the upper file system we do the same: The entire namespace is one single KV store, in which the key is a binary string that cosplays a path name, and the value is the actual file data (and metadata).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has far reaching consequences: We can talk about &amp;ldquo;Log Structured Merge Trees&amp;rdquo;, why they became popular in database land, and how that plays nicely with Object Storages. Or we can talk about how &amp;ldquo;Event Sourcing&amp;rdquo; favors &amp;ldquo;append only data structures&amp;rdquo;, and how that plays nicely with Object Storages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;there-is-a-timeline-and-there-is-progress&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#there-is-a-timeline-and-there-is-progress&#34;&gt;
	There is a timeline, and there is progress
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original Unix File System is, for the sake of illustration, basically the state of the art as seen in 1974.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of elementary improvements to this initial idea that we find reflected in BSD FFS, from 1984.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The culmination point of these ideas, and structures, can be found in Silicon Graphics XFS, from 1994.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A completely different way of thinking can be found in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_file_system&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Log Structured File Systems&lt;/a&gt;

, first seen in Ousterhout&amp;rsquo;s  Sprite, in the early 1990. But performancewise the original implementation that was a failure: the first successful and performant implementation can be found  - made by Oursterhout&amp;rsquo;s students - in Solaris ZFS, and at the same time in NetApps WAFL, which promptly engaged in a legal battle over patents. In parallel, many ZFS ideas are being reimplemented about half a decade later in Btrfs. All of that would put us roughly into 2004, in terms of commercial availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, widespread adoption of Object Storages in persistence products, using Log Structured Merge (LSM) Trees, has taken place. We find them in Elastic Search, in Cassandra, in RocksDB and its many applications, and many more. In a timeline, this would put us into 2014-land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LFS-like non-overwriting structures are also at the foundation of all of our storage, deep down in the block-simulation layer of flash storage devices, again around 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-developments&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#other-developments&#34;&gt;
	Other developments
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flash Storage originally appeared as a simulated hard disk, SSD. So we have a PCI bus, on which there is a SATA controller, which connects to the simulated hard disks&amp;rsquo; flash controller, which talks to the flash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ssd-nvme-roce-and-nvmeof&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#ssd-nvme-roce-and-nvmeof&#34;&gt;
	SSD, NVME, RoCE, and NVMEoF
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVME is what we get when we ask the question &amp;ldquo;What purpose does the SATA controller have in this setup, anyway?&amp;rdquo; - except slowing everything down, forcing us to use antiquated SCSI commands and serializing access to the highly parallel flash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVME therefore is a PCI bus, which talks to flash controllers, which talk to the flash, and a revised command set for this. The great innovation is to put away the single disk queue and allow many of these. Which allows us to utilize around 800k IOPS per device, even if a single operation can take as long as 1/20.000th of a second - just go 40-way wide, if you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what if we had a way to speak to a NVME device on a different computers PCI bus as if it were local? That&amp;rsquo;s what remote DMA (RDMA) would enable us to do. RoCE (&amp;ldquo;rocky&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;RDMA over Converged Ethernet&amp;rdquo;) initially was painful - RoCE V1 was unrouteable raw Ethernet with its own Ethertype. RoCE V2 fixed that, and put the entire stuff into UDP instead, so it was routeable, at least within a single data center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, the value in RDMA is more in the Remote than in the DMA, so when RoCE became &amp;ldquo;NVME over Fabric over TCP&amp;rdquo; (NVMEoF/TCP), it was valuable and useful to have, even if you had an ultracheap Broadcom that did not properly DMA the way RoCE needs it. The resulting access to a remote NVME still was as fast as to a local SSD, or even faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mmap&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#mmap&#34;&gt;
	mmap()
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, &lt;code&gt;mmap()&lt;/code&gt; is a Unix system call that allows you to map a file into the address space of a process: when you access a memory page, this memory page is appropriately filled with the content of the file, automatically. Think &amp;ldquo;swap from any file into memory, not just from a swap file&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For mutable files, and the kings of mutability, relational databases, mmap() is of little use and has many complexities. Databases need extending files, controlled write-out to persistent storage, not overwriting data because MVCC. Also, different data formats on disk and in memory are actually important to people who transact, and hence mmap() does help very little for most databases. We can talk about &amp;ldquo;Optane&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;PMEM&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;transactional memory&amp;rdquo;, but that&amp;rsquo;s a different lecture for another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making an &lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt; file available &lt;em&gt;read-only&lt;/em&gt; in memory has none of these complexities, and is actually very useful and efficient. This is what mmap() is really, really good at - you get clean, discardable memory pages, none of the file extension problems, none of the &amp;ldquo;which pages are written to disk at what point in time&amp;rdquo; sychronisation problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is so good that Bryan Cantrill actually had it first, and foreshadowed &amp;ldquo;Serverless&amp;rdquo; in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/joyent/manta&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Manta&lt;/a&gt;

. Basically, Joyent starts a &amp;ldquo;Container&amp;rdquo;, actually a BSD &amp;ldquo;jail&amp;rdquo; or Solaris &amp;ldquo;zone&amp;rdquo;, because containers weren&amp;rsquo;t fully invented, yet. It then maps a kind of not-quite-S3 object into it and your code can  access this, and emit output results into a new object in the same or a different bucket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mmap() in this is a nice sugar on top of it, as it makes reads automatic,  en-passant and makes I/O minimal. The important fact is that Input and Output are distinguished and the input file is still immutable. Because it is, the munmap() is unimportant - exit() is also a munmap() and since the object is immutable it is unimportant if it stays mapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;putting-it-all-together&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#putting-it-all-together&#34;&gt;
	Putting it all together
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you have a page fault and have to get a page from local storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why not get it from Ethernet, via RDMA, remotely, from any disk anywhere in your data center? Can we have this as a kernel extension and - more important - standardized in the NVME spec?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, now we&amp;rsquo;re talking. &amp;ldquo;We have standardized remote page fault reads over NVMEoF&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the article - at least, that is what I think it is, because it does not say so, and it references nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even so, it needs 50 years of Unix as a context to be understandable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still don&amp;rsquo;t know what the original article was, but there is stuff such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/yang&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;FileMR: Rethinking RDMA Networking for Scalable Persistent Memory&lt;/a&gt;

 that is being worked on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/isotopp/status/1313084116569645057&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;a twitter tread&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>MySQL: Import CSV, not using LOAD DATA</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/09/28/mysql-import-csv-not-using-load-data.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Sep 2020 18:00:34 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/09/28/mysql-import-csv-not-using-load-data.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;All over the Internet people are having trouble getting &lt;code&gt;LOAD DATA&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;LOAD DATA LOCAL&lt;/code&gt; to work. Frankly, do not use them, and especially not the &lt;code&gt;LOCAL&lt;/code&gt; variant. They are insecure, and even if you get them to work, they are limited and unlikely to do what you want. Write a small data load program as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;not-using-load-data-local&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#not-using-load-data-local&#34;&gt;
	Not using LOAD DATA LOCAL
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/load-data-local-security.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The fine manual says&lt;/a&gt;

:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LOCAL version of LOAD DATA has two potential security issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because LOAD DATA LOCAL is an SQL statement, parsing occurs on the server side, and transfer of the file from the client host to the server host is initiated by the MySQL server, which tells the client the file named in the statement. In theory, a patched server could tell the client program to transfer a file of the server&amp;rsquo;s choosing rather than the file named in the statement. Such a server could access any file on the client host to which the client user has read access. (A patched server could in fact reply with a file-transfer request to any statement, not just LOAD DATA LOCAL, so a more fundamental issue is that clients should not connect to untrusted servers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Web environment where the clients are connecting from a Web server, a user could use LOAD DATA LOCAL to read any files that the Web server process has read access to (assuming that a user could run any statement against the SQL server). In this environment, the client with respect to the MySQL server actually is the Web server, not a remote program being run by users who connect to the Web server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second issue in reality means that if the web server has a suitable SQL injection vulnerability, the attacker may use that to read any file the web server has access to, bouncing this through the database server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, never use (or even enable) &lt;code&gt;LOAD DATA LOCAL&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;local_infile&lt;/code&gt; is disabled in the server config, and you should keep it that way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;client libraries are by default compiled with &lt;code&gt;ENABLED_LOCAL_INFILE&lt;/code&gt; set to off. It can still be enabled using a call to the &lt;code&gt;mysql_options()&lt;/code&gt; C-API, but never do that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8.0.21+ places additional restrictions on this, to prevent you from being stupid (that is, actually enabling this anywhere).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;not-using-load-data&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#not-using-load-data&#34;&gt;
	Not using LOAD DATA
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;LOAD DATA&lt;/code&gt; variant of the command assumes that you place a file on the database server, into a directory in the file system of the server, and load it from there. In the age of &amp;ldquo;MySQL as a service&amp;rdquo; this is inconvenient to impossible, so forget about this option, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were able to do place files onto the system where your mysqld lives,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your user needs to have &lt;code&gt;FILE&lt;/code&gt; as a privilege, a global privilege (&lt;code&gt;GRANT FILE TO ... ON *.*&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the server variable &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_secure_file_priv&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;secure_file_priv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

 needs to be set to a directory name, and that directory needs to be world-readable. &lt;code&gt;LOAD DATA&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SELECT INTO OUTFILE&lt;/code&gt; work only with filenames below this directory. Setting this variable requires a server restart, this is not a dynamic variable (on purpose).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the variable can be &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; (this is secure in the sense that &lt;code&gt;LOAD DATA&lt;/code&gt; is disabled) or empty (this is insecure in that there are no restrictions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing preventing you from setting the variable to &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/mysql&lt;/code&gt; or other dumb locations which would expose vital system files to load and save operations. Do not do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, a location such as &lt;code&gt;/tmp&lt;/code&gt; or any other world-writeable directory would be dumb: Use a dedicated directory that is writeable by the import user only, and make sure that it is world-readable in order to make the command work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better:&lt;/strong&gt; Do not use this command at all (and set &lt;code&gt;secure_file_priv&lt;/code&gt; to NULL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-data-dump-and-load-programs-instead&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#using-data-dump-and-load-programs-instead&#34;&gt;
	Using data dump and load programs instead
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spoke about dumping a schema into CSV files in &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/06/20/export-the-entire-database-to-csv.html&#34;&gt;Export the entire database to CSV&lt;/a&gt;

 already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To complete the discussion we need to provide a way to do the inverse and load data from a CSV file into a table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full code is in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/isotopp/mysql-dev-examples/blob/master/mysql-csv/load.py&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;load.py&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main idea is to open a &lt;code&gt;.csv&lt;/code&gt; file with &lt;code&gt;csv.reader&lt;/code&gt;, and then iterate over the rows. For each row, we execute an &lt;code&gt;INSERT&lt;/code&gt; statement, and every few rows we also &lt;code&gt;COMMIT&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of dependencies, we rely on &lt;code&gt;MySQLdb&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;csv&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;MySQLdb&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;csv&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to know the name of a table, and the column names of that table (in the order in which they appear).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should also make sure we can change the delimiter and quoting character used by the CSV, and make the commit interval variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we need to be able to connect to the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# table to load into&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;data&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# column names to load into&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;id&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;d&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;e&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# formatting options&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;delimiter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;quotechar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#34;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# commit every commit_interval lines&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;commit_interval&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# connect to database, set mysql_use_results mode for streaming&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;db_config&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;localhost&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;kris&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;passwd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;geheim&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;kris&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;From this, we can build a database connection and an &lt;code&gt;INSERT&lt;/code&gt; statement, using the table name and column names:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;MySQLdb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;db_config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# build a proper insert command&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cmd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;sa&#34;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;insert into &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt; ( &amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cmd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cmd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;) values (&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cmd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;,&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cmd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cmd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;)&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sa&#34;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;cmd = &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cmd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actual code is then rather simple: Open the CSV file, named after the table, and create a &lt;code&gt;csv.reader()&lt;/code&gt;. Using this, we iterate over the rows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each row, we execute the insert statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every &lt;code&gt;commit_interval&lt;/code&gt; rows we commit, and for good measure we also commit after finishing, to make sure any remaining rows also get written out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sa&#34;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;.csv&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;r&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;csvfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that it. That&amp;rsquo;s all the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No &lt;code&gt;FILE&lt;/code&gt; privilege,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No special permissions besides &lt;code&gt;insert_priv&lt;/code&gt; into the target table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No config in the database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No server restart to set up the permissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And using Python&amp;rsquo;s multiprocessing, you could make it load multiple tables in parallel or chunk a very large table and load that in parallel - assuming you have database hardware that could profit from any of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case - this is simpler, more secure and less privileged than any of the broken &lt;code&gt;LOAD DATA&lt;/code&gt; variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t use them, write a loader program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s run it. First we generate some data, using the previous example from the partitions tutorial:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;(venv) kris@server:~/Python/mysql$ mysql-partitions/partitions.py setup-tables
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;(venv) kris@server:~/Python/mysql$ mysql-partitions/partitions.py start-processing
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;create p2 reason: not enough partitions
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;cmd = alter table data add partition ( partition p2 values less than ( 20000))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;create p3 reason: not enough partitions
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;cmd = alter table data add partition ( partition p3 values less than ( 30000))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;create p4 reason: not enough partitions
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;cmd = alter table data add partition ( partition p4 values less than ( 40000))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;create p5 reason: not enough partitions
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;cmd = alter table data add partition ( partition p5 values less than ( 50000))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;create p6 reason: not enough empty partitions
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;cmd = alter table data add partition ( partition p6 values less than ( 60000))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;counter = 1000
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;counter = 2000
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;counter = 3000
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;counter = 4000
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;^CError in atexit._run_exitfuncs:

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then dump the data, truncate the table, and reload the data. We count the rows to be sure we get all of them back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;(venv) kris@server:~/Python/mysql$ mysql-csv/dump.py

      <title>Importing account statements and building a data warehouse</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/09/26/my-private-data-warehouse.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Sep 2020 09:50:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/09/26/my-private-data-warehouse.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is an update and translation of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2006/07/23/mein-privates-datawarehouse-sparen-mit-mysql.html&#34;&gt;much older article&lt;/a&gt;

, which I wrote in German Language back then. I was experimenting with importing the account statements from my German Sparkasse, which at that time were being made available as a CSV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-initial-data-load&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-initial-data-load&#34;&gt;
	The initial data load
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; head -2 /home/kris/Documents/banking/umsatz-22758031-29122004.csv
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Local Account&amp;#34;;&amp;#34;Book Date&amp;#34;;&amp;#34;Valuta Date&amp;#34;;&amp;#34;Transaction Type&amp;#34;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Purpose&amp;#34;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Remote Party&amp;#34;;&amp;#34;Remote Account&amp;#34;;&amp;#34;Bank Code&amp;#34;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Amount&amp;#34;;&amp;#34;Currency&amp;#34;;&amp;#34;Info&amp;#34;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;08154711&amp;#34;;&amp;#34;30.12&amp;#34;;&amp;#34;30.12.05&amp;#34;;&amp;#34;Direct Debit&amp;#34;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;DRP 08154711 040441777  INKL. 16% UST 5.38 EUR&amp;#34;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;STRATO MEDIEN AG&amp;#34;;&amp;#34;040441777&amp;#34;;&amp;#34;10050000&amp;#34;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;-39,00&amp;#34;;&amp;#34;EUR&amp;#34;;&amp;#34;Direct Debit booked&amp;#34;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because I want to know how I spend my money, I am loading the data into MySQL. Here is how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a first step we are defining a table into which to load the data. The table has columns whose primary purpose it to hold the data. We still have to clean and adjust the data to be able to do things with the data, so we are not looking at the final fields or types at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;-- load data
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;warnings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;DROP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;IF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;EXISTS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;transactions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;CREATE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;transactions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;localaccount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;bookdate_text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadly, we have no unique transaction identifiers, so I cannot really define a proper primary key. I am trying to make do with a &lt;code&gt;UNIQUE INDEX&lt;/code&gt;, but it is likely overly specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The failure scenario is that I have to specify start and end dates when exporting the account statements, and sometimes a few records are exported twice: At the end of the one statement file, and at the beginning of the next statement file again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent loading the same line twice if it happens to appear in multiple CSV files this unique index is probably okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I load can load the various CSV files into this table:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;unsigned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;auto_increment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;cleaning-and-changing-the-data&#34;&gt;

	Cleaning and changing the data
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can now copy the data over, and in the process clean it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;amount&lt;/code&gt; field has to be changed from &amp;ldquo;xxx.xxx,yy&amp;rdquo; (german monetary notation with dots between the thousands, and a comma before the cents) to &amp;ldquo;xxxxxxx.yy&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also have to turn the date fields &lt;code&gt;valutadate_text&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;bookdate_text&lt;/code&gt; into iso date syntax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to add a year to bookdate_text, taking it from the valutadate_text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;info&lt;/code&gt; column is useless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now want to aggregate my expenses. In the raw data, spent money is listed together with the remote account it went to. To aggregate, we need to assign each of these accounts to a category, for example we would assign all gas stations to the &amp;ldquo;fuel&amp;rdquo; category or all supermarkets to the &amp;ldquo;food&amp;rdquo; category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can have a table &amp;ldquo;moneysinks&amp;rdquo; that does this account to category assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;-- add category
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;alter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;varchar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;category&lt;/code&gt; I can also group this and make group totals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;order&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;total&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will tell me how I spend my money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often I want to observe how my spending habits change over time, so I would not just use the categories from the moneysinks table as grouping criterion, but also group over some time dimension (&lt;code&gt;GROUP BY year(bookdate) as year, category&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my data warehouse grows, it may be useful to run the aggregation query and save the result in some pre-aggregated table (by day or month), as a kind of materialized view of the aggregates. I can use these to create coarser grained aggregates faster (take daily sums and counts, and create monthly or yearly aggregates, fast).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary-and-outlook&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#summary-and-outlook&#34;&gt;
	Summary and outlook
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using account statements from a bank, we have built a basic data warehouse. We demonstrated data import, staging and cleaning processes. Using category tables, we demonstrated how bin individual records into larger sets that can be useful in statistical analysis, and we looked at how we could materialize these aggregations into pre-aggregated tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a toy data warehouse, and it poses no challenges in data management due to the small size. Still, it has many properties that are also present in larger structures. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at this in a more generalized way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A data warehouse is centered around one or more fact tables. Fact tables always have a time dimension, they have log-like nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;literal-attribute-values-resolve-ids&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#literal-attribute-values-resolve-ids&#34;&gt;
	Literal attribute values, resolve id&amp;rsquo;s
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fact tables contain snapshot data that is not normalized, but contains literal values. In our example: actual account holder names, and account numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example in a sales warehouse from a web shop, we are never interested in the current price of an item in a sales-fact table, but always in what we sold it for back then, for each individual sale. We are never interested where the customer lives now, but where we sent the article.
Hence, we log literal attributes, never ids pointing to the current article or customer record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;encoding-can-shrink-tables-but-do-only-what-is-necessary&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#encoding-can-shrink-tables-but-do-only-what-is-necessary&#34;&gt;
	Encoding can shrink tables, but do only what is necessary
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This often leads to data duplication. In our example, the string &amp;ldquo;SCHECK IN CENTER KA DURLACH&amp;rdquo; is repeated 36 times. For the amount of data shown in our example this does not matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in the one million rows example in &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/09/18/mysql-encoding-fields-for-great-profit.html&#34;&gt;Coding fields for great profit&lt;/a&gt;

 the gain is not critical, though substantial. A data warehouse starting out can often skip encoding the values and just take the hit from the duplication. An encoding step can be performed later, as long as there is infrastructure in place for online schema change, and sufficient disk space.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-star-and-the-snowflake&#34;&gt;
	The Star and the Snowflake
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we talk about OLTP databases, we often talk about normalization, and aiming for the 3rd normal form as an idealized schema to work from. For transactional data that is a good model and a good goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In data warehousing, this is obviously not the case - our data has a time dimension, and unlike OLTP, in a data warehouse we are interested in how things were then, not what they are like now. In our example, we are interested in how much we spent for the fuel back then, and not what the same amount would cost us now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, in a data warehouse the logged data usually does not change much after the fact: there can be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;back filling, due to data arriving late,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;backpropagation of newly added attributes,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or there can be corrections due to transactions changed after the fact at the business level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these require us to be able to rewrite our logs for some time window. But eventually that window closes and the data becomes immutable, and we can seal it (run &lt;code&gt;OPTIMIZE TABLE&lt;/code&gt;, and apply encoding and page level compression).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our example, once money is spent, it would not come back (or if, in a second corrective reverse booking), and the amounts booked would never change. The log records are immutable from the outset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things that OLTP structures need to avoid by normalizing - insert, update and delete paradox - do not happen to us in the same way. Also, because our data does not change much (if ever), but grows a lot over time, it is useful to invest the CPU cycles for data compression (using encoding at the data model level, and using page compression at the database engine level, in this order) once the data can be sealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classical structure of a data warehouse is therefore the star, in which we have a fact table, and a number of category tables aiding binning, plus a number of generated daily/weekly/monthly pre-aggregates as outputs. All of these auxiliary tables group around the fact table, linked to it in some way, hence the &amp;ldquo;Star Schema&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our example, we have the &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; fact table, and only a single binning input table, &lt;code&gt;moneysinks&lt;/code&gt;. More complicated warehouses can have many more of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have no materialized output tables (&lt;code&gt;expenses per days&lt;/code&gt; or similar), because our data set is small enough to do all of this ad-hoc. In larger warehouses, materializing aggregates that help to speed up reports is useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you add categories of categories, or produce multidimensional aggregates, you go from Star to Snowflake Schema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Star and the Snowflake are the normal forms for Data Warehouses, Normalization as practiced in transactional databases is not helpful, 3NF is not a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#time-dimensional-tables-in-oltp-schemas&#34;&gt;
	Time Dimensional Tables in OLTP schemas
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost every OLTP schema earning money has some tables in it that have a time dimension. It is often visible either in the table name (&lt;code&gt;shop.sales_202009&lt;/code&gt;) or in the tables primary key - often a compound primary key which contains a pair of an id and a date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be visible in any case, if you think about each tables&amp;rsquo; growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume unchanging conditions - a webshop with a mostly fixed number of articles, and a mostly fixed number of customers buying at a fixed rate, which tables will stay at a fixed size, and which tables will grow without bounds?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution: It is the &lt;code&gt;orders&lt;/code&gt; table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find these unbounded structures in your schema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of every OLTP schema there is a data warehouse that is struggling to get out. You get it out by completing the data lifecycle for the OLTP phase of things and establishing an &lt;em&gt;Extract, Transform and Load cycle (ETL cycle)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In planning a data warehouse, you identify tables without growth boundaries, and decide which data attributes you want to record as literal data for the warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Extract phase you create a monster join you resolve all id values present in your normalized data, extract the literal attributes of interest, and push them into a CSV or some staging table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data in the OLTP system can now be deleted by the OLTP systems data lifecycle management without concern for other, non-transactional business functions: we have isolated the non-transactional concerns and confined them to the Extraction process (which will have to be adjusted when the OLTP schema changes, so we are a stakeholder in the OLTP schema evolution).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isolation of concerns means that the OLTP system of our shop can now delete or archive orders at will after fulfillment or whatever other concerns the transactional system has to serve. Our non-transactional needs are all served from the data gathered in the Extract phase of the ETL process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The staged extracted values can now be cleaned, categorized and aggregated, depending on the demands from the non-transactional business concerns (statistics, business intelligence, decision-making and so on).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying data warehousey tables in OLTP systems, and isolating the transactional and non-transactional business concerns is important to keep the OLTP system small and agile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without taking the non-transactional, long term business functions out the OLTP system will grow without bounds, and ultimately transactional performance will suffer - the system will choke on itself. The non-transactional concerns not being isolated and bundled will also impede OLTP schema evolution and choke the development process on the money-earning side.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#data-lifecycle-management-at-the-warehouse&#34;&gt;
	Data Lifecycle Management at the Warehouse
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fact tables in the data warehouse have a time dimension, and as time passes, they will accumulate more data. In order to manage our data warehouse, we will also have to complete the data lifecycle on this side of the ETL boundary, and establish some deletion policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Queries to the data warehouse table are often time bounded (&amp;ldquo;How did sales change in the last 2 years&amp;rdquo;) and binned by - among other things - a time dimension (&amp;ldquo;How did demand change month-over-month&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Which of our products are seasonal?&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handling data at volume, and getting rid of data no longer needed, is much easier in MySQL &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/09/24/mysql-deleting-data.html&#34;&gt;when using partitions&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In data warehouses, partitions are usually on a time value as the first dimension. That is, we partition our data set by year, month or day, and we delete data by dropping old partitions. This leaves all internal B-Trees in all the partitions sub-tables untouched and as they have been after the import, optimization and compression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As queries also have a time dimension, the optimizer profits from this structure as well. It can exclude entire partitions from consideration, making the subset of data to look at much smaller.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#daily-snapshots-are-slow-but-simple&#34;&gt;
	Daily Snapshots are slow, but simple
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A daily snapshot ETL import is slow - you do not get realtime data updates - but simple to implement retroactively on existing structures. Realtime structures require more engineering, but can be crafted on top of existing architectures as well. We are going to look at them in some later examples.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MySQL: automatic partitions surely would be nice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/09/24/mysql-deleting-data.html&#34;&gt;Deleting data&lt;/a&gt;

 we have been looking at a process that loads data into MySQL, leveraging partitions to make it easier and faster to later get rid of the data again. For this, we created three processes, a data loader process, and two observers - one for creating partitions, and one for deleting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The observer processes have been running &lt;code&gt;ANALYZE TABLES&lt;/code&gt; and then polling &lt;code&gt;INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS&lt;/code&gt; every 1/10th of a second to check if intervention is needed. They then have been dynamically generating the necessary &lt;code&gt;ALTER TABLE&lt;/code&gt; statements maintaining the proper partitioning of the table by adding and dropping additional partitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is cumbersome and should not be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-sql-to-maintain-partitions&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#using-sql-to-maintain-partitions&#34;&gt;
	Using SQL to maintain partitions
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to prepare and execute dynamic DDL in MySQL, using &lt;code&gt;PREPARE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;EXECUTE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DEALLOCATE PREPARE&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I can do the following, if I numb myself sufficiently to actually write and generate code in procedural SQL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;kris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;localhost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;kris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;next_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;p3&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could put the logic of the partitioner and dropper into stored procedures and use the MySQL Event Scheduler to have this running in the background at all times to maintain the partitions on the &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except that would still fail if I insert too many rows in a single transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may be able to run the calls to my stored procedures in an insert trigger, but that is overhead I&amp;rsquo;d rather not have for each row inserted. Also, I am pretty confident that the trigger will also trigger a number of bugs in rarely used code paths. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

	Wishful thinking
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An actual solution would be a less cumbersome notation for partitions, specifically range partitioning by an auto_increment primary key, and range partitioning along a time dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should be able to write how many partitions of which bucket size I want instead of maintaining a giant if-then-else of &lt;code&gt;VALUES LESS THAN&lt;/code&gt; statements. SQL is supposed to be a declarative language, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the time dimension, I should be able to specify the same, in retention time and intervals for the buckets. MySQL would then create and drop partitions automatically, and generate the names for them automatically, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So something like the following made-up syntax:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;-- maintain 10 buckets,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;-- equivalent to

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;--

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would get rid of any manually maintained procedures, events, triggers, and most importantly, implementations, and specify procedurally how and when partitions are created and how long they are kept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not quite as automatic as Cassandra TTL fields, but a large step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MySQL: Deleting data</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Completing the data lifecycle is often harder than originally expected:
Deleting data can sometimes cost way more than inserting it in the first place.
MySQL Partitions can offer a way out.
We have an &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/05/13/deleting-data-from-mysql.html&#34;&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt;

 on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-sample-table-and-a-problem-statement&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#a-sample-table-and-a-problem-statement&#34;&gt;
	A sample table, and a problem statement
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s define a kind of log table, to which data is added with an &lt;code&gt;auto_increment&lt;/code&gt; id value and some data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ch&#34;&gt;#! /usr/bin/env python3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;randint&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;multiprocessing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Process&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;MySQLdb&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;MySQLdb.cursors&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sa&#34;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;setup_tables: failed &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt; with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cmd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;.&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is our basic Python framework for experimentation, using the &lt;code&gt;click&lt;/code&gt; framework, and a command &lt;code&gt;setup-tables&lt;/code&gt;. This command will run a number of SQL statements to initialize our log table named &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The log table has three columns: &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;, an auto_increment counter, and two columns &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;, each containing 64 characters of data. To get things started, we add an initial partition, containing all id-values below 10.000 and an initial row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were to add data to this table in a loop, we would increment our id-counter, and with InnoDB being what it is, all new rows will be added at the end of the table: We remember from &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/09/22/alter-table-for-uuid.html&#34;&gt;ALTER TABLE for UUID&lt;/a&gt;

 that the physical order of any InnoDB table is by primary key - our id-counter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if we were to expire old data, we would start to delete rows with the lowest id-values, so we would delete rows from the beginning of the table, or the left-hand side of the B+-Tree. To keep the tree balanced, MySQL would have to execute balancing operations, which will be expensive, because rows are being shuffled around in the tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/loeschen_einfuegen.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New data is added to the right-hand side of the B+-Tree, while old data is being deleted at the left-hand side. To keep the tree balanced, data is reshuffled, which is an expensive operation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, we are defining partitions. In our case, we are using the simplest definition possible: A &lt;code&gt;PARTITION BY RANGE&lt;/code&gt; on the primary key column. We are making bins of 10.000 rows each, because that is convenient for our demonstration here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;three-processes&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#three-processes&#34;&gt;
	Three processes
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be using the Python multiprocessing module to have three processes, an &lt;code&gt;inserter()&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code&gt;partitioner()&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;dropper()&lt;/code&gt;. All of them are endless loops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The inserter will insert random new data rows into the table as fast as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The partitioner will make sure that we always have a sufficient number of empty new partitions for the inserter to continue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The dropper will limit the number of partitions with data by throwing the oldest partition away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will have small piece of code that starts our processes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nd&#34;&gt;@sql.command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;start_processing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;proc_partition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;partitioner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;proc_partition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;proc_drop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;dropper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;proc_drop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;proc_insert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;inserter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;proc_insert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-inserter&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-inserter&#34;&gt;
	The Inserter
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Inserter is an endless loop that generates two random 64 character strings and inserts a new row into the database. Every 10 rows, we commit, every 1000 rows we print a message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;inserter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without the other two threads, the inserter will generate 10.000 rows and then stop, because there is no &lt;code&gt;MAXVALUE&lt;/code&gt; clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-partitioner&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-partitioner&#34;&gt;
	The Partitioner
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Partitioner is an endless loop that runs an &lt;code&gt;ANALYZE TABLE data&lt;/code&gt; command to refresh the statistics, and then queries &lt;code&gt;INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS&lt;/code&gt; for the five partitions with the highest &lt;code&gt;PARTITION_ORDINAL_POSITION&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are fewer than 5 partitions in total, we generate new partitions no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are not at least 5 partitions with no rows&amp;rsquo; int them, we create new partitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we did nothing, we wait for 1/10th of a second and then check again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new partition gets a range expression with a limit 10.000 values higher than the highest one found, and the partition name is derived from the limit by dividing by 10.000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;create_partition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;next_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;next_limit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cmd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;sa&#34;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;alter table data add partition ( partition &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;next_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt; values less than ( &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;next_limit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;))&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sa&#34;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;cmd = &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cmd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cmd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will simply format and run an &lt;code&gt;ALTER TABLE&lt;/code&gt; statement to add a new partition to the existing table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the checking loop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;partitioner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;

	The Dropper
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dropper structurally mirrors the Partitioner: We have a tiny function to create the actual &lt;code&gt;ALTER TABLE data DROP PARTITION&lt;/code&gt; statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;drop_partition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;partition_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sa&#34;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;cmd = &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cmd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we have an endless loop that basically runs a &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS&lt;/code&gt; and checks the number of partitions that have a non-zero number of &lt;code&gt;TABLE_ROWS&lt;/code&gt;. If it is too many, we drop the one with the lowest number (&amp;ldquo;the first one found&amp;rdquo;, using an appropriate sort order in our SQL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;dropper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;counter = 2000

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once we cross the threshold of p1, the number of empty partitions is no longer low enough and another one is being created:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;counter = 9000
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;counter = 10000
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;create p7 reason: not enough empty partitions
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;cmd = alter table data add partition ( partition p7 values less than ( 70000))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;counter = 11000
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This continues for a while, until we have a sufficient number of data partitions so that we begin dropping, too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;counter = 90000
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;create p15 reason: not enough empty partitions
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;cmd = alter table data add partition ( partition p15 values less than ( 150000))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;drop p1 reason: too many partitions with data
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;cmd = alter table data drop partition p1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;counter = 91000
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;counter = 92000
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the system reaches a stable state and will add and drop partitions in sync with the Inserter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From inside SQL we can see the number of rows in the table rise, and then suddenly drop by 10.000 as we drop a partition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sqlkris@localhost&#34; data-lang=&#34;sqlkris@localhost&#34;&gt;+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
|    89872 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

kris@localhost [kris]&amp;gt; select count(*) from data;
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
|    90122 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.02 sec)

kris@localhost [kris]&amp;gt; select count(*) from data;
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
|    80362 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complete example is available &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/isotopp/mysql-dev-examples/tree/master/mysql-partitions&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;on GitHub.com&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>MySQL: ALTER TABLE for UUID</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/09/22/alter-table-for-uuid.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Sep 2020 16:29:52 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/09/22/alter-table-for-uuid.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A question to the internal &lt;code&gt;#DBA&lt;/code&gt; channel at work: »Is it possible to change a column type from &lt;code&gt;BIGINT&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;VARCHAR &lt;/code&gt;? Will the numbers be converted into a string version of the number or will be it a byte-wise transition that will screw the values?«&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking yielded more information: »The use-case is to have strings, to have UUIDs.«&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have two questions to answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is &lt;code&gt;ALTER TABLE t CHANGE COLUMN c&lt;/code&gt; lossy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;INTEGER AUTO_INCREMENT&lt;/code&gt; vs. &lt;code&gt;UUID&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-alter-table-t-change-column-c-lossy&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#is-alter-table-t-change-column-c-lossy&#34;&gt;
	Is ALTER TABLE t CHANGE COLUMN c lossy?
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ALTER TABLE&lt;/code&gt; is not lossy. We can test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;kris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;primary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;auto_increment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;rows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;affected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can see a number of things here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The conversion is not lossy: We have the same number of records, and the records are still sequences of decimal digits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The order of the output is somehow different. The records which previous showed up in ascending integer order are now showing up in ascending alphabetical order. Given that they are now strings, this is partially logical (if there is an order, it should be alphabetical for strings), and partly mysterious (why is there an order and what happened?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s go through that step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;expensive-alter-table&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#expensive-alter-table&#34;&gt;
	Expensive ALTER TABLE
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALTER TABLE tries to do changes to the table in place, without rewriting the entire table, if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases this is not possible, and then it tries to do it in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases not even that is possible, and then the table is locked, rewritten in full, and unlocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our table change was of the third, most expensive kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ENUM change that extends the ENUM at the end is the least expensive possible change. We just add a new value at the end of the list of possible values for the ENUM. This is a change to the data dictionary, not even touching the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An ENUM change in the middle of the list requires recoding the table. Turning an &lt;code&gt;ENUM(“one”, “three”)&lt;/code&gt; into an &lt;code&gt;ENUM(“one”, “two”, “three”)&lt;/code&gt; is expensive. Turning &lt;code&gt;ENUM(“one”, “three”)&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;ENUM(“one”, “three”, “two”)&lt;/code&gt; is cheap. MySQL stores ENUMs internally as integer, so the expensive change re-encodes all old “three” values from 2 to 3. The cheap change stores “three” as 2, and adds 3 as an encoding for “two” in the data dictionary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;code&gt;ALTER TABLE t ADD index&lt;/code&gt; variants are examples for things happening in the background. They still cost time, but won’t lock. The index will become available only after its creation has finished. There cannot be multiple background operations ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case, we internally and invisibly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lock the original table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a temp table in the new format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read all data from the original table, write it into the new table as an &lt;code&gt;INSERT INTO temptable SELECT ... FROM oldtable&lt;/code&gt; would do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;RENAME TABLE oldtable TO temptable2, temptable TO oldtable; DROP TABLE temptable2;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlock everything and are open for business again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process is safe against data loss: If at any point in time this fails, we drop the temptable and still have the original table, unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This processes temporarily doubles disk usage: For some time, the table to be converted will exist in both variants. It requires an appropriate amount of disk space for the duration of the conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process can be emulated. Locking a production table for conversion for an extended amount of time is not an option. Online Schema Change (OSC) does the same thing, in code, while allowing access to the table. Data changes are captured in the background and mirrored to both versions. Multiple competing implementations of this exist, and we have institutionalized and automated this in the DBA portal at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process does the &lt;code&gt;INSERT ... SELECT ...&lt;/code&gt; thing internally (and so does OSC). That is why the conversion works, and how the conversion works. The rules are the MySQL data type conversion rules, as documented in the manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;there-is-an-order-and-it-changed&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#there-is-an-order-and-it-changed&#34;&gt;
	There is an order, and it changed
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking at the test-&lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; we see there seems to be an order, and it changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an order, because the column I changed was the &lt;code&gt;PRIMARY KEY&lt;/code&gt;. The MySQL InnoDB storage engine stores data in a B+-Tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A B-Tree is a balanced tree. That is a tree in which the path length of the longest path from the root of the tree to any leaf is at most one step longer than the shortest path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So assuming a database with a page size of 16384 bytes (16 KB), as MySQL uses, and assuming index records of 10 bytes (4 byte integer plus some overhead), we can cram over 1500 index records into a single page. Assuming index records of 64 bytes - quite large - we still fit 256 records into one page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get an index tree with a fan-out per level of 100 or more (in our example: 256 to over 1500).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a tree of depth 4, this is good for 100^4 = 100 million records, or in other words, with 4 index accesses we can point-access any record in a table of 100 million rows. Or, in other words, for any realistic table design, an index access finds you a record with at most 4 disk accesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 (or less):
The number of disk accesses to get any record in any table via an index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the InnoDB storage engine, the PRIMARY KEY is a B+-Tree. That is a B-Tree in which the leaves contain the actual data. Since a tree is an ordered data structure, the actual data is stored in primary key order on disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data with adjacent primary key values is likely stored in the same physical page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data with small differences in primary key values is likely stored closer together than data with large differences in primary key values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changing a primary key value changes the physical position of a record. Never change a primary key value (Never &lt;code&gt;UPDATE t SET id = ...&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For an AUTO_INCREMENT key, new data is inserted at the end of the table, old data is closer to the beginning of the table.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MySQL has special code to handle this efficiently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deleting old data is not handled very efficiently. Look into &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/partitioning.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Partitions&lt;/a&gt;

 and think about &lt;code&gt;ALTER TABLE t DROP PARTITION ...&lt;/code&gt; for buffer like structures that need to scale. Also think about proper time series databases, if applicable, or about using Cassandra (they have TTL).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We remember:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In InnoDB the primary key value governs the physical layout of the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that new data is accessed often and old data is accessed less often, using primary keys with an AUTO_INCREMENT value collects all new, hot records in a minimum number of data pages at the end of the table/the right-hand side of the tree. The set of pages the database is accessing a lot is minimal, and most easily cached in memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This design minimizes the amount of memory cache, and maximizes database speed automatically for many common access patterns and workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why it was chosen and optimized for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;random-hash-or-uuid-primary-key&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#random-hash-or-uuid-primary-key&#34;&gt;
	Random, Hash or UUID primary key
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider table designs that assign a primary key in a random way. This would be for any design that uses a primary key that is an actual random number, the output of a cryptographic hash function such as SHA256(), or many UUID generators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using an &lt;code&gt;integer auto_increment primary key&lt;/code&gt;, we are likely to get hot data at the right-hand side, cold data at the left-hand side of the tree. We load hot pages, minimising the cache footprint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2020/09/pk-order.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AUTO_INCREMENT integer primary key controlling data order. Hot data in few pages to the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; side of the tree, minimal cache footprint&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with a random distribution of primary keys over the keyspace, there is no set of pages that is relatively cold. As soon as we hit a key on a page (and for hot keys, we hit them often), we have to load the entire page into memory and keep it there (because there is a hot key in it, and we are likely to hit it again, soon):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;md__image&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2020/09/random-order.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Primary Key values are randomly chosen: Any page contains a primary key that is hot. As soon as it is being accessed, the entire 16 KB page is loaded.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we need a comparatively larger (often: much larger) amount of memory to have a useful cache for this table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In MySQL, numeric integer primary key auto_increment optimizes memory footprint for many workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mysql-provides-a-way-out-uuid_to_bindata-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#mysql-provides-a-way-out-uuid_to_bindata-1&#34;&gt;
	MySQL provides a way out: UUID_TO_BIN(data, 1)
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, MySQL itself produces UUID() values with the UUID function that sort very badly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;uuid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;--------------------------------------+
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;MySQL provides the &lt;code&gt;UUID()&lt;/code&gt; function as an implementation of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;RFC 4122 Version 1 UUIDs&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manual says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first three numbers are generated from the low, middle, and high parts of a timestamp. The high part also includes the UUID version number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fourth number preserves temporal uniqueness in case the timestamp value loses monotonicity (for example, due to daylight saving time).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fifth number is an IEEE 802 node number that provides spatial uniqueness. A random number is substituted if the latter is not available (for example, because the host device has no Ethernet card, or it is unknown how to find the hardware address of an interface on the host operating system). In this case, spatial uniqueness cannot be guaranteed. Nevertheless, a collision should have &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; low probability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having the timestamp in front for printing is a requirement of the standard.
But we need not store it that way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MySQL 8 provides a &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/miscellaneous-functions.html#function_uuid-to-bin&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;UUID_TO_BIN()&lt;/a&gt;

 function, and this function has an optional second argument, swap_flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;»If &lt;code&gt;swap_flag&lt;/code&gt; is 1, the format of the return value differs: The time-low and time-high parts (the first and third groups of hexadecimal digits, respectively) are swapped. This moves the more rapidly varying part to the right and can improve indexing efficiency if the result is stored in an indexed column.«&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;tldr&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#tldr&#34;&gt;
	TL;DR
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you must use a UUID in a primary key&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose MySQL 8.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make it VARBINARY(16).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Store it with UUID_TO_BIN(UUID(), 1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access it with BIN_TO_UUID(col, 1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Iterating schemas over time is not an uncommon thing. Often requirements emerge only after you have data, and then directed action is possible. Consequently, working on existing data, and structuring and cleaning it up is a common task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s example we work with a log table that logged state transitions of things in freeform &lt;code&gt;VARCHAR&lt;/code&gt; fields. After some time the log table grew quite sizeable, and the log strings are repeated rather often, contributing to the overall size of the table considerably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are starting with this table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;CREATE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is, our log table has an &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; field to allow individual row addressing, and then logs the state change of a &lt;code&gt;device_id&lt;/code&gt; at a certain &lt;code&gt;change_time&lt;/code&gt; from an &lt;code&gt;old_state&lt;/code&gt; into a &lt;code&gt;new_state&lt;/code&gt;. The two state fields are &lt;code&gt;varchar(64)&lt;/code&gt; and contain one of some 13 or so different strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe they also contain typos, outdated state codes or other stuff that will later need remapping and cleanup, but in today&amp;rsquo;s example we want to concentrate on the cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;

This is easily done. Using &lt;code&gt;old_state&lt;/code&gt;, and we prepend a &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; column because we want to &lt;code&gt;INSERT ... SELECT ...&lt;/code&gt; this later into a &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; table which will map the string to an &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; value. We will then encode the strings using exactly this value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result strings look good, but something happened to our &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; values. In the original statement they were still good, but in the &lt;code&gt;UNION&lt;/code&gt; they get mangled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data types of the result table are derived from the values and their types in the first result set of the &lt;code&gt;UNION&lt;/code&gt;. And &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; is not a good value to guess anything from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s be more explicit about the types:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;alter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;old_state_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;after&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;old_state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;                     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;new_state_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;after&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;new_state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can now encode by looking up each &lt;code&gt;log.old_state&lt;/code&gt; value in &lt;code&gt;map.state&lt;/code&gt; and returning the matching &lt;code&gt;map.id&lt;/code&gt; value. With this we should be able to construct an &lt;code&gt;UPDATE&lt;/code&gt; statement that fills in the &lt;code&gt;log.old_state_id&lt;/code&gt; column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;old_state_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we update &lt;code&gt;log&lt;/code&gt;, specifically setting each current &lt;code&gt;log.old_state_id&lt;/code&gt; value to whatever is returned as matching, for this row, from the subselect we wrote. We then do the same, again, for the &lt;code&gt;new_state&lt;/code&gt; column. The result is as shown, it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now have two redundant columns and the indexes that go with them, and can drop these. Let&amp;rsquo;s also check the new table structure, and validate the output by joining the id values for resolution against the map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;----+-----------+---------------------+---------------+---------------+
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;rows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that we have to join against the map twice, once for each source column, and that also means we have to rename the map table to get unique names for each usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that&amp;rsquo;s a toy example. Let&amp;rsquo;s do that at scale, using a Python driver implementing exactly this procedure. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/isotopp/mysql-dev-examples/blob/master/mysql-lookups/lookups.py&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Code is on GitHub.com&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/isotopp/mysql-dev-examples/blob/master/mysql-lookups/lookups.py#L95-L102&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;set up our source tables&lt;/a&gt;

 by going over the table creation statements in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/isotopp/mysql-dev-examples/blob/master/mysql-lookups/lookups.py#L19-L23&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;sql_setup list&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also defining a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/isotopp/mysql-dev-examples/blob/master/mysql-lookups/lookups.py#L25-L39&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;list of possible states&lt;/a&gt;

, and in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/isotopp/mysql-dev-examples/blob/master/mysql-lookups/lookups.py#L77-L93&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;data generation loop&lt;/a&gt;

 fill the log table with many state transitions from random devices. Note that we do not really care much about matching source and target states, so the transitions are really random jumps. We commit once every &lt;code&gt;statecount&lt;/code&gt; many rows (once for each device) to make it a bit faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/isotopp/mysql-dev-examples/blob/master/mysql-lookups/lookups.py#L48-L53&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;prepare_log_transformation&lt;/a&gt;

 function we basically add the missing columns and indexes, then in perform_log_transformation, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/isotopp/mysql-dev-examples/blob/master/mysql-lookups/lookups.py#L57-L60&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;populate the map&lt;/a&gt;

 and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/isotopp/mysql-dev-examples/blob/master/mysql-lookups/lookups.py#L62-L68&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;encode the log&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/isotopp/mysql-dev-examples/blob/master/mysql-lookups/lookups.py#L70-L75&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;finish_log_transformation&lt;/a&gt;

, we drop the unneeded columns and also implicitly any indices defined on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my super slow test machine, filling the table with a million rows from a thousand devices yields a 64M data file after 2 minutes. I have some 59M of data, and a bit of empty space:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34; data-lang=&#34;console&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gp&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt; ./lookups.py create-log-data --devicecount &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt; --statecount &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;go&#34;&gt;real	2m9.729s

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So data length went from 59326464 bytes to 48824320 bytes, a reduction to 82.3% of the original size. We could save even more by not using &lt;code&gt;integer&lt;/code&gt; 4-byte values to encode, but for example &lt;code&gt;tinyint unsigned&lt;/code&gt; 1-byte values. On the other hand, that may become a problem later on when we exceed the id-space of the map table as we add new states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, the size of the target &lt;code&gt;log&lt;/code&gt; table is now a function of the row number, as we have no variable length columns anymore. The size of the source table is dependent on the variable length string values as well, so by encoding we also get predictable table sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a map table, and update statements with a subselect, we can encode variable length repeated string values into integer values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also get better data quality, as now only legal values from the map table can be encoded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The transformation requires at least two &lt;code&gt;ALTER TABLE&lt;/code&gt; statements (or matching online schema changes), and one full scan for each column to be encoded. A lot of intermediate disk space is required. This needs planning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>MySQL from a Developers Perspective</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/09/07/mysql-from-a-developers-perspective.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Sep 2020 09:18:16 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/09/07/mysql-from-a-developers-perspective.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So this has turned into a small series, explaining how to work with MYSQL from a developers perspective. This post is intended as a directory for the individual articles. It will be amended and re-dated as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code for the series is also available in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/isotopp/mysql-dev-examples.git&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;isotopp/mysql-dev-examples&lt;/a&gt;

 on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tag &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/tags/#mysqldev&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;#mysqldev&lt;/a&gt;

 will reference all articles from this series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/07/27/mysql-transactions.html&#34;&gt;MySQL Transactions - the physical side&lt;/a&gt;

.
Looking at how MySQL InnoDB handles transactions on the physical media, enabling rollback and commit. Introduces a number of important concepts: The Undo-Log, the Redo-Log, the Doublewrite Buffer, and the corrosponding in memory structures, the Log Buffer and the InnoDB Buffer Pool, as well as the concept of a page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/07/27/mysql-commit-size-and-speed.html&#34;&gt;MySQL Commit Size and Speed&lt;/a&gt;

.
This article has code in Github, in mysql-commit-size/. We benchmark MySQL write speed as a function of number of rows written per commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/07/28/mysql-connection-scoped-state.html&#34;&gt;MySQL Connection Scoped State&lt;/a&gt;

.
Looking at things that are stateful and attached to a MySQL connection, and are lost on disconnect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

This article introduces the concept of &lt;code&gt;TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL&lt;/code&gt; and how pushing things into the Undo-Log, while a necessity to implement &lt;code&gt;ROLLBACK&lt;/code&gt; for a Writer, enables features for a Reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

This article has code in Github, in mysql-transactions-counter. We increment a counter in the database, with multiple concurrent writers, and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;

.
When changing multiple rows, it is possible to take out locks in transactions one by one. Depending on how that is done, it may come to deadlocks, and server-initiated rollbacks. When that happens, the transaction must be retried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/08/02/mysql-deadlocks-with-insert.html&#34;&gt;MySQL Deadlocks with INSERT&lt;/a&gt;


When using the obscure transaction isolation level &lt;code&gt;SERIALIZABLE&lt;/code&gt;, it may happen that a single &lt;code&gt;INSERT&lt;/code&gt; can deadlock. Here is how, and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/08/03/mysql-foreign-keys-and-foreign-key-constraints.html&#34;&gt;MySQL Foreign Keys and Foreign Key Constraints&lt;/a&gt;


When establishing relationships between tables, you are doing this by putting one tables primary keys into another tables columns. Enforcing valid pointers between tables seems like a sexy idea, but is painful, and maybe hurts more than it helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/08/04/mysql-foreign-key-constraints-and-locking.html&#34;&gt;MySQL Foreign Key Constraints and Locking&lt;/a&gt;


Looking at tables with foreign key constraints, we check what happens to table and row locks, and how this is different from before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>MySQL: Generated Columns and virtual indexes</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/09/07/mysql-generated-columns-and-virtual-indexes.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Sep 2020 18:52:18 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/09/07/mysql-generated-columns-and-virtual-indexes.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have had a look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/09/04/mysql-json-data-type.html&#34;&gt;how MySQL 8 handles JSON&lt;/a&gt;

 recently, but with all those JSON functions and expressions it is clear that many JSON accesses cannot be fast. To grab data from a JSON column, you will use a lot of &lt;code&gt;$-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;field&lt;/code&gt; expressions and similar, and without indexes nothing of this will be fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JSON cannot be indexed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But MySQL 8 offers another feature that comes in handy: Generated columns and indexes on those. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the parts, step by step, and how to make them work, because they are useful even outside the context of JSON.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-example-table&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#an-example-table&#34;&gt;
	An example table
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the following example we are going to define a table &lt;code&gt;t1&lt;/code&gt; with an integer id and two integer data fields, &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;. We will be filling it with random integers up to 999 for the data values:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;t1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;primary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;auto_increment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#generated-columns&#34;&gt;
	Generated columns
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A generated column is a column with values that are calculated from a deterministic expression provided in the column definition. It has the usual name and type, and then a &lt;code&gt;GENERATED ALWAYS AS ()&lt;/code&gt; term. The parentheses are part of the syntax and cannot be left off. The &lt;code&gt;GENERATED ALWAYS&lt;/code&gt; is optional, and we are going to leave it off, because we are lazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The column can be &lt;code&gt;VIRTUAL&lt;/code&gt;, in which case the expression is evaluated when reading every time a value is needed, or &lt;code&gt;STORED&lt;/code&gt;, in which case the value is materialized and stored on write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may also contain inline index definitions and a column comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;virtual-generated-columns&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#virtual-generated-columns&#34;&gt;
	VIRTUAL generated columns
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we get our trivial example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was fast - the table definition is changed, but because the column is &lt;code&gt;VIRTUAL&lt;/code&gt;, no data values need to be changed. Instead, the data is calculated on read access. We could have written our sample read as &lt;code&gt;SELECT id, a, b, a+b AS c FROM t1 LIMIT 3&lt;/code&gt; for the same effect, because that is what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may even store that statement in a view and then call it, and that&amp;rsquo;s effectively the same:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The output differs slightly in two places: the estimate given for filtered is different, and the view &amp;ldquo;sees&amp;rdquo; and exposes the definition for &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;a+b&lt;/code&gt; in the reparsed statement in the &amp;ldquo;Note&amp;rdquo; section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further down we will also see how the generated column can be indexed, while the statement expression can not - and that in the end what makes the key difference in performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;stored-generated-columns&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#stored-generated-columns&#34;&gt;
	STORED generated columns
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s flip from &lt;code&gt;VIRTUAL&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;STORED&lt;/code&gt; and see what happens. We drop the old definition of &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;, and re-add the same one, but with a &lt;code&gt;STORED&lt;/code&gt; attribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we looked at the average row length in &lt;code&gt;INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES&lt;/code&gt;, we would see it as a bit longer (but as is usual with I_S.TABLES output for small and narrow tables, the values are a bit off).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also see the &lt;code&gt;ALTER TABLE&lt;/code&gt; now takes actual time, proportional to the table size. What happened is that the values for &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; now get materialized on write, as if we defined a &lt;code&gt;BEFORE INSERT&lt;/code&gt; trigger maintaining the values in &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	Trying to write to a generated column fails (except when it doesn&amp;rsquo;t)

&lt;/h3&gt;

That sounds stupid until you define a view on &lt;code&gt;t1&lt;/code&gt; that includes &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; and is considered updatable - by allowing this construct, it stays updatable, even if it includes &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filling in the correct value is not the same as &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; and does not work:&lt;/p&gt;

	Caution: CREATE TABLE &amp;hellip; AS SELECT vs. generated columns
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already know (I hope) that &lt;code&gt;CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT&lt;/code&gt; is of the devil and should not be used to copy table definitions: It creates a table from the result set of the select statement, which is most definitively not the definition of the original table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen this fail already with indexes and foreign key definitions, and in case you didn&amp;rsquo;t, here is what I mean:&lt;/p&gt;

The definition of &lt;code&gt;broken&lt;/code&gt; has been inferred from the format of the result set, which may or may not have the same types as the base table(s). It also has no indexes and no constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The correct way to copy a table definition is &lt;code&gt;CREATE TABLE ... LIKE ...&lt;/code&gt; and then move the data with &lt;code&gt;INSERT ... SELECT ...&lt;/code&gt;. You still have to move the foreign key constraints manually, though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aww, yes. Okay, the full monty:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;insert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;into&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;t2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;t1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, copying data between tables with generated columns requires a bit more engineering than a mindless &lt;code&gt;INSERT ... SELECT *&lt;/code&gt;. The rules are not unexpected, we have explored them right above, still&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-wrong-data-type&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-wrong-data-type&#34;&gt;
	The wrong data type
    &lt;/a&gt;

As usual, &lt;code&gt;SQL_MODE&lt;/code&gt; was as useless as it was helpful - while it prevented data loss, it did not directly point us into the right direction with its error messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By turning off &lt;code&gt;SQL_MODE&lt;/code&gt; we get the clipped values copied and a bunch of warnings that everybody ignores all the time, anyway, so I guess it&amp;rsquo;s an improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

	Allowed and disallowed functions
    &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the final example above we learn that it is also impossible to change the existing definition of any column that is used by a generated column definition. We need to drop the generated column, change the definition of the base columns and then recreate the generated column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;code&gt;VIRTUAL&lt;/code&gt; columns that is cheap, for &lt;code&gt;STORED&lt;/code&gt; - less so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Records&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Duplicates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Warnings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, adding the index takes time, even if the column &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;VIRTUAL&lt;/code&gt;: For an index we extract the indexed values from the table, sort them and store them together with pointers to the base row in the (secondary) index tree. In InnoDB, the pointer to the base row is always the primary key, so what we get in the index is actually pairs of &lt;code&gt;(c, id)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can prove that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Queries for &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; can be answered from the index. The index is called &lt;em&gt;covering&lt;/em&gt;, it saves us chasing the row pointer and access to the actual row. In an &lt;code&gt;EXPLAIN&lt;/code&gt; we see this being indicated with &lt;code&gt;using index&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Queries for &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; should also be &lt;em&gt;covering&lt;/em&gt;: the queried values are all present in the index so that going to the base row is unnecessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Querying for &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is not covering, so the &lt;code&gt;using index&lt;/code&gt; should be gone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And indeed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;explain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;t1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;G&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As predicted, the final query for &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; cannot be covering and is missing the &lt;code&gt;using index&lt;/code&gt; notice in the Extra column. This is still a good query: it is considering and using the index on &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; - the index alone is just not sufficient to resolve the query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should give us an idea about how to design:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In almost all cases &lt;code&gt;STORED&lt;/code&gt; columns will not be paying off. They use disk space, and still need to evaluate the expression at least once for storage. If indexed, they will use disk space in the index a second time - the column is actually materialized twice, in the table in primary key order and the index in index order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;STORED&lt;/code&gt; generated columns make sense only if the expression is complicated and slow to calculate. But with the set of functions available to us that is hardly going to be the case, ever. So unless the expression is being evaluated really often the cost for the storage is not ever amortized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even then, for generated columns &lt;code&gt;STORED&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;VIRTUAL&lt;/code&gt;, many queries can probably be answered leveraging an index on the generated column so that we might try to get away with &lt;code&gt;VIRTUAL&lt;/code&gt; columns all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The optimizer is aware of the generated column definitions, and can leverage them, as long as they match:&lt;/p&gt;

	Summary
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been looking at the two flavors of generated columns, and how they can make our life easier in many ways. We have been looking at various pitfalls with respect to copying data and table definitions around. We have been learning about indexing generated columns, and how the optimizer can leverage indexes even against the expressions defined in generated columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we put the parts together and made JSON data lookups fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should give us a number of ideas in terms of sensible table design around JSON. Often we use JSON for variable-ish data while we explore a data model. Then a JSON schema solidifies, and we can leverage values we require and rely on by putting them into generated columns and index these, then use these for search and access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually we may extract the columns from the variable JSON part of the schema completely and turn them into actually statically typed columns of the SQL schema, because we require them all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These open up a pathway to incremental schema design while at the same time being flexible enough to have bag style soft and denormalized data types where we need them.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-fine-manual&#34;&gt;
	The Fine Manual
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot more to all of this than I can show here. This means you have homework. Read the following manual pages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-table-generated-columns.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CREATE TABLE and Generated Columns&lt;/a&gt;


The basics in a single page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-table-secondary-indexes.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Secondary Indexes and Generated Columns&lt;/a&gt;


Indexing generated columns, with special considerations on indexing JSON&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/generated-column-index-optimizations.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Optimizer Use of Generated Column Indexes&lt;/a&gt;


We all love to hate the optimizer, but it has learned a lot of new tricks. Here&amp;rsquo;s what it does understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CREATE INDEX statement and &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-index.html#create-index-multi-valued&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;multi valued indexes&lt;/a&gt;


The entire page is useful, because it speaks about functional indexes and how they are implemented as hidden virtual columns and indexes on these (which has implications). But within the discussion of JSON, the interesting part are Multi-Valued Indexes, which are indexes on non-scalar values such as JSON arrays, and how they are being used to speed up certain JSON functions that deal with array membership and overlaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;MySQL 8 provides solid support for the JSON data type. The manual has &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/json.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;an overview of the data type&lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We learn several things from this experiment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Literal JSON values are always simple strings.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The character set in JSON objects is &lt;code&gt;utf8mb4&lt;/code&gt;, the collation is &lt;code&gt;utf8mb4_bin&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because the collation is a &lt;code&gt;_bin&lt;/code&gt; collation, comparison is case-sensitive. Charset and collation are fixed and cannot be changed without casting to a non-JSON type.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We enclose them in single quotes, leveraging the fact that MySQL allows both single and double quotes as string terminators. This saves us a lot of quoting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JSON null is written as the string &lt;code&gt;&#39;null&#39;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JSON true is written as the string &lt;code&gt;&#39;true&#39;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JSON false is written as the string &lt;code&gt;&#39;false&#39;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We allowed NULL values in our JSON column definition by not providing a &lt;code&gt;NOT NULL&lt;/code&gt; clause. SQL &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; is different from JSON &lt;code&gt;&#39;null&#39;&lt;/code&gt;, but is cast to this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can use the &lt;code&gt;JSON_TYPE()&lt;/code&gt; function to check the JSON type inside the JSON column.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The JSON is parsed, and checked for validity. The &lt;code&gt;JSON_VALID()&lt;/code&gt; function does the checking.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It also exposes the difference between SQL &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; and JSON &lt;code&gt;&#39;null&#39;&lt;/code&gt;. So does the SQL &lt;code&gt;ISNULL()&lt;/code&gt; function (or the &lt;code&gt;IS NULL&lt;/code&gt; comparison operator).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see JSON literal notation already from the previous example. There are also two utility functions to construct JSON array and object structures from SQL scalars. They are &lt;code&gt;JSON_ARRAY()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;JSON_OBJECT()&lt;/code&gt;. Note the handling of SQL &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quotes and quoting can be a bit painful, and even confusing. Let&amp;rsquo;s put the string &lt;code&gt;A so-called &amp;quot;string&amp;quot;.&lt;/code&gt; into a JSON string, inside an SQL statement. To turn this text into a JSON string we need to put double quotes around it, quoting our internal double quotes with backslashes. To produce a backslash literal, we need to write a double backslash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;json-component-access&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#json-component-access&#34;&gt;
	JSON component access
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;JSON_EXTRACT()&lt;/code&gt; function and JSON path syntax, we can access fields in the JSON and select for them, as foreshadowed above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get the following selectors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;, the current JSON document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;.key&lt;/code&gt;, select the &lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt; from the current object. Use &lt;code&gt;.&amp;quot;key with space&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; when necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;[N]&lt;/code&gt; selects the element &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; from a JSON array, starting to count at 0.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;.&amp;quot;equipment-ids&amp;quot;[1]&lt;/code&gt; is interesting, because we need to quote &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;equipment-ids&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; due to the dash in the key name. We must not put the array index into the quotes, though, or it won&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For an array slice, the syntax is &lt;code&gt;[M to N]&lt;/code&gt; for the slice from &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; inclusive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For arrays, the keyword &lt;code&gt;last&lt;/code&gt; is the rightmost element in the array.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are wildcards:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;.*&lt;/code&gt; are all values of a JSON object, as an array.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;[*]&lt;/code&gt; are all the values of a JSON array, as an array.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt; are all paths that lead to a suffix.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, put into practice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;insert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;into&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;{&amp;#34;id&amp;#34;: 10, &amp;#34;login&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;kris&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;fullname&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;Kristian \\&amp;#34;Isotopp\\&amp;#34; Köhntopp&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;equipment-ids&amp;#34;: [10, 11, 12], &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34;:{ &amp;#34;equipment-ids&amp;#34;: [1,2,3]}}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

 provides a type cast from JSON to SQL, making extracted JSON values available to SQL comparisons and conditions. Follow the link and look it up. There is no &lt;code&gt;INTEGER&lt;/code&gt;, you have to be more specific, &lt;code&gt;SIGNED&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;UNSIGNED&lt;/code&gt;, the types match the ones used in &lt;code&gt;CAST()&lt;/code&gt;. There are also &lt;code&gt;ON EMPTY&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ON ERROR&lt;/code&gt; clauses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;JSON_VALUE()&lt;/code&gt; we can do the work of &lt;code&gt;JSON_EXTRACT()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;JSON_UNQUOTE()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CAST()&lt;/code&gt; in one go, and have control about handling of non-existent paths (&lt;code&gt;ON EMPTY&lt;/code&gt;) and conversion errors (&lt;code&gt;ON ERROR&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could have used cast as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reusing the example above, we can try to update the payment status of a user using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/json-modification-functions.html#function_json-set&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;JSON_SET()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functions in MySQL expect types, and convert to these types. &lt;code&gt;JSON_SET()&lt;/code&gt; expects JSON, so we do it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/json-modification-functions.html#function_json-remove&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;JSON_REMOVE()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

, &amp;ldquo;Removes data from a JSON document&amp;rdquo;. There are also &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/json-modification-functions.html#function_json-set&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;JSON_SET()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

, and friends:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/json-modification-functions.html#function_json-set&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;JSON_SET()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

 replaces existing values and adds nonexistent values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/json-modification-functions.html#function_json-insert&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;JSON_INSERT()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

 inserts values without replacing existing values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/json-modification-functions.html#function_json-replace&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;JSON_REPLACE()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

 replaces only existing values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the basic tools we need to get JSON into and out of tables. We now just need to make it fast - the stuff for another article.&lt;/p&gt;
