[War Factory](https://www.amazon.de/War-Factory-Transformation-Book-English-ebook/dp/B018XV0AFW)
is the second of three Books in Neal Ashers 
[Transformation Sequence](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B0725J2WXN/ref=series_rw_dp_sw),
a trilogy set in his [Polity Universe](https://plus.google.com/+KristianK%C3%B6hntopp/posts/iAxsVw1j9WZ)

The storyline continues with the characters and themes of the first book -
it's about atonement and redemption. And as we learn, not just about the
redemption of the mad AI Penny Royal, but also about the aftermath of the
Human-Prador war and the redemption of the various persons (Human, Haiman,
Prador and AI) that have been damaged by the war. We see in fact a lot more
of the prador, and how the war affected them personally, and as a society.

The pacing is still slow in places, and not a lot of plot is happening, but
there is a lot of background and development. Considering that this is the
bridge book in a trilogy, it's actually pretty good and satisfying. 

"[War Factory](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B018XV0AFW)", Neal Asher, EUR 5.99
