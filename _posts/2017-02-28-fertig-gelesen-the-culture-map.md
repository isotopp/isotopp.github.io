[The Culture Map](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B06XCGTKL8)

[Erin Meyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Meyer) is a professor at INSEAD,
an international business school based in Paris. She's specialized in
cross-cultural communication and facilitation, and in her book explains the
dimensions and differences between different cultures in the world, and how
they can shape or interfere with exchanges in a multi-cultural environment.

The book introduces eight different cultural scales or spectra, and where
the various national cultures position themselves on these scales.

Each of the eight scales represents one key area that managers must be
aware of, showing how cultures vary along a spectrum from one extreme to its
opposite. The eight scales are:

- Communicating: low-context vs. high-context 
- Evaluating: direct negative feedback vs. indirect negative feedback 
- Persuading: principles-first vs. applications-first 
- Leading: egalitarian vs. hierarchical 
- Deciding: consensual vs. top-down
- Trusting: task-based vs. relationship-based
- Disagreeing: confrontational vs. avoids confrontation
- Scheduling: linear-time vs. flexible-time

The book is rich in examples and anecdotes that explain what these scales
mean, and how they can express themselves in daily interaction. For each
direction of each scale, examples and alternative ways of communication are
shown, which have been working around issues that other groups have used
successfully in trying to bridge the gap in culture between them. 

A lot of helpful advice and a lot of context provided for past behaviour I
have observed at work or elsewhere.
