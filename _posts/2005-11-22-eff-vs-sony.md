[EFF Files Class Action Lawsuit Against Sony BMG](http://www.eff.org/news/archives/2005_11.php):

> The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), along with two leading national
> class action law firms, today filed a lawsuit against Sony BMG, demanding
> that the company repair the damage done by the First4Internet XCP and
> SunnComm MediaMax software it included on over 24 million music
> CDs....Both the XCP and MediaMax CDs include outrageous, anti-consumer
> terms in their "clickwrap" EULAs. For example, if purchasers declare
> personal bankruptcy, the EULA requires them to delete any digital copies
> on their computers or portable music players. The same is true if a
> customer's house gets burglarized and his CDs stolen, since the EULA
> allows purchasers to keep copies only so long as they retain physical
> possession of the original CD. EFF is demanding that Sony BMG remove these
> unconscionable terms from its EULAs.

Wohl denen, die ihre Musik sicherheitshalber lieber eseln. Da sind die
Risiken leichter einzuschätzen.
