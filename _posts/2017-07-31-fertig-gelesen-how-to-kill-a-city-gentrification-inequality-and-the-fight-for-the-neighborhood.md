In [How to Kill a City](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B06XKSMZDP)
[Peter Moskowitz](https://petermoskowitz.com/) takes severals
US example cities to show the general process of Gentriciation
and the individual differences. We get to know the development
stories of New Orleans, Detroit, San Francisco and New York, in
order to better understand the mechanism and root causes of
Gentrification, which is not about Hipsters and Latte at all,
but about rent seeking, backroom dealing to change the law, and - 
specifically in the US - also about the history and
perpetuation of racism.

Moskowitz, living in and loving New York, is deeply partisan,
as he has been witnessing the slow destruction and
transformation of the neighborhood of his youth, but he has his
facts straight and reasons solidly. If you want to understand
what "Gentrification" means and how it is sown before it starts
and grows to eat a Neighborhood, this book is a good starting
place.
