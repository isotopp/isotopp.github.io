The Blockchain is the solution to everything, and especially the
problem of the state. So or similar goes the hype. This book
attacks that hype, and it's fun to read.

It very briefly (one chapter of many) and rather easily
understandable explains what Merkle trees and eternal logfiles
are, how they are different from the blockchain, what 'proof of
work' actually means.
 
It then goes on and actually takes apart the libertarian
politics bullshit on top of that, by going through all the
history of people and "businesses" connected to Bitcoin,
Ethereum and the likes. It is full of stories how they failed,
were busted, or simply neglected basic necessities.

The book nicely separates out the useful tech part from the
political propaganda, and deflates the entire hype around it
(Hint: Most people want Merkle trees and a trusted institution,
but think they need a Blockchain - they will end up with a
blockchain, a centralized institution and a large energy bill).
 
Very much recommended, and also a nice present to give to the
geek next to you who is exposed to libertarian propaganda
bullshit and needs immunization.
