In 1982, [Scott Fahlmann invented the use of :-) and :-(](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sef/Orig-Smiley.htm) 
for marking up emotions or semantic context in written online communication.
That was a great idea.

The :-) is just a symbol for an emotion.

It is specifically not a human face, it does not have a hair color, eye
color, skin color or other human attributes. It is universal. Then some
cellphone maker turned that into ![](/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2018-04-13-at-10.01.46.png),
anthropomorphising it.

Come as it must, we soon get color, and it turns into 😀. That Simpsons
yellow was read by some as white and non-inclusive, and here is where things
start to break down. 

Because the logical thing would be to stop here and revert back to
![](/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2018-04-13-at-10.01.46.png).

But that is not what the Unicode consortium did. They went this way:

![](/uploads/2017/11/emoji-of-color.png)

The Fitzpatrick Scale of skin colors inspired the U+1F3FB - U1F3FF suffixes
for skin toned Emoji.

That was not a good thing. How do I know? In the wake of this change we got
articles like 
[Why White People Don’t Use White Emoji](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/white-people-dont-use-white-emoji/481695/)
and
[Kendall Jenner is being accused of cultural appropriation for using the 'wrong' emoji](http://www.businessinsider.com/kendall-jenner-used-darker-emoji-than-her-skin-tone-2017-8?IR=T).
That is, something that was supposed to be an annotation for conveying
emotion became not only anthropomorphised to the point where that meaning is
overshadowed by race, gender and culture issues. We are considering a full
modification system for Emoji, in the (withdrawn)
[TR52](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr52/tr52-1.html#Gender_Attribute).

Taking this to the logical conclusion, what we get is this:

![](/uploads/2017/11/skyrim-character-editor-640x350.jpg)

Skyrim Character Editor

That is, someone is taking the point of writing out of writing and is trying
to
[put all the expression of a video chat or video game](https://www.reallusion.com/iclone/game/)

into a single glyph. Coming back to the withdrawn TR52: we just got FROWNING
PILE OF POO: 

![](/uploads/2017/11/frowning-pile-of-poo.png)

[Frowning pile of poo](https://emojipedia.org/frowning-pile-of-poo/) clearly has race
issues.

We also get Emoji with hair colors and hair styles in 
[Emoji 6.0](https://emojipedia.org/emoji-6.0/). And people in the Unicode
consortium are
[not amused about the pile of poo with facial expressions](http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2017/17393-wg2-emoji-feedback.pdf),
but while valid, it's missing the larger point. What people actually would
need is most likely something more like universal
[Giphy](https://giphy.com/) integration and less Skyrim character editor for
Emoji. Sadly, nobody in the Unicode consortium is trying to fix this, and so
we get a lot of symbol pollution in a thing that was supposed to be a
writing system.
