Today I was looking for a way to subscribe to file changes in a directory in
MacOS, in order to trigger automatically running commands whenever files
change. Turns out Homebrew has "fswatch", which tells you when things
change, but little else.

Turns out Homebrew has "watchman", which does all this, and on multiple
trees, finds changes across restarts and automatically manages a set of
commands for different file endings. 

Also turns out that I know the author. Thanks, Wez!
