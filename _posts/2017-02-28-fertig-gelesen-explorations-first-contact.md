[Explorations: First Contact](https://www.amazon.de/Explorations-Contact-English-Isaac-Hooke-ebook/dp/B01NCUWEF8)
is a great concept well executed: This is a writing prompt anthology. So
there is a base story - in this case, humanity sends a probe to the back
side of the moon, finds an anomaly which turns out to be a dying alien
spaceship that manages to upload the secrets of it's drive and a partial
database of other alien civilisations it once visited into the minds of the
astronauts that make the contact.

With this information, earth builds a number of spaceships - one per
anthology author - each of which heads off into a different direction to
make a first contact between humanity and the alien. We get 13 takes on the
topic of first contact, 13 authors, and 13 short stories. They start off
with the same backstory, and the crews and ships reference each other
loosely in the writeup, even if there are slight inconsistencies in
timeline, human history backstory or drive speed and tech power. The stories
vary in quality and originality, but are all on the better side of short
story writing, and the concept is novel and entertaining. The delivery is
well done.

Recommended, and since this seems to be a series of writing prompt
anthology, research the others as well.
