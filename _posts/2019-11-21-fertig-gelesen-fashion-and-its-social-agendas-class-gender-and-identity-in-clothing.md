[Fashion and Its Social Agendas: Class, Gender, and Identity in Clothing](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00D3GOTZK)
by Diane Crane is an analysis of the changes in society during
the various phases of the industrial revolution through the lens
of clothing in various societal strata.

The book studies fashion and clothing choices in three countries - 
France, the United States, and England - over a period of 150
years. France and England are examples of class societies in the
nineteenth century. It has available four sets of data:
Interviews and inventories of clothing in a large number of
households the above countries, spaced out over an extended
period of time. The long timescale and the temporal distance
between the various studies allow comparison across major events
(such as the Franco-Prussian war) and as industrialisation plays
out.

This is not a book for reading, it is a study, full of
footnotes, tables, cross references and sections that demand
note-taking. It is also interesting, because it shows how
materials, production cost, societal change and changing gender
roles change the role of fashion and how it is being used in
society. Hard work, bit damn interesting.
