[Coaching, Beratung und Gehirn](https://www.amazon.de/Coaching-Beratung-Gehirn-Neurobiologische-Ver-nderungskonzepte-ebook/dp/B01F3AVX98/)

The authors are [Gerhard Roth](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerhard_Roth_(Biologe)) 
(a biologist and neurologist) and [Alica Ryba](http://www.aryba.de/profil.html) (a coach,
student of Roth). Roth describes the neurobiology as we know it today, and
Ryba and he connect it to the various theories of psychotherapy that are
relevant today in clinical practice and in coaching, discussing what can and
can't possibly work.

For what can work, they establish the limits of change. Also, they try to
differentiate clinical psychotherapy from (the psychotherapeutic parts of)
coaching in method, foundation and goals.

All in all a nice overview, and a good way of learning to understand what
happens in coaching, what coaches are trying to do with you or your group in
an enterprise context and how to tell good from badly executed coaching. For
me a very useful and enlightening read that gave me a lot of tools and
understanding.
