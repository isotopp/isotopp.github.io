The story begins as a Fantasy novel in a magical universe: We
have two warring factions of magicians, a dragon attack, Gnomes
and other entities from the fables and fairy tales.

We also have Rowan, the Steerswoman. She is more than a
navigator and map maker, she's part of a group of people that
believes in science, in documentation and in open sources - the
steerswomen. When a Steerswoman asks, you must answer, and
truthfully. If you ask any Steerswoman, she'll also answer to
the best of her knowledge and truthfully. As a group, they are
gathering information about the world they live in.

And as it becomes apparent to the reader quite quickly, that
world is an alien planet with a hostile and incompatible
biology, that is slowly transformed into a world that is more
amenable to humans and life from Earth. All of this is unknown
to Rowan and her people, because the knowledge about their
origin and much science has been lost and they fell back to an
almost medieval level of living. So this entire series is about
Open Sources, about the Scientific Method and progress in a
world of Magic and Fantasy, about Clarke's law. It is also about
a Xenobiology and The Alien and about many more things.

Above all, it's about the characters, which are living and alive
in a way that is not unlike the inhabitants of
[Pern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pern_books). And
not unlike Pern, but in a much more nuanced and interesting way,
this is about ecology, human and xeno, too. Well written and
fascinating - don't start this series without having the time to
read, because you will want to go through all available books in
the shortest possible time. 

[The Steerswoman Series](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00XM2JF4A) is
incomplete, four books are out, and two are still being written.
Book 6 is almost complete and the title is known 
([The City in the Crags](http://www.rosemarykirstein.com/tag/the-city-in-the-crags/))
and Book 5 is in the making and will be published "when it is
ready".

[The Steerswoman](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B00HH1U8Z2/), first
book in the eponymous series, starts out with Rowan taking a
kind of break in her mapmaking tasks to investigate the origin
of some strange black stones or shards with strange bluish,
patterned lines on them.

The book establishes the world Rowan lives in, and a small bit
of history: One of the strangely stationary moons of the world,
the Guidestars, has fallen and is now gone. We learn about the
inhabitants of the world, humans and wizards, but there are also
Gnomes, Dragons and Demons. We learn about the lay of the land,
the Inner Lands, where Rowan lives, and the Outskirts, which are
full of many strange creatures (such as the Demons) and which
are a hostile environment in which humans can barely persist.

[The Outskirter's Secret](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B00J89CKQ6)
explores this in more depth, as Rowan wants to find the fallen
Guidestar and the origin of the strange stones. She's also in
for a tour of the native biology of the strange planet humanity
lives on, and is slowly gaining an understanding of how The
Outskirts work and slowly turning the planet into a world that
can sustain Earth life. She's also learning how different the
lives and the culture of the Outskirters are from the ways of
the Inner Lands, and how their world is shaped by necessity and
the harshness of the land. In the end, Rowan and us both gain a
good idea on what has happened four decades ago when the
Guidestar fell.

[The Lost Steersman](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00J8BY6CU) takes
Rowan back to the Inner Lands, at least originally, and then to
the sea, as Rowan searches for the mysterious wizard Slado, who
seemed to be responsible for the fall of the Guidestar. We also
meet Janus, an Ex-Steersman, who seems to be connected and who
also seems to be involved in the Demon attacks on the city of
Alemeth, where he lives. When the Demons come to get him, Rowan
follows him out to the sea, behind the border of the Outskirts
and the Dolphin Stairs into the native lands of the Demons.

Kirstein does an excellent job of painting The Alien as that,
alien. Intelligent, but strange and so far removed that
communication is almost impossible, but for one brief 
[Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Darmok_(episode))
moment. Also, map-making Rowan finally understands the true size
of the world she is living in and how tiny and fragile the human
settlement on it actually is.

[The Language of Power](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00JTNDL0A) 
takes Rowan back to the Inner Lands after she understood that
the Demon plague has not been orchestrated by Slado and that her
enemy is to be found within the human part of her homeworld. In
the city of Donner, she's planning on learning more about the
wizards and their ways, and she has brilliant help. Because her
grenade throwing proto magician whizkid from the start of the
series has grown up, and he's been learning programming
languages.
