So Python is a beautiful language, which is also kind of slow. And the
more cores you have, the worse it gets, because of the
[GIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_interpreter_lock) in the
most popular implementations. Other languages are much better at
concurrency, one of them supposedly being Go. So Geeks at Google have been
pondering the problem, and came up with a Python-to-Go compiler called
Grumpy. 

Read more about it 
[in their blog](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2017/01/grumpy-go-running-python.html).
In rigged benchmarks it looks awesome, and under real world load it
supposedly performs quite well.

But the best part is the Logo. Which looks like this:
