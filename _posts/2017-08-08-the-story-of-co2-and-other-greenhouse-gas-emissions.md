[Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions/)
has a very nice long read with many interactive visualisations giving
context to CO2.

We begin with exploring CO2 cumulative (how much CO2 did each nation produce
over its industrial history), scaling it to annual emission and then scaling
it by population, too. We also learn about CO2 produced vs. CO2 in the
atmosphere, which is a delayed system.

The second part then deals with CO2 and industrialisation: Emission vs.
Properity, vs. Growth, and also with CO2 from trade and transport, and from
meat production. As always with Our World in Data, the article concludes
with Definitions, Methods and pointers to raw data sources.
