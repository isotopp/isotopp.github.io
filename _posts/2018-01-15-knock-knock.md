What does your Mac do on Startup? [Knockknock knows](https://github.com/synack/knockknock). 

It's not properly updated for current versions of MacOS, but it is still
useful. "git clone https://github.com/synack/knockknock" and
"/usr/bin/python knockknock.py" is sufficient to test. 

```console
TOTAL ITEMS FOUND: 44
```

That's quite a bit. Apparently, I am starting

- Google Music Manager,
- AirServer,
- Karabiner,
- Alfred 3,
- a Chrome app\_mode\_loader,
- the Android File Transfer Agent,
- Dropbox, Divvy,
- Expandrive,
- Chrome itself,
- Soundflower,
- an AX88179 USB GBit Ethernet adapter driver,
- Steam Drivers,
- /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/org.chromium.chromoting.me2me.sh,
- the Steam ipcserver,
- the Expandrive Helper,
- the Skype Helper,
- the OnePasswordNativeMessageHost,
- Expandrive exfs,
- iStatMenus and
- the iStatMenus Agents and Helpers,
- Steamclean,
- the GoogleSoftwareUpdateAgent,
- Tunnelblick LaunchAtLogin.sh,
- and finally an ethcheck Firmware checker.

So much Crap being loaded.
