It's not my fault, really. It's
[Schenker](https://www.mysn.de/xmg-gaming-desktop-pcs/xmg-prime), and 
[Urban Games](http://store.steampowered.com/app/446800/Transport_Fever/). 
They sent me my Nvidia 1070 (with a side of CPU and Memory), and now there
is a Windows Shoebox (well, Clown Shoe sized showbox) somewhere in our home,
and Steam Streaming is busy. I'm off 
[laying tracks](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=816733942)
with the family, now the screen updates are not jumpy any more.
