It is helpful to remember that containers are just normal Unix
processes with two special tricks.

## Normal Unix Processes

Unix starts processes by performing a `fork()` system call to
create a new child process.

The child process still contains the same program as the parent
process, so the parent processes program still has control over
the child. It usually performs a number of operations within the
context of the new child, preparing the environment for the new
program, from within.

PID 17 forks, and creates a new process with PID 18. This
process executes a copy of the original program.

Then, after the environment is complete, the parent program
within the child processes context replaces itself by calling
`execve()`. This system call unloads the current program in a
process and reuses the process to load a new program into
it.

After bash in PID 18 has setup the environment correctly, it
replaces itself with the actual command to run, `/bin/ls`. The
code for that is being loaded from disk into memory.

When the program in a process has finished, it terminates itself
with an `exit()` system call. The parameter to `exit()` is the
status code. 

The parent process waits for the end of the child program using
a `wait()` system call. When the child exits, the parents
`wait()` call returns, and delivers the status code of the child's
`exit()` invokation to the parent.

Child PID 18 terminates by calling `exit()` with a status code.
Parent PID waits for the termination of the child, returning the
status code of the child through the `wait()` system call.

## Special Trick: Isolation

Containers are Linux processes that are set up two special kinds
of resource barriers:

- Linux Namespaces, which limit which kind of system objects a
  process can see. There are seven Linux Namespaces. Six of them
  are explained in a good 
  [series on Namespaces in LWN](https://lwn.net/Articles/531114/), 
  and the [Linux Namespaces Manpage](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html)
  explains all seven of them, including the new
  [cgroup](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroup_namespaces.7.html)
  Namespace. Namespaces can provide a process with its own set of
  network resources, including a private ethernet interface with
  addresses, a local routing table instance and a local iptables
  rules instance. Namespaces can provide processes with its own
  view of the filesystem as well, limiting it to a certain
  subtree of the host filesystem and also limiting the effects
  of mount() system calls executed by the process.
- [Control Groups (cgroups)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html),
  which limit how much of a given resource that is visible to a
  process this process can consume. Control Groups have been
  subject to a major redesign in the most recent kernels, see
  [this talk]({% link _posts/2017-02-07-fosdem-talk-cgroups-v2.md %}).

Both resource barriers set up processes in a way that they
cannot reach beyond the established borders: 

Two processes in different namespaces that are correctly set up
cannot see each other and can believe they are alone on a
machine. At the same time they cannot deplete each other of host
machine resources, because the control groups prevent that if
correctly set up and sized, minimising crosstalk between the two
processes.

The combination of Namespaces and Cgroups forming a resource
barrier is called a **Pod** in Kubernetes. 

For all practical purposes, the Pod has the same
resource-isolation effect that a VM has, but unlike a VM it does
consume practically no resources. Inside a Pod, zero or more
processes may be running. 

Processes running inside a Pod are still normal Linux processes
executing normal system calls (within the limits that namespaces
and cgroups impose on them), so they will be just as fast as
regular processes.

Also, Processes sharing a Pod can see each other and touch each
other, just like regular processes running on a physical or
virtual machine. This allows co-scheduling of processes inside a
Pod - Kubernetes calls containers doing this "Composite
Containers" and 
[there are a number of deployment patterns and use-cases for these](http://blog.kubernetes.io/2015/06/the-distributed-system-toolkit-patterns.html).

## Special Trick: Images

If you want to execute something in a filesystem namespace in a
Pod, you need to build a stub operating system inside the
subtree that is visible inside the Pod. By default, a filesystem
namespace will limit the Pod and all processes inside the Pod to
certain subdirectory, not unlike a `chroot()` environment.

By default this subdirectory will be empty. In order to be able
to run things with this as a root directory, the necessary
minimum of files needs to be present. This can be done by
copying the necessary files into the environment, or by
installing a stub operating system from packages into the
environment, but both processes may end up copying a few hundred
or even thousands of files into the target environment.

**Filesystem images** are files that contain the block structure
of a device inside a file. Using loop mounts, the file can be
interpreted by the Operating System as a device, creating a file
tree. With this concept, an entire environment can be copies
into place using a single file, and then mounting that.

Building these files can be pretty complicated, though, and
these files can also become quite large - and if you have
multiple of these environments, they will also duplicate quite a
bit of content: Each container will require a copy of the C
standard library and many other system files that are simply
shared between almost all containers. 

Container systems often address this problem by defining the
contents of an image as an assembly of **Layers**. A layer is
simply a tar file that is being downloaded and unpacked on top
of other, earlier downloads so that the total resulting image is
the union of all layers stacked on top of each other.

Because it can become necessary for a higher layer to
effectively delete files or directories contained in lower
layers, there needs to be a mechanism that transports this
information. Docker images use an awfully designed mechanism
called "whiteout files" for that. Basically, if the tar contains
a dotfile starting with the four letters ".wh." (that's for
"whiteout", Tippex), a file of the same name as the suffix of
the whiteout file will be blocked out from a lower layer. 

So if you unpack `/etc/.wh.passwd`, this will block out
`/etc/passwd` from a lower layer.

Images can be written to. Writes will always go into the topmost
layer.

## Putting it all together: Kubernetes

Original Docker is a tool that has been created with developer
concerns in mind and zero regard for operations. Docker can run
containers on a single host, and has no idea about networking at
all - it uses the single IP address a host has, and exposes
ports of processes on the inside using iptables rules that
merrily map ports between the physical host and the view of the
world inside containers. 

Docker builds images rather quickly by un-tar-ing layers on top
of each other, and because writes are always going to the
topmost layer and that layer can be discarded, it is also easily
possible to undo all writes after a run and get back the
pristine image for a new run. 

This makes it ideal for running tests. 

Docker in production is another matter - usually production is
larger than a single host, and usually production workloads are
being addressed by proper networking equipment which does not so
much deal with port numbers as with IP addresses instead. 

So production docker usually needs an IP address per pod, some
kind of routing and networking isolation layer for all of that,
and it needs a thing that takes requests to run images and
assigns a physical host to each image.

Images are handy - they package a piece of software with all
dependencies, and allow us to start processes on any host in a
multihost cluster without installing additional software. 

So the following can becomes possible:


![](/uploads/2017/02/cluster-1.png)

A cluster with a number of kubernetes nodes, and three
kubernetes master instances. One has been elected
leader.

We have a cluster with a number of physical hosts, all of which
are capable of retrieving images and launching containers.
Multiple cluster masters exist, one of which has been elected
leader and executes the actual scheduling function. 

![](/uploads/2017/02/cluster-2.png)

A scheduling request arrives, basically asking us to start this
image on a host.

The cluster accepts scheduling requests, asking the cluster to
pick up a certain image which has the following requirements on
CPU, memory, disk and network I/O, and find a spot to run it.
The scheduler surveys the cluster, finds such a spot and then
asks the cluster node to do just that: Set up a pod, download
and assemble the image and then launch the process with the
image inside that Pod. 

![](/uploads/2017/02/cluster-3.png)

The worker will now download the image layers, assemble the
final image, create a Pod and launch a process from that image
inside that pod.

The end result is a process that sees one single, private
network interface and runs inside a set of Resource Barriers
that form the Pod. The program code for the process as well as
all libraries or other data is container inside the image.

![](/uploads/2017/02/cluster-4.png)

Code from the image is running inside the resource barriers
create by the Pod.

By installing software including all dependencies inside the
image we are not polluting our base operating system image. Once
the execution of that workload finishes, we can "uninstall"
everything simply by deleting the image (and its constituent
layers).

We can create a cluster that represents a large amount of
compute power in the form of CPU cores, memory, disk space and
network I/O and have one single scheduler to run arbitrary
applications that have been packaged in images on it. The
cluster scheduler takes care of workload placement, and as long
as we have sufficient capacity we can hand out compute power as
needed without caring where exactly in our datacenter that
capacity is available - if our datacenter is built in a way that
can support this kind of use and if our application is built in
a way that it can handle such an environment.
