The German Language podcast Lage der Nation has published an 
[interview with Axel Friedrich](https://www.kuechenstud.io/lagedernation/2017/07/25/ldn-sommerinterview-1-axel-friedrich-zu-diesel-gate/)
on Dieselgate. Axel Friedrich has been a department lead in the German
Umweltbundesamt until 2008, now working with BUND and other environmental
NGOs in Germany and instrumental in uncovering Dieselgate on the German
side.

The interview contains some very interesting remarks on rental car companies
and car maker owned car leasing companies, and how the shape the car market.
A deprecation of Diesel cars by those leasing companies is instrumental to
transforming the car maret and in promoting the shift to BEVs.

Similar, but different concerns from Bloomberg in 
[Europe’s Car-Leasing Boom Sets Off Alarm Bells](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-30/auto-debt-risk-spreads-to-europe-as-leases-create-used-car-glut).

Basically, cars are valuable things and are being used to secure loans and
bonds, and are also bought on loans and bonds where the intrinsic value of
the vehicle is being used to secure the load for buying it. Changes in the
price of used cars by shifts in how cars are bought (In the future, less
people want to own a car) and which cars have value (In the future, Diesel
will be close to worthless and people want to buy BEVs) are threats to
credit security and to the financial business around car purchase in itself.

The change to BEVs and to self-driving cars will be much more disruptive
than anticipated.
