"[Pre-Suasion: A Revolutionary Way to Influence and Persuade](https://www.amazon.de/Pre-Suasion-Revolutionary-Way-Influence-Persuade-ebook/dp/B01A6DJD7Q)",
Robert Cialdini, (english language, EUR 12.99)

[Robert Cialdini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cialdini) is a
professor emeritus of Psychology and Marketing at the Arizona State
University, a visiting professor of marketing, business and psychology at
Stanford University, and is the author of several books on the psychology of
Influencing and Persuasion. This book is about getting someones attention,
and using it.

Cialdini speaks about privileged moments, points in time where we have
someones attention, and that person is also primed to actually follow our
reasoning along with our message. It goes on to analyse what makes these
moments privileged, and how we can help manufacturing them.

Being a funny and refreshing writer, Cialdini fills his stories with jokes
and anecdotes illustrating the point he's about to make. He's also liberally
using whatever he's explaining right now in convincing us that this
particular thing actually works, which is kind of a meta-demonstration of
the point he's making.

This book can help you trying to sell a thing or an idea better, to
customers, colleagues or other people that you need to get to listen. It's
also helping you to understand what's influencing you, and how, and giving
you tools to notice (and allow or deny) this. Going full meta, Cialdini
explains how that changes the process of persuasion, and gives studies and
examples to back even this up.

The book itself is not only full of stories and games playing with the
methods and the language of persuasion, it also contains a lot of footnotes
and pointers to followup reading, in case you want to go deeper. Time and
money well spent.
