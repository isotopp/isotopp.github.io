Two articles about the Maya civilization: 
[Seeker article](http://www.seeker.com/ancient-mayan-superhighways-found-in-the-guatemala-jungle-2219303581.html)
about LiDAR being used to reveal ancient structures on the Jungle ground: A
network of 150km of prehistoric Autobahn ran through the Jungle, binding the
Mayan Empire together.

> "These causeways are 130 feet wide, up to 20 feet high and in some cases
> they extend as far as 25 miles," Hansen said.

A causeway is a raised road across difficult, often wet or unstable ground.
Because of the raised structure LiDAR can find these roads even
today.

And from [PNAS](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/01/17/1618022114),
another article about radiocarbon dating of several Maya sites, illuminating
the time and speed of two collapses of the Maya civilization.

> Through this chronology, we traced the trajectories of the Preclassic
> collapse around AD 150–300 and the Classic collapse around AD 800–950,
> revealing similar patterns in the two cases. Social instability started
> with the intensification of warfare around 75 BC and AD 735, respectively,
> followed by the fall of multiple centers across the Maya lowlands around
> AD 150 and 810. The population of Ceibal persisted for some time in both
> cases, but the center eventually experienced major decline around AD 300
> and 900.
