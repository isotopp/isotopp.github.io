Lori Clary is a software engineer and silicon valley geek,
programming embedded systems and robot arms at General Dexterity
for a living. She's living the silicon valley lifestyle -
basically coding all day, collapsing in her hole of a
non-appartment, and not having contact with real people at all.
With one exception: She's ordering dinner from a delivery
service that is run by two mysterious brothers, who make a mean
spicy soup and crusty bread. The brothers have to leave, due to
visa issues, but they leave her with the sourdough culture.

She's learning to feed it, and to bake it, and soon she does not
know what do with all the bread. Turns out people love her
bread, and she needs to mass-produce it. Good thing that she's
working for a robot arm factory… 

Soon she's joining a geeky underground farmers market with a
techno-gothic flair. Robin Sloan is the author of "Mr Penumbra's
24-hour bookstore", und Sloan manages to keep the writing style
and the "Silcon Valley Geeks meet the real world" feel,
transplanting it successfully into a new story.
