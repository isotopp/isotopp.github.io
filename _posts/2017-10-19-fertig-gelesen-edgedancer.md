[Edgedancer](https://www.amazon.de/Edgedancer-Stormlight-Archive-Brandon-Sanderson/dp/1250166543)


Right now, one month before we get Oathbringer, the third part
of 
[The Stormlight Archive](https://coppermind.net/wiki/The_Stormlight_Archive), 
we get Edgedancer. This is a Novella that previously was part of
[Arcanum Unbounded](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Arcanum_Unbounded), 
a collection of short stories playing in the
[Cosmere](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Cosmere). As a standalone
Novella is has been expanded and is now 40k words long.

Edgedancer picks up the story of
[Lift](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Lift), a scrappy Reshi thief
that happens to bond with a Spren to follow the path of the
Edgedancer. Because Lift also had contact with the Nightwatcher,
she has interesting additional capabilities, among them to touch
Spren and to turn food into Stormlight.

Lift is a vagabond and has no desire to attach herself to
anybody or anything, she sees connection as a liability. This is
aligned with the Agent-of-Change aspect of the Edgedancer path,
but in conflict with the caring and healing aspects of the
Edgedancer, and the story explores that in the casual way that
is typical for Sandersons storytelling. Lift gets into a
conflict with [Nale](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Nale), the
damaged Herald of Justice, and manages to bring this story arc
to conclusion as well.
