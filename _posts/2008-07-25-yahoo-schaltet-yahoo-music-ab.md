heißt es:

> The bad dream of DRM continues. Yahoo e-mailed its Yahoo! Music Store
> customers yesterday, telling them it will be closing for good—and the
> company will take its DRM license key servers offline on September 30,
> 2008…
>
> Once the Yahoo store goes down and the key servers go offline, existing
> tracks cannot be authorized to play on new computers. Instead, Yahoo
> recommends the old, lame, and lossy workaround of burning the files to CD,
> then reripping them onto the computer. 
>
> Sure, you'll lose a bunch of blank CDs, sound quality, and all the
> metadata, but that's a small price to pay for the privilege of being able
> to listen to that music you lawfully acquired.
>
> Good thing you didn't download it illegally or just buy it on CD!
