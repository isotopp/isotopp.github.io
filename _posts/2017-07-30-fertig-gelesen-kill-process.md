[Kill Process](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B01HANZUI6/) is set in
the same universe as "Avogadro Corp:, but is a freestanding
story and not part of the Avogadro Series.

We meet Angelina Benenati. She's a self taught hacker and
database architect for Tomo, which is as much not Facebook as
Avogadro Corporation is not Google and Braeburn is not Apple in
Hertlings stories. She has a shady past, in which she hacked
systems under the name of "Angel of Mercy". She came out of an
abusive relationship by the way of stealthily murdering her
husband by the way of hacking the car's computer, and she lost
an arm in the resulting accident.

Angelina suffers from PTSD because of that, and she's also on a
crusade to use her unlimited database access at Tomo to identify
women in abusive relationships and dextering their husbands
through hacking to free them. Until she realizes that Tomo
itself somehow has a quite abuse relationship with its users,
and she sets out to change that.

She does this by inventing something that is completely not
Octodon, and putting it into a startup. Which kind of forces her
to stop her dextering, to confront her issues and start healing,
and to actually create instead of destroying. Until somebody
sets out to stalk her and tries to kill her.

Well written thriller with believable tech, solid Opsec advice,
and generally a book so much better discussing "social networks"
than "Eggers' The Circle" that it's off scale. Strongly recommended.
