[Imaginary Worlds Ep 114: The Man Behind the Sword](https://www.imaginaryworldspodcast.org/episodes/the-man-behind-the-sword) ([Episode Transcript PDF](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f9f06c44dd1ed19b7080797/t/5faf52831c7089551ae9c739/1605325444029/The+Man+Behind+the+Sword+transcript.pdf)) discussed Robert E. Howard, his 1930's character Conan, The Barbarian and how Howard's Conan is different from the Schwarzenegger character, and a much deeper and more complicated story. Go, and listen to the episode, it is well worth the time.

Having seen the Schwarzenegger film, but never actually having read the book I went out and got this complete collection. The podcast was right, the original book Conan is much unlike the Schwarzenegger film Conan, and the book is fun to read. It's a classic.
