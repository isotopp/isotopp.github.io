A long time ago, I wrote a text on the German Blog and on Carta: 
[Wieso wir uns veröffentlichen](http://www.carta.info/41830/wieso-wir-uns-veroffentlichen/)
(Why we publish ourselves).

In the middle of a discussion about privacy I was explaining why people
publish themselves, why they publicly reveal (sometimes intimate) facts
about themselves. They are doing this, I wrote, to find other like-minded
people, to become searchable and to become approachable, to build trust.
Trust is a wonderful thing. It is the powerful assumption that most people
most of the time want to help you and that falsely trying out to trust
people is a recoverable mistake. Having trust and being in a trustworthy
environment keeps transactional costs low and makes cooperation possible.

And that's rewarding and awesome. How does this work in practice?


So tomorrow there is [Pro Light and Sound in Frankfurt](http://www.messefrankfurt.com/frankfurt/en/besucher/welcome/messeveranstaltungen/messen/entertainment-media-creation/prolight_sound2017.html?nc).
Sammy wants to go there, and gets the combination ticket. That's admission
to the trade show, plus a ticket for German rail. That ticket is being
delivered as a Bahn Tix code, which you can 
[punch into any German ticket machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypxepZLxff8) 
and get a printout. We are in the Netherlands. The next ticket machine is in
Venlo. The route she's going to use does not pass Venlo. There is
[no way to get Bahn Tix online](http://praxistipps.chip.de/bahntix-online-ausdrucken-geht-das_44999).

I am asking on Google plus for help, and because I know at least one person
following me is a Train Driver I mention them into the thread. Sammy, me and
that person get into a Hangout. Ticket is being picked up and given the
train driver of ICE 220 FFM -\> Amsterdam Centraal. Shift change at the
border, ticket travels on to Amsterdam, +30 platform change 7b -\> 2.
Printed Ticket is being successfully delivered from the engine to Sammy at
11:58.

This is a direct application of 
[Interpersonal Ties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_ties) 
theory (pointing to article by
[Granovetter](https://sociology.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/the_strength_of_weak_ties_and_exch_w-gans.pdf)
(1973) and in a way to the works of 
[Peter Turchin](https://www.amazon.de/Ultrasociety-Years-Humans-Greatest-Cooperators/dp/0996139516).
High trust societies are societies where people have 
[many weak ties](http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/weak_ties.htm), 
that can be strengthened as demand arises. It's these strong weak ties that
enable (inter-) action and where cooperation wins between people are
highest. In order to have strong weak ties, a society needs to have a
relatively low and controlled wealth difference 
([Gini coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient)) and a 
working judicial system and low corruption. This creates social cohesion,
and enables "random" cooperation. 

Also, you win friends. Looking forward to a visit, soon.
