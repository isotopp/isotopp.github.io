[Evaluating the Changing Causes of Photovoltaics Cost Reduction](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2891516)

Why is PV Solar Energy getting cheaper and cheaper?

> We find that increased module efficiency was the leading low-level cause
> of cost reduction in 1980-2001, contributing almost 30% of the cost
> decline. The most important high-level mechanism was R&D in these earlier
> stages of the technology. After 2001, scale economies became a more
> significant cause of cost reduction, approaching R&D in importance.
> Policies that stimulate market growth have played a key role in enabling
> the cost reduction in PV, through privately-funded R&D and economies of
> scale, and to a lesser extent learning-by-doing
