[Netzpolitik.org has an article](https://netzpolitik.org/2017/interview-ueber-adblocker-und-das-wohlergehen-der-schadsoftware-branche-das-problem-malvertising-nicht-aussitzen/)
(in German) in which they are interviewing IT-Security Consultant Thorsten
Schröder on Adblockers, wasted capped mobile bandwidth and Malvertising.

»netzpolitik.org: Besides the protection against malware, what other reasons
for using Adblockers are important to you? 

Thorsten Schröder: If we classify things as malware which spy on users,
deceive them, compromise them or harm them financially, we have in principle
covered all reasons. Users you have the right to determine the level of
protection their computers need. Did our administration ask their Bundesamt
für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI)? It would be a good
opportunity for the BSI to show what they can do.«

The article goes on to discuss numbers and percentages. That is actually not
helpful. The numbers stated are by construction too low, and that can not be
helped. Also, the numbers are ultimately irrelevant, because Malvertisements
are not distributed randomly and evenly. The point being that Ad-Networks
generate their value not only from the raw number of eyeballs reached, but
quite a lot comes from being able to reach the right kind of eyeballs. The
better the Ad-Network, the better their targetting. 10.000 drive-by
impressions are worth quite a lot more when I can make sure that all 10.000
of them hit explotable XP/MSIE 6 combos, even if the relative number of
installations left in world with these characteristics is quite low.

And 10.000 impressions for ads containing this or that scam are worth a lot
more, when I can select an audience for these 10.000 expressions that is
badly educated, old or otherwise wrangling to stay on top of this Internet
thing and thus more likely to fall for it.

Targeted advertising and Malware Distribution are a match made in hell, they
amplify each other synergetically. This is an effect we need to push more to
the front of this discussion. Content Sites are responsible for the ads
integrated into their content and shown "as their own". Ad Networks are
responsible for the way the selectors they offer are being used. 

The German construct of Störerhaftung works in all directions, not just
against private Wifi offerings.
