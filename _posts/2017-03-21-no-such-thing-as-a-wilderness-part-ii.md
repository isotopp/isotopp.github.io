Similar effects are being discussed in 
[The Science Show of January 21](http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/scienceshow/effects-of-the-changing-climate-in-south-western-australia/8175170),
about current day South Western Australia:

> Cleared land produces less turbulence as storms move across the landscape.
> And fewer big trees means less transpiration. The atmosphere is drier, the

> The water table is falling by half a metre a year. If the trend continues,
> there are predictions of a 17% drop in agricultural production in future
> decades.
