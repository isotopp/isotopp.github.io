Paul Fischer writes "[A Kim Jong-Il Production](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00OMH54L2)", a documentary the 1978 abduction of the famous South Korean actress Madam Choi, and her ex-husband, the filmmaker Shin Sang-Ok.

Before becoming the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-Il headed the Ministry for Propaganda.
Dissatisfied with the talent available, he had the famous actress Choi Eun-Hee kidnammed.
When her ex-husband started to investigate, he had him kidnapped in Hong Kong and transported to North Korea by ship.

Together, they made [seven films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abduction_of_Shin_Sang-ok_and_Choi_Eun-hee#Films) for Kim Jong-Il, gaining his trust.
During a research trip in Vienna they fled to the US embassy.

The book uses [this true story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abduction_of_Shin_Sang-ok_and_Choi_Eun-hee) to shed a light on life in North Korea, and to explain how it became the hermetically sealed country it is today.

The seventh film of Choi and Shin, [Pulgasari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCKSR0JArUQ), can be found on Youtube with english subtitles. It is a Godzilla-like monster tale, in which a rice toy of a blacksmiths daugther comes to life and turns into a giant metal-eating monster fighting for the rights of poor farmers in feudal Korea. When the monster eventually turns aganst the farmers, the blacksmiths daugther sacrifices herself killing the monster.
