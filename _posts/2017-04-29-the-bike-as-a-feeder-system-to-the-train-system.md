the train themselves are a viable transport alternative, but how they
together are much more than the sum of their parts:

Biking increases the catchment area of train stations, allowing
an increase of the distance between stops for stop-trains, and consequently
also for all higher-order trains. This speeds up the train system, making it
a lot more attractive and a lot more viable. Both bike-use and train-use
increase, making the high-density urban environment more liveable and
attractive as well.
