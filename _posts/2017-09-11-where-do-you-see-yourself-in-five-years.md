### Seriously, HR people ask the weirdest questions.

> "Where do you see yourself in five years?"

For a Twentysomething with no owned property and no family the
truthful answer is of course "In a different company, twice
removed. Not because you suck more than anywhere else, but,
like, statistically."

"Where do you see yourself in five years?" "Week 27 or 28?" --

That time when you finish school and university and before you
settle down with dependencies that make you immobile - it is an
important time in your life. Use it wisely: Change jobs every
two to three years, and make it count.

That is: understand that the people you work with are more
important than the companies you work for - you are building
your professional network. The companies you work for will
change every few years, but the network you build will be with
you for the rest of your life. It will be an important part of
you and your career.

These people you are with in your wild years, they are the
people who will recommend you to the company you are aiming for
next. They will make sure that your CV is at least read, if you
send it there. They will make sure that you have at least the
first interview with that new shop. They are the people who will
ask you, when they have a professional question regarding your
area of expertise, and who will listen to your recommendations -
for hiring, for purchase, or just for grounding some goofball
ideas which may or may not turn into a startup.

### Seriously, HR people have the weirdest ideas.

I met some once, who were wondering why self-assessment and 360º
reviews and management reviews diverge so much. There are things
like
[this](https://www.impraise.com/team-performance-analytics/) for
[example](https://www.impraise.com/feedback-behaviour-report/)
(and that's already one of the better solutions).
But you are effectively typing feedback about your future
network peers into a SaaS solution, and you know that. 

So there is a third party company which collects data about me
at work, and what others think about me. This company may or may
not keep it around when we leave our current engagement,
depending on legislation, this companies operational skills and
culture: 

Would you trust a company with an Uber-like culture with this data?

How do you know if they are an Uber or not? If they keep it, and
they are successful in their market, they will build a profile
over my networks and my entire career, over each of our
professional engagements over time. Yeah, one more profile to
worry about, on top of the Google shadow, the Github and the
Linkedin.

Anyway, back when I was 20 (that was 1988), I learned the value
of feedback - it is what helps you grow. 

_I also learned that negative feedback is always delivered over
coffee and beer, privately, face to face, and never, ever,
written down._

Especially not in some random 3rd parties SaaS interface.
You have no idea where it is going to end up, how long it is
being kept or who is going to buy whom in the end. So, anything
that goes into reports and reviews will of course be formatted
in a way such that it does not damage the current and future
relationship between my network and me. It's not real and can't
ever be.

And that was true already before systems like these, when HR was
still working with paper folders and kept data in-house.

### Seriously, HR people have the weirdest jobs.

Whatever technology you build, theirs can't be automated, and in
many ways not even effectively assisted.
