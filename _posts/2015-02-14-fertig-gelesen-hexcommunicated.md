Turns out people go insane by the way of identity loss if you provide remove too much of their own body in the process of giving them milspec cyber enhancements. Turns out that's fixable by giving them a good backstory and themed identity. At least that is the premise that Chandler uses to excuse his merciless verbal sadism that brings us Nosferodents, Vampoules, Fearwolves, Frankenstitches and other Force Amplified Entities (FAE) of the Hermetic Extroy Division (Hex Divison). We are spared nothing.

Clearly, the setting and the premise of the story was conceived in a very late night drunken Shadowrun Roleplaying session. The execution, though, is a flawless and gripping thriller, a furious and blood drenched ride along the well tested trope of the classical theme of "rogue-team gone underground must save the world against all odds and without the ressources of their actual agency".

The book is too short, and it cries for a sequel. Buy it under all circumstances, even if only to encourage Rafael Chandler to write more. Because he's good.
