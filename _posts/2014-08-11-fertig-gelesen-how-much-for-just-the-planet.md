>The door opened again, and Ship’s Surgeon Leonard McCoy came in. Without a word to anyone, he walked crookedly to the wall, leaned heavily against it, and said something that sounded like “Plergb hfarizz ungemby, and coffee.” Bones McCoy was not a morning person.

> Pleep, the wall replied, and then pling for the delivery of Scott’s breakfast, and pling again for Spock’s. They sat down at the table with Kirk.
>
> The captain had broken the yolk on one of his eggs, buttered his toast, and had his glass two-thirds of the way to his mouth before noticing that the liquid in the tumbler was blue.
>
> Not the deep indigo of grape juice, or the soothing azure of Romulan ale, but a luminous, electric blue, a color impossible in nature.
>
> Kirk looked around the table. Scott and Spock were discussing some obscure engineering aspect of the bal—Deployable Practice Target. There didn’t seem to be anything wrong with their breakfasts; Scott’s black coffee was black, Spock’s juice was pale gold. Dr. McCoy was still waiting for his meal, watching the rest of them like a vulture with a hangover, but his stare had a distinctly unfocused quality. Maybe it was just the early hour, Kirk thought, a trick of the light or something. He looked at his juice again. Still blue.
>
> Starship captains are a special breed of beings who boldly go, et cetera. Kirk took a sip of the blue liquid. It tasted just like orange juice. It even had pulp that got caught in his teeth, just like orange juice.
>
> One more look. Blue.
>
> The wall plinged, and McCoy brought his tray to the table. Kirk looked at the doctor’s meal: there was a huge mug of coffee, a slab of Virginia ham, and an enormous heap of something else. The something else was orange, in the same way Kirk’s juice had not been orange: it was signal-flare orange, bright as a Christmas necktie. Kirk noticed that Spock and Scotty had stopped talking, and eating, and were looking intently at the orange mound on the doctor’s plate.
>
> Oblivious, McCoy buttered the orange heap, sliced the ham, and went at them like a starving man.
>
> After a moment, Spock finished his crackers and cheese, stood up, and slipped his tray into the disposal slot. “Excuse me, Captain, Mr. Scott, Dr. McCoy. I have some preparations to make for the Target tests.”
>
> “Aye,” Scott said, watching McCoy eat as the syrup congealed around his own oatcakes. Kirk said “Of course, Spock.” McCoy said “Gmltfrbl.”
