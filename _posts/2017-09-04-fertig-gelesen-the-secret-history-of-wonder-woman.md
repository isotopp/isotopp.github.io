One of the weirdest and most interesting characters in the DC
Universe is Wonder Woman, because she is full of seemingly
irreconcilable contradictions. 
Created by a man, [William Moulton Marston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Moulton_Marston),
in 1941, her history is actually deeply rooted in the
[Suffragette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffragette)
movement of the early 20th century. Marston owes much of the
ideas and the origin myth to earlier stories from that era and
cosmos, through his wifes Elizabeth Holloway Marston and Olive
Byrne, and through Olives Byrne's connection with Ethel Byrne
and [Margaret Sanger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Sanger).

The book is a biography of Marston, but really is a history of
feminism in the United States, and also making a case that there
are [no waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waves_of_feminism),
but one large, meandering river. A much recommended, very
unexpected find, and an eye-opening view on a bunch of unique
characters, both real and imagined.
