Let's see. 
[Volt in SI units](https://www.google.nl/webhp#q=volt+in+si+units):

That gives us 
$$
1V = 1 kg * m^2 * s^{-3} * A^{-1}.
$$

We can turn the kg into pounds and the square meters into square feet, but
we can't easily imperialize the seconds and Amperes. That leaves us with

That's 2613 freedom volts (or George Bushes) to the 110 SI volts.

And it can be done with Google Math queries only, which is somewhat
impressive.
