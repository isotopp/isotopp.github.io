[Here](https://pepijnvloemans.wordpress.com/2017/07/08/charging-infrastructure/amp/) is the question: 

> How much infrastructure do we need when ALL 8 million vehicles
> (and buses and trucks!) in the Netherlands go electric? The
> answer will surprise you: we could get to 100% electric
> transportation in the Netherlands, just by converting the 4000
> existing gast stations to fast charging stations which have an
> average of 14 fast chargers.

article then plays with numbers a bit: Kilometers driven,
electricity used, number of chargepoints, charging rates.

(for germans: The Netherlands compare in area and population
pretty well to Nordrhein-Westfalen)
