Commodore 64, [Evan-Amos @ Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64#/media/File:Commodore-64-Computer.jpg)

As Moore's Law shows signs of coming to an end, 
[the Guardian has an article about the history of computing](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/26/vanishing-point-rise-invisible-computer)
from the Intel 4004 to current tech, and how with the Internet of Shit and
Chips and Networking in everything, all of our computers are becoming just
one computer.

> Everyone knows that modern computers are better than old ones. But it is
> hard to convey just how much better, for no other consumer technology has
> improved at anything approaching a similar pace. The standard analogy is
> with cars: if the car from 1971 had improved at the same rate as computer
> chips, then by 2015 new models would have had top speeds of about 420
> million miles per hour.
