Ads on the web have many problems:

- Ad selection criteria have been abused for dissemination of propaganda,
for targeted malware attacks. 
- Content sites have basically lost the control over what kind of stuff they
deliver through the ad-space on their site.
- Tracking is increasingly a concern for users. 
- Ads bloat sites, slow down page display times and mess with peoples mobile
data plans.
- Ads use power and create heat in devices with a tight power budgets
(basically, anything that runs on a battery and has no fans, phones,
tablets, laptops).
- Ads play unwanted video and audio, open layers and windows, popovers and
popunders.
- Ads destroy usability and layout on content sites.

The market is collapsing: basically nobody is running a browser without an
adblocker any more, and those that don't adblock in their minds -
clickthrough rates are nonexistent. So when everything is on fire, is there
a unified group of stakeholders - content sites, browser makers, ad-industry
leaders - at work to make things "better" or at least fix their broken
non-business? 

Well, no. [Says Marketingland](https://marketingland.com/industry-groups-self-regulatory-program-coalition-for-better-ads-226109)
in their article,
[ANA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_National_Advertisers),
[4As](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Association_of_Advertising_Agencies)
and [IAB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Advertising_Bureau) want
to talk to [CAB](https://www.betterads.org/) about their Better Ads program,
but request being exempt from Chrome's coming integral Adblock feature in
exchange.

Now, Mozilla and Safari are not part of CAB, and have little interest in
joining, and also put a different focus on how to handle things: Safari
tries to address tracking with their new 
[Tracking Prevention](https://marketingland.com/apple-safari-intelligent-ad-tracking-what-we-know-216865),
and it's
[good enough to be widely hated](https://martechtoday.com/digital-advertising-industry-responds-apple-intelligent-tracking-prevention-204141).
Other initiatives such as [DNT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track)
were a failure - not because of a lack of interest on the user side, but
because advertisers and sites were boycotting it. 

Google SVP of Ads and
Commerce Sridhar Ramaswamy said, “Our hope is once this is in place, there’s
no need for ad blocking on mobile.” On the other hand, things like [
Brainy Ape Apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.puzzlingapps.spelling.nl.free)
play uninterruptible video ads for Free-To-Play ("Pay To Win") apps with
install buttons in the middle of educational games targeted age 4-10.
Ramaswamy clearly is a very optimistic person. And as long as the
Advertisers and their channels do not realize the depth of the shit they are
in it still has to get worse before it can become better.
