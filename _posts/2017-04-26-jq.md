When dealing with Kubernetes, you will inevitably have to deal with config
and data that is in JSON format. [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq) is a
cool tool to handle this, but while the man page is complete, it is also
very dry. A 
[nice tutorial](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/json-and-jq) can be found
at The Programming Historian, which uses some real world use cases. My
personal use case is 
[Converting JSON to CSV](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32960857/how-to-convert-arbirtrary-simple-json-to-csv-using-jq),
and the 
[inverse of that](https://github.com/stedolan/jq/wiki/Cookbook#convert-a-csv-file-with-headers-to-json).
There also is a mildly interesting
[FAQ](https://github.com/stedolan/jq/wiki/FAQ). Learning jq takes about one
quiet afternoon of time.
