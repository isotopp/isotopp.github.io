<p>A talk by Marco te Brömmelstroet and others about how neither the Bike nor the train themselves are a viable transport alternative, but how they together are much more than the sum of their parts: [caption id="attachment\_1613" align="aligncenter" width="635"][![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bildschirmfoto-2017-04-29-um-11.30.40.png)](http://cyclingacademics.blogspot.nl/2015/03/nine-arguments-for-seeing-bicycle-train.html) [Nine Arguments for seeing bicycle-train as one mobility system](http://cyclingacademics.blogspot.nl/2015/03/nine-arguments-for-seeing-bicycle-train.html)[/caption] <!--more-->Biking increases the catchment area of train stations, allowing an increase of the distance between stops for stop-trains, and consequently also for all higher-order trains. This speeds up the train system, making it a lot more attractive and a lot more viable. Both bike-use and train-use increase, making the high-density urban environment more liveable and attractive as well.
