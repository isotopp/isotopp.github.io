<p>> Work Chat said: [On boiling water with Gas instead of an electric cooker] L\> Yeah, they have 110 freedom volts. Or whatever weird unit they use for that. I\> So what is the imperial unit for Volt?</p>
<p> Let's see. [Volt in SI units](https://www.google.nl/webhp#q=volt+in+si+units):<!--more-->[![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-10-at-15.38.39.png)](https://www.google.nl/webhp#q=volt+in+si+units) That gives us 1V = 1 **kg**  **m^2** s^-3 A^-1. We can turn the kg into pounds and the square meters into square feet, but we can't easily imperialize the seconds and Amperes. That leaves us with [![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-10-at-15.41.49.png)](https://www.google.nl/search#q=1+pound+(sq+ft)+(s^-3)+(A^-1)+in+volt) That's 2613 freedom volts (or Goerge Bushes) to the 110 SI volts.
