    <a href="#fortigate-and-ivanti">
	Fortigate and Ivanti
    </a>
</h1>
<p>First off, <strong>today</strong> was Fortigate patch day:</p>
<p><p class="md__image">
  <img src="/uploads/2024/02/schlangenoel-01.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>

</p>
<p><em>CVE-2024-23113, CVSSV3 Score 9.8, Unauthorized Code Execution, &ldquo;Format String Bug&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;A use of <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/134.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">externally-controlled format string</a>

 vulnerability
in FortiOS <code>fgfmd</code> daemon may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code or
commands via specially crafted requests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is a case where a C function accepts a format string like <code>&quot;Blah %s Nonsense&quot;</code>,
to assemble a log message or a command for a <code>system()</code> call.
However, the developer did not statically set the format parameter of the command to a format string
(<code>snprintf(buffer, length, &quot;Blah %s Nonsense&quot;, user_input)</code>),
but instead took the user input as the format
(<code>snprintf(buffer, length, user_input))</code>.
The user input can thus be used to do all sorts of things.</p>
<p>This is a mistake automatically detected by the usual source code scanners.
If you try to commit or merge something like this in a modern development environment,
the scanner will thoroughly humiliate you,
the commit will be rejected, and you will be assigned a security training.</p>
<p>This means this type of error does not occur in a contemporary development environment anymore.</p>
<p>Also, <strong>yesterday</strong> was Fortigate patch day:</p>
<p><p class="md__image">
  <img src="/uploads/2024/02/schlangenoel-02.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>

</p>
<p><em>CVE-2024-21762, CVSSV3 Score 9.6, Unauthorized Code Execution, &ldquo;Out of Bounds Write&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;A <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">out-of-bounds write</a>

 vulnerability
in FortiOS may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code or command via specially crafted HTTP requests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is a mistake easily made in C or other languages without index checking when accessing arrays.
In C, for example, one can access memory before the array using negative indices,
and if an error code is -1, but the error code is not checked after a function call, then everything goes up in flames.</p>
<p>This type of error is not always found by source code scanners with a static analyzer,
but most cases should be flagged by the scanner as a code smell.</p>
<p>Well, unfortunately, <strong>the day before yesterday</strong> was also a Fortigate patch day.
<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fortinet-warns-of-new-fortisiem-rce-bugs-in-confusing-disclosure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BleepingComputer reports</a>

:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this instance, due to an issue with the API which we are currently investigating,
rather than an edit, this resulted in two new CVEs being created, duplicates of the original CVE-2023-34992,
FortiNet told BleepingComputer.</p>
<p>However, it turns out that CVE-2024-23108 and CVE-2024-23109 are actually patch bypasses for the CVE-2023-34992
flaw discovered by Horizon3 vulnerability expert Zach Hanley.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, this was a patch for a patch because the mitigation didn&rsquo;t work,
and Fortinet got confused with the CVE numbers due to the sheer volume of them currently open.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the US CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency)
is demanding all US institutions to shut down Ivanti VPN (formerly Juniper Pulse Secure):</p>
<p><p class="md__image">
  <img src="/uploads/2024/02/schlangenoel-03.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>

</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;CISA is requiring all Federal agencies to disconnect Ivanti products by Friday at midnight
(Ivanti Connect Secure &amp; Ivanti Policy Secure).
This is roughly 48-hours notice, to not patch, but rip it out!
Ivanti is an American company.
This is unprecedented.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>While the
<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/supplemental-direction-v1-ed-24-01-mitigate-ivanti-connect-secure-and-ivanti-policy-secure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original directive</a>


could initially be interpreted as an update, re-installation, and reconfiguration, this hope has now been dashed.</p>
<p>The patches mentioned are not suitable for fixing the error.
<a href="https://infosec.exchange/@briankrebs/111863433959430768" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian Krebs has summarized this issue</a>

:</p>
<p>Meanwhile, someone opened up the Ivanti image and took a look inside.</p>
<p><p class="md__image">
  <img src="/uploads/2024/02/schlangenoel-04.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>

</p>
<p><em>Versions of software that have been routinely outdated for more than a decade in the current image.</em></p>
<p>As curl developer Stefan Eissing phrases it, these are &ldquo;corpse parts and zombie software.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, as expected, a few days after the CISA-mandated patch frenzy,
<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ivanti-patch-new-connect-secure-auth-bypass-bug-immediately/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BleepingComputer headlines again</a>

:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ivanti: Patch new Connect Secure auth bypass bug immediately</strong></p>
<p>The flaw (CVE-2024-22024) is due to an XXE
(<a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XML eXternal Entities</a>

) weakness in the gateways&rsquo; SAML component
that lets remote attackers gain access to restricted resources on unpatched appliances in low-complexity
attacks without requiring user interaction or authentication.</p></blockquote>
<p>SAML, Security Assertion Markup Language, is an XML notation for access rights in Single Sign-On systems.
Because it&rsquo;s an XML notation, it can have these <code>&amp;blablub;</code> things – Entities – that are replaced by other text.
With External Entities, the replacement text is not locally fixed but is downloaded from the net.</p>
<p>What does this mean in the context of SAML?
It means that the access rights in the document are not necessarily fixed;
an attacker can load Entity definitions from the net.
Depending on where the Entity is used, it can partially or completely rewrite the SAML file and grant different rights.</p>
<p>XML parsers are well understood,
and XXE is something that can be reliably scanned for automatically with a source code scanner.
This type of error is easily avoidable in modern development environments.</p>

	Antivirus and Endpoint Security
    </a>
</h1>
<p>This is not an exception and is not limited to VPN gateways,
but rather manufacturers of security software happily rely on
&ldquo;security-relevant software with privileges, and programming methods from the 90s of the last millennium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Examples from this blog:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/2017/10/20/aslr.html">ASLR</a>

: macOS Trend Micro Binary without ASLR, every exploit (yes, there are some)
automatically stable across the entire fleet.</li>
<li><a href="/2018/06/18/websense-dlp-gives-instant-root.html">Websense DLP gives instant root</a>

:
WebSense DLP ships outdated software versions and an exploitable kernel module, probably missing QA and defective shipping process.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is so widespread in endpoint security that, for example,
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@joxean" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@joxean</a>


has written an entire book about it:
<a href="https://www.amazon.de/Antivirus-Hackers-Handbook-English-ebook/dp/B014MJ6AKS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Antivirus Hacker&rsquo;s Handbook</a>

.
It describes how to find vulnerabilities of this kind in every – literally every – AV software.</p>
<p>This is systematic: It is due to the way this software is designed and developed, and it cannot be fixed with patches.</p>
<p>I know this because I played this game for a few years with a company Mac:
I used the so-called &ldquo;security tools&rdquo; that Corp installed on my Mac to gain privileges on my Mac.</p>
<p>The whole process is reliably repeatable, and I never had to invest more than a slow Friday afternoon in any case.
And I am not even a &ldquo;security researcher,&rdquo; just an amateur with reverse engineering experience from the C64 era.</p>
<p>It is this software, which is supposed to protect, ending up making the computer vulnerable.
When someone like Fefe talks about <a href="https://blog.fefe.de/?q=Schlangen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snake oil</a>

, it is to be taken literally.</p>
<p><p class="md__image">
  <img src="/uploads/2024/02/schlangenoel-05.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>

</p>
<p><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_oil" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snake-Oil</a>

 is a term used to describe deceptive marketing,
health care fraud, or a scam.
Similarly, snake oil salesman is a common label used to describe someone who sells, promotes,
or is a general proponent of some valueless or fraudulent cure, remedy, or solution.</em></p>

    <a href="#a-list-of-problems-and-outdated-processes">
	A List of Problems and Outdated Processes
    </a>
</h1>
<p>We are talking about critically security-relevant software here,
which is supposed to prevent the intrusion of malware and attackers on computers,
or is supposed to detect such attacks, or has authentication or some other form of security-relevant function.</p>
<p>It runs at critical points, often with privileges, and when it fails, it is not just one machine,
but often an entire company that is critically exposed.</p>
<p>Such software should be developed with tools and methods that are state-of-the-art
and undergo critical inspection with regard to correctness, freedom from errors, and currency of dependencies.</p>
<p>However, we see errors that suggest deficiencies in the development process at all points.</p>
<ul>
<li>We are seeing critical errors that would not have to have major problematic impact
if the software had been written with minimal rights from the outset.
But running parsers for complex, unknown data formats that may contain potentially malicious payloads with privileges?
And then turning off elementary security mechanisms such as ASLR?
That means setting up for maximum damage.
It is not a winnable position.</li>
<li>Doing all this in 2024 in C, when Go or Rust could have been used? Not particularly smart either.</li>
<li>Packing your deliverables with software that, in the case of Ivanti, has been without patches for up to two decades?
Correct would be to have an automated release process that assembles a new release from the latest versions of everything
and tests it automatically.
What Ivanti delivers is not just &ldquo;not state-of-the-art,&rdquo; it is grossly negligent.</li>
<li>Delivering all this in an encrypted image, instead of with a &ldquo;SBOM of Shame&rdquo;
is soon to be a federal crime in the USA, and the EU is on the same path. Good.
(An SBOM is a Software Bill Of Materials, a list of the dependencies used and their versions.)</li>
<li>A &ldquo;Format String Bug&rdquo; or an &ldquo;XML External Entities Vulnerability&rdquo; are trivial errors that source code scanners can detect.
Such source scanners are being advertised by these security firms themselves or even developed in-house.
But these tools are not in use internally, because otherwise, such code could never have made it into a product.
This does not require AI; in part, these are better regular expressions, sometimes a bit of static analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>As external observers, based on the demonstrated error patterns,
we are witnessing a failure along the entire software development chain:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the architecture level (not minimizing rights),</li>
<li>at the tool level (no scanners for trivial errors, outdated dependencies, no automation in build and release),</li>
<li>at the packaging level (the defective permissions in Websense, for example),</li>
<li>and at every other point where one can infer the process from the errors observed from the outside.
<ul>
<li>For example, &ldquo;no functioning code review and audit&rdquo;
(&ldquo;statically compiled-in backdoor passwords,&rdquo; as are a persistent problem at Cisco, fall under this).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are thus management errors in the leadership of software companies that produce security-critical software.
It is the responsibility of management to establish and control processes that ensure a minimum level of quality.</p>
<p>The notion &ldquo;software errors, nothing can be done about it&rdquo; is incorrect –
there are entire classes of errors that can be definitively avoided through architecture,
automatic scanning,
education,
review,
and testing.
It is the responsibility of management to establish and control such processes.</p>
<p>All in all, one can only conclude that irresponsible hack shops without fundamental software development processes
are masquerading as &ldquo;security&rdquo; companies.
They are packaging radioactive toxic waste in glossy packages,
thereby building a highway for nation-state actors into the heart of critical infrastructures.</p>
<p>In some cases, the nature of the error borders on deliberate sabotage, or,
to put it another way, it could hardly be worse with deliberate sabotage.</p>

    <a href="#1010-no-notes">
	10/10, no notes
    </a>
</h1>
<p>On IRC, my friends joke:
&ldquo;Are you a 10/10 company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Security vulnerabilities are not only assigned a unique number, the CVE number,
but they also receive a severity grade,
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerability_Scoring_System" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVSS-Score</a>

.
A 10/10 is the maximum grade, but basically, anything above 8 is considered
<a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a total loss and complete process failure</a>

.</p>
<p>There is now a historical CVE database that can be
<a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/cvssscoremin-9/cvssscoremax-10/vulnerabilities.html?page=1&amp;cvssscoremin=9&amp;cvssscoremax=10&amp;order=3&amp;trc=40515&amp;sha=2721cbf47ba1e57d8b65ae1c3cf8883295fd04d7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sorted by CVSS score</a>

,
and also narrowed down to companies like
<a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-3080/Fortinet.html?page=1&amp;cvssscoremin=9&amp;order=3&amp;trc=103&amp;sha=0ba96ce0b5ea0195196988ef1d381bdd33622c49" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fortinet</a>

.</p>
<p>We then see for Fortinet a series of 12 errors with a 10/10 rating,
specifically 2x in 2024, 1x in 2021, 1x in 2019, 3x in 2017, 4x in 2016, and once in 2005.
This can also be summarized as &ldquo;no improvement is observable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Security is a process,&rdquo; it is often said.
For Business Continuity Management, I once wrote down what that means:
<a href="/2023/02/18/this-is-not-a-drill.html">This is not a Drill. This is just Tuesday</a>

.</p>
<p>Similar considerations can be made for secure software development processes,
and there are even ready-made process blueprints available for this purpose.
Furthermore, as I have shown, the patterns of errors can reveal the weaknesses in the internal development process
with regard to security best practices.
The numbers of CVEs and CVSS scores can indicate whether a company has improved its posture.</p>
<p>If it is apparent that this has not been the case over the years, how can a purchasing decision be made positively?
Something to think about.</p>
