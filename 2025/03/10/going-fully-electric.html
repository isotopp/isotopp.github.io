				<p>End of April 2022, we got <a href="/2022/05/02/a-solar-roof.html">our solar roof</a>

.</p>
<p><p class="md__image">
  <img src="/uploads/2022/05/solar-03.png" alt=""  />
</p>

</p>
<p><em>Using gas, we are heating this house using 1100-1300 m^3 gas per year.
That&rsquo;s 11-13 MWh primary energy. At 156 qm, that is between 72 kWh/(qm * year) and
76 kWh/(qm * year).</em></p>
<p>In the Netherlands, this is good for an energielabel &ldquo;A&rdquo;,
in Germany 75 kWh/(qm * year) is the border between &ldquo;B&rdquo; and &ldquo;C&rdquo;.</p>
<h1 id="getting-rid-of-natural-gas-heating-and-cooling-the-top-floor">
    <a href="#getting-rid-of-natural-gas-heating-and-cooling-the-top-floor">
	Getting rid of natural gas heating and cooling the top floor
    </a>
</h1>
<p>Our objective for 2025 was to get rid of the gas heating,
and install electrical heating based on heat pumps.
Additionally, I needed cooling, because upstairs it can get rather warm in the summer.</p>
<p><p class="md__image">
  <img src="/uploads/2025/03/electric-1.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>

</p>
<p><em>In summer, the temperature upstairs won&rsquo;t fall below 24ºC, even at night.
During these times, I can&rsquo;t sleep upstairs anymore.
I would migrate to the first floor overnight, and suffer during the day.</em></p>
<p>After shopping around a bit, we decided to go for a set of Panasonic Multisplit Airconditioners (Air-Air Heatpumps):
Two multi-split outdoor units, and a total of seven indoor units.</p>
<p>A 5x outdoor unit would be positioned at the south wall, driving 4 indoor units,
and the 3x outdoor unit would be sitting at the north wall, driving 3 indoor units.</p>
<p>Warm water would be supplied by a heat pump boiler.</p>
<p><p class="md__image">
  <img src="/uploads/2025/03/electric-2.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>

</p>
<p><em>A Panasonic indoor unit, wall mounted under the roof of the room.</em></p>
<p>The indoor units get wall mounted on either the north or south wall of the house.
They require two insulated copper pipes for the refrigerant, a power cable and a plastic hose for condensate water
to the passed to the outside, through the wall.</p>
<p>For that, an 80 mm hole is being drilled into the wall to pass the connectors to the outside.
On the south side, we have been able to remove the wood paneling of the house,
and run these things over the outside insulation under the wood panels.
On the north side, the connections run to the wide of the house,
and are passed downstairs under the wood panels of the large windows.
They are then led to the outdoor unit on the ground.
Condensate is spilled directly to the ground (into the plants),
and power and refrigerant connections are led to the outdoor units.</p>
<p><p class="md__image">
  <img src="/uploads/2025/03/electric-3.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>

</p>
<p><em>This is what the wall mount and the hole look like, under the indoor units.</em></p>
<p>Running the plumbing and the wires under the wood hides all the ugly pipes quite well,
but required quite some effort with the house.</p>
<p><p class="md__image">
  <img src="/uploads/2025/03/electric-4.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>

</p>
<p><em>The 5x outdoor unit, already in place. No plumbing is connected, so far,
but the wood panels are already removed, ready to take the pipes.</em></p>
<h1 id="fixing-the-fuse-box">
    <a href="#fixing-the-fuse-box">
	Fixing the Fuse Box
    </a>
</h1>
<p>The air conditioners require single phase connections, and dedicated fuses, each.
Making this change would have overloaded our fuse box,
which was in a desolate state after 20 years of incremental changes anyway.
So an additional task of the installation process was a complete renewal of the fuse box,
including newly added differential breakers, more space and a general cleanup.
I also got some wall sockets in the fuse box, for the fiber connection and the fiber modem,
plus some spares.</p>
<p><p class="md__image">
  <img src="/uploads/2025/03/electric-5.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>

</p>
<p><em>The fuse box and electrical meter, after the cleanup.
There are still two additional Shelley meters that need to go in.</em></p>
<h1 id="warm-water">
    <a href="#warm-water">
	Warm Water
    </a>
</h1>
<p>The largest and most ugly part of the installation is the warm water boiler.
In the photo you see it before installation: a 200l tank with a heat pump on top.
For installation, it needs to be fixated, connected and requires two 160mm pipes to the roof
for air-in and air-out. These are not yet visible in the image.</p>
<p><p class="md__image">
  <img src="/uploads/2025/03/electric-6.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>

</p>
<p>Normally, you would install it in the place where the old gas boiler was.
Since we are keeping the gas boiler around for at least another 1-2 years as a backup,
that was not (yet) possible.</p>
<p>This device is also the loudest of all parts.
When running, it creates a 43 dBa noise level,
39 dBa in 1.5m distance.</p>
<p><p class="md__image">
  <img src="/uploads/2025/03/electric-7.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>

</p>
<p>We typically run it at 11:00 in the morning.
At that time, we have sufficient solar energy to drive the heat pump (500 W intake),
and the outside air is already warm, making it easier for the heat pump to do its work.</p>
<p>Warming up 200 kg of water from 15ºC to 50ºC takes around 8.13 kWh of energy,
and the heat pump is rated with a COP of slightly under 3 for 7ºC air-in temperature.
That means an initial &ldquo;heat-pump only&rdquo; run will take about 3 kWh of energy at 500 W power,
so warming up the entire thing will have an initial run-time of 6 hours.</p>
<p>Or you press the &ldquo;Boost&rdquo; button, which will enable an additional electrical heater inside,
adding another 1500 W of energy intake to speed things up.</p>
<p><p class="md__image">

</p>

</p>
<p><em>A teenage boy has showered late in the evening. The heat pump brings the water reservoir up to spec again.
This used 1.1 kWh (around 30 cent).
You can see how the heat pump uses more power to warm up the water the warmer the water in storage gets.
The difference from 40ºC to 50ºC is almost 100 Watt.</em></p>
<p>During a normal day, we have to replace the used water and warm it up,
that will take around 2 hours of time and circa 1.5 kWh of energy on a normal day.</p>

</h1>
<p>Also, an additional task in the installation process was to wall off the top floor from the staircase and the rest of the house.
We also wanted to make the airspace smaller above the staircase, and install some unheated storage space.</p>
<p>This will keep the cool air generated upstairs (where it is warmest in summer) upstairs,
and give us some much needed storage space for some things.</p>
<p><p class="md__image">

</p>
<p>Ten days into March, we are at 0 m^3 gas usage.
So we are natural-gas free.</p>
<p>We are using as much electrical energy as we produce, which is normal for early March.
Currently, we are coming out at net 13 kWh consumed for the first ten days.</p>
<p>Electricity usage is definitively up. A lot.</p>
<p><p class="md__image">
  <img src="/uploads/2025/03/electric-12.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>

</p>
<p><em>The first ten days of March, compared to the last 10 days of September, and air temperatures of early march.</em></p>
<p>We can see that the house baselined at around or below 10 kWh/day in September,
with the spikes being days where the car was being charged.</p>
<p>In March, the car was charged on March, 1st, for 15.34 kWh,
leading to a usage spike of 42.6 kWh and a grid draw of 32.9 kWh, for a total net draw of 23.63 kWh.
Doing the math leaves us with approximately 17 kWh electrical energy for heating,
at an assumed COP of 3 this yields 50-ish kWh of heat energy, or a gas equivalent of 5 m^3.
That is not too shabby for a day with freezing at night and around 8ºC during the day.</p>
<p>Energy used is roughly proportional to the outdoor temperature.
Especially the last three days have been warm and sunny,
so all indoor units but the one in the living room on the first floor have been off.</p>
<p>For the night of the 9th of March, things looked like this (compared to September):</p>
<p><p class="md__image">
  <img src="/uploads/2025/03/electric-13.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>

</p>
<p><em>Baseline usage in September was around 300 Watt. We are now at around 700-750 Watt with a single unit running.
This keeps the temperature stable in the living room, and kitchen.</em></p>
<p>The first floor is roughtly &ldquo;J&rdquo;-shaped:
The long side of the J is the living room, with a indoor unit at the top of the J, the south wall.
The bow of the J is the eating place, and the short side of the J is the kitchen.
The north wall, and the bow of the J, has a second indoor unit.</p>
<p>For this night, I kept the living room indoor unit running at 23ºC.
The north wall unit in the kitchen was kept off.
The kitchen door was left half-open to give the entree and guest bathroom a bit of warmth.</p>
<p>Apparently 23ºC measured at the indoor unit (almost under the roof of the room) are 21ºC measured at the Honeywell
wall thermostat used by the old has heating, and 20.0ºC at knee height in the living room.
We get 20.7ºC at 1.80m height in the kitchen.
The single active wall unit was set to &ldquo;quiet&rdquo; mode, which is exactly that:
there is air movement, it is almost hearable but can be felt,
and sometimes you can hear the mechanics in the indoor unit reposition the air-guides, quietly and carefully.</p>
<p>Learnings:</p>
<ul>
<li>At 8ºC dropping to 3ºC outdoor temperature at night, a single indoor unit in quiet mode can keep the ground floor stable.</li>
<li>You need to set temperatures agressively, 23ºC at 2.20m room height are 21ºC at 1.60m and 20ºC at 70cm height,
there is clear thermal layering.</li>
<li>21ºC in the living room are 20.7ºC in the kitchen, which is way better than expected.</li>
</ul>
<p>The original estimate was using 4 MWh/year electrical power for heating (around 1200 Euro/year), instead of 12 MWh gas
(around 1500 Euro/year at current pricing).
I do not expect to overshoot this,
but it may be that we actually end up with considerably less energy usage in the coming year.</p>
<p>All in all the solution works, and performs at least as well as projected.</p>
