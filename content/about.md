This is an attempt to revive the blog with Hugo.
Initially it was running on Github Pages with the default build, using Jekyll.
With that, it takes around 120 seconds to build the blog.
Using Hugo, we are done in under 10 seconds.

Hugo and Jekyll are static page generators.
The blog is written in Markdown, and then transformed by Hugo into HTML.
This is being published.
