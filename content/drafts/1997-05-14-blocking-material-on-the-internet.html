<h3>Summary</h3>

Like any other communication medium, the Internet is used also for
the dissemination of radical right-wing information, child
pornography, etc. Such misuse has recently led to calls for state
intervention to enforce centralized blocking of certain materials. 

<p>The authors take the view that such action would be
inappropriate. All technological approaches for implementing such
blocking have so far failed, and it can be assumed that, with the
Internet structure being what it is, future approaches will fail as
well. Secondly, blocking will always affect material that is not
intended to be blocked. The more effective the blocking action, the
more serious the undesired side effects.</p>

<p>Decentralized blocking approaches would enable users to filter
content themselves. If rating of content is performed by private
organizations therating mechanism could be used to promote
questionable interests. To avoid the risk of misuse, it is
absolutely necessary that all rating criteria and all ratings are
disclosed.</p>

<p>State regulation of any kind will increase costs. The effort to
rate Internet material is expected to involve high payroll costs.
But even today the cost of communication is substantially higher in
Germany than in competing countries like the United States.
Regulation would hence be a competitive disadvantage.</p>

<h3>What is the objective of blocking?</h3>

Before discussing the technical means of blocking material
accessible on the Internet and the prospects of achieving such
blocking, it is necessary to identify the goals to be achieved by
blocking. Potential goals include: <br>
&nbsp; 

<ul>
<li><b>Law enforcement:</b> preventing the subjects of a national
or regional legal system from accessing or publishing material
which is illegal as measured by the criteria of such legal system,
even if the place of publication is outside the jurisdiction of the
legal system concerned. Using technical means to render such
offences impossible would be the perfect solution.</li>

<li><b>Prohibiting the provision of indecent material:</b> Various
parts of the US Communication Decency Act (CDA) tried to establish
an even stricter rule: the Act prohibited the provision, via data
networks, of material which is indecent, obscene or in some other
way offensive as measured by contemporary moral standards (for
"free speech" see for instance <a href="http://www.eff.org/">The
Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (EFF).</li>

<li><b>Protection of minors:</b> Access by minors (children and
adolescents) to harmful material is to be prevented while adults
would continue to be able to access the complete range of material
offered on the Internet.</li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> All users of the Net would continue to be free
to choose the material they wish to receive, but a rating mechanism
would be established enabling consumers to indicate their own
preferences ("no sexual material" /"a lot of sexual material", /"no
violent material" /"blood and splatter", "politically left-wing"/
"politically right-wing material", "content that is in conformity
with the moral standards of the Catholic Church" /"correct in
accordance with Muslim moral standards"); consequently consumers
only receive that portion of Internet material which passes the
filter chosen by them.</li>

<li><b>Non-regulation:</b> Every user would have free access to all
information offered. Even the existence of rating criteria applied
by third parties is considered detrimental, and the establishment
of a rating infrastructure is not encouraged or even
discouraged..</li>
</ul>

<h3>Which services are discussed in this paper?</h3>

"Material provided on the Internet" is understood to mean content
accessible through a number of services which use completely
different technologies and many of which have separate
administrative structures. The only common feature of all these
services is the data transmission protocol TCP/IP, which serves as
a joint basis. 

<p>There are at least two services to be distinguished:</p>

<ul>
<li>W<b>WW, World Wide Web:</b> The World Wide Web is the
graphically most appealing service of the Internet. This service is
rendered by a network of servers which, on request, furnish the
user with "pages" containing the requested material by delivering
them to the browser of the user's computer. As a rule, access to
these pages is provided by means of the HyperText Transport
Protocol (HTTP). For this protocol no identification or
authentification of the user and the provider is necessary; the
data transmitted are plaintext and not tamperproof.</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p>An optional modification of HTTP communicates requests and
replies by using the encryption technique called Secure Socket
Layer (SSL). At least providers using this system have to inform
the person making the request of their identity. Furthermore the
SSL system prevents monitoring of the plaintext of the
communication (third parties cannot find out what requests were
made and what the subject matter of the pages provided is) and
ensures that the material concerned cannot be falsified undetected
by third parties during transmission.</p>

<p>The pages provided contain formatting instructions in the
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and, if requested, further visual,
sound or video data. Small servers often can provide the pages
requested only as a pre-produced database supplied unchanged from
their hard disks. Big servers, by contrast, frequently produce the
requested pages on an individual basis, i.e. depending on the
user's identity, his or her Net address, the national language
preferred (can be configured in the browser), the type of browser
employed by the user, the exact time of request or other
programmable criteria. This means that two successive requests of
the same page will not always result in identical replies.</p>

<p>If pages from the database are produced dynamically, the data of
the Web server may be subject to constant change as a result of the
updates of the database. This is what happens for instance in the
case of catalogue systems for online commerce (price and product
updates, changed inventory affecting delivery, etc.), news agencies
connected to press release and ticker services and in the case of
Web inventories and search engines which generate a full-text index
for pages and permit searches by subjects.</p>

<p>In general the Web database is highly dynamic: new versions of
pages can be produced and marketed at very low cost. The electronic
nature of the medium and its centralized data storage (no
distributed copies of a page have to be updated) are clear
advantages for producing a very large number of copies.</p>
</li>

<li><b>USENET news</b>: USENET is a distributed system of
newsgroups. It is a partially interconnected network of servers,
each of which stores a selection of articles ready to be supplied
on request. As a rule, the articles are filed in accordance with
thematically arranged newsgroups and time of receipt. Users can
establish a link to the most favourably located server and request
articles selected by news group and date of receipt.</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p>Users can follow up on any article read or can post their own
articles to the server. The server will then inform its neighboring
servers that it has a new article available and, where appropriate,
will feed this article to its neighboring servers. These, in turn,
will communicate the article to their neighboring servers, etc.
(flood fill algorithm of USENET). Within a few hours' time there
are hundreds or thousands of copies of this article available
throughout the world. The cross-linking of servers is highly
redundant; interruptions on the server routes usually have no or
only local effects on the availability or transport speed of the
articles.</p>

<p>To gain space, the longest held articles are deleted after a
certain period of time, which is determined by the configuration of
the individual server and by the space needed. As a rule, it does
not exceed a period of two weeks. Some news archives, however,
store news group discussions for several years and make this
database accessible via ample search capabilities (e.g. <a href=
"http://www.dejanews.com/">Dejanews</a>, <a href=
"http://www.altavista.digital.com/">AltaVista</a> in the news
mode).</p>

<p>As every user reading such articles can reply to any of these
articles directly and without any pre-editing or post-editing, the
results are unmoderated public discussions about a wide range of
topics. A large part of these news group discussions are conducted
globally. Hence the participants in newsgroup discussions come from
all over the world and group membership is constantly changing.</p>

<p>Communication between user and server as well as communication
among servers are usually not encrypted and take place without
identification or authentification of the users or authors of
articles. Falsifying the address of the sender or the path of an
article is very easy and even common practice with some newsgroups.
There are converters from e-mail to USENET news as well as
anonymous and pseudonymous servers which use cryptographic methods,
some of them very effective, to try to conceal the sender's
identity and location within the Net. Some news servers allow any
user or author access without requiring authentification (open
servers): it is up to the authors to decide whether or not they
wish to disclose their identity in the article provided.</p>

<p>It is the operator of a server who decides which newsgroups can
be accessed via its server. There are some lists of "official"
newsgroups, but usually they are neither complete nor binding for
anyone. Names or headings of newsgroups have the nature of
recommendations only. Off-topic postings or spam make up a fixed
percentage of all articles.</p>
</li>
</ul>

The <i>IRC</i> service (<i>Internet Relay Chat</i>) and <i>
e-mail</i> (private electronic mail and semi-public mailing lists
as discussion forums) could also be discussed in this paper.
However, to make this analysis compact, we do not wish to discuss
them here, since they are not at the centre of public debate. A
discussion would lead to similar results as in the case of the
World Wide Web and USENET news. There are other services most of
which are of less importance for public communication
(<i>telnet</i>) or the discussion of which would not reveal any new
aspects (<i>ftp</i>, see <i>http</i>). 

<h3>How can the material to be blocked be identified?</h3>

In order to block material reliably it is necessary first to
identify such material in some way. The resolution of such
identification may vary. 

<p>An individual computer can be identified on the basis of IP
addresses. However, the identified computer usually performs a
large number of services for several providers. Some Web servers of
IP providers feed the material of thousands of information content
providers into the Net under one single IP address; computers of
small providers in some cases offer all the provider's services
under one single IP number. The blocking of IP numbers consequently
affects not only the material to be blocked but also a large amount
of material and services that were not intended to be blocked.</p>

<p>By expending more cost and effort, it is possible to identify
service-specific characteristics of individual units of the
material provided. In the World Wide Web, a page is characterized
by its "name" (its <i>Universal Resource Locator</i> - <i>URL</i>),
while the USENET news uses message ID of an individual news item or
the name of a news group as means of identification. For newly
emerging services it is necessary to devise new service-specific
methods for identifying individual units.</p>

<p>The amount of data to be identified and rated is huge: In May
1996, 30 million Web pages were stored in the full-text database of
the <a href="http://www.altavista.digital.com/">Altavista</a>
search engine; in April 1997 the amount of data recorded exceeded
72 gigabyte for some 5.4 million articles (statistics supplied by
Eunet Deutschland GmbH taken from <a href="news:de.admin.lists">
de.admin.lists</a> of 1 May 1997).</p>

<p>There is still the problem of isolating the material to be
blocked from all other material. There are two completely different
ways to do this:</p>

<ul>
<li>automatic rating of material by looking for formal
characteristics such as whether the text contains certain key
words,</li>

<li>manual rating of material by providers or third parties using a
set of criteria (<i>rating</i>).</li>
</ul>

Automatic rating of material by using key words is a complete
failure when applied to components containing no text (audio files,
images or animations). Several online services (Prodigy, AOL) tried
to have discussions rated in chat rooms similar to the IRC service
by using certain key words, but the results have been hardly
satisfactory. One result was that normal discussions on certain
topics were no longer possible: blocking of the word "suck" made it
difficult to exchange views and experience concerning
vacuum-cleaners in a housekeeping news group; blocking of the word
"breast" was a handicap in discussions on breast cancer and cooking
recipes ("chicken breast"); and the pages fed into the Web by Mrs
Cindy Tittle Moore (tittle@netcom.com) were blocked by the
Cybersitter program on account of her name. 

<p>Another result of blocking was that the group whose material was
blocked simply changed its vocabulary so that blocking had only
negligible effects on the group's material. There are other
automatic rating methods, but they are unable, too, to recognize
the meaning of the material to be rated. Knowledge of these formal
blocking criteria enables newsgroups to re-formulate their
information without changing its meaning so as to avoid the words
that would "trigger" blocking. The Cybersitter program designed to
protect children is able, for example, to cut from the Web pages
those passages containing words rated offensive. Ingenious
formulation of a statement will ensure that its meaning is reversed
when the statement is viewed under control of the Cybersitter
filter program (information and example by Bennett Haselton on the
mailing list <a href="mailto:fight-censorship@vorlon.mit.edu">
fight-censorship@vorlon.mit.edu</a>, message ID:
&lt;01IAZF6R8I0I8XKGCV@ctrvax.vanderbilt.edu&gt;).</p>

<p>Procedures and standards for the rating of material by providers
or third parties have already been developed for the World Wide
Web, with <a href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/PICS/">PICS</a>
currently being the leading system (Platform for Internet Content
Selection). With PICS it is possible to install rating criteria of
any definition and any desired resolution. URLs can be rated by the
information content providers themselves or by third parties.
Common rating criteria include violence, sex or indecent language,
with rating systems ranging from digital 0 to 1 scales to systems
with very fine ratings. The PICS ratings can be evaluated either by
the user's client program (currently supported by the Microsoft
Internet Explorer) or on routers while the material is being
transferred to the user (this procedure is not being used as
yet).</p>

<p>The main problem with manual rating of content is coping with
the large number of new or modified pages generated. The operator
of the news server <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/">
www.msnbc.com</a> (a joint venture by NBC and Microsoft) has
discontinued the rating of its content by means of the RSACi rating
system supported by Microsoft, because the rating of individual
contributions was too costly and laborious and PICS rating of all
material offered by the server would have prevented minors to
access the server (see exchange of letters between Irene Graham,
Michael Sims, Stephen Balkam (RSAC rating supervision) and Danielle
Bachelder (MSNBC system operation) quoted in
&lt;3339dd1a.500215@mail.thehub.com.au&gt; and
&lt;199703191314.IAA03203@arutam.inch.com&gt; on the same mailing
list).</p>

<p>Another difficulty is that a Web page may differ depending on
the characteristics of its request so that rating by means of the
PICS system would cause problems. Precisely the pages making use of
the interactive component of the Internet could, due to their
dynamic generation, remain unrated and would hence no longer be
displayed by browsers and search engines of appropriate
configuration.</p>

<p>The rating of material by using the PICS system is currently
performed by private organizations. The possibilities of raising
objections to a certain rating are limited: It is difficult for a
netizen to demand correct rating, in particular if the rating
organization is located abroad. This difficulty is similar to that
encountered by prosecutors trying to punish providers of illegal
content originating in a foreign country, but it is completely
different in terms of availability of resources and burden of
proof. In case of incorrect rating, content providers have to prove
that their material is not illegal and they have to overcome the
difficulty of asserting their claims outside their own country.
Compared with prosecutors, providers of Web pages are on average
less well trained and have fewer resources at their disposal.</p>

<p>Rating organizations make their judgements in accordance with
the values and cultural criteria common in their own countries. The
adoption of foreign ratings for German users therefore causes
problems. But since there is no German access software, it is very
common to support only foreign rating systems (in particular US
systems).</p>

<p>Most rating organizations do not disclose their rating criteria
or are very reluctant to do so. Some of them do not even inform
content providers about the rating of the material they provided.
Complete inventories of all ratings awarded are usually kept secret
because it is argued that these lists might be used as catalogues
of trash and obscene material. In the case of programs which
receive ratings of the Web pages produced by third parties not
through online means but have the ratings included as a database
installed on the local hard disk, this list is always encrypted
and, more often than not, outdated. This means that the users of
such software are not aware of the material which they are
prevented from accessing.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there are (illegally) decrypted versions of the
blocking lists of all producers of rating programs with a static
blocking list supplied as a database. An evaluation of blockings
has shown that all producers act in line with clear political
attitudes or out of personal enmity. Content frequently censored
included material provided by women's organizations, information
provided on abortion as well as content provided by gay and lesbian
groups. It is also common to include in the blocking lists those
Web pages which contain criticisms of the producer of the blocking
program, disclose the blocking list or oppose any rating. The
producers of the Cybersitter program have even adopted a practice
which means that people having installed the Cybersitter program
can no longer access those pages which mention the names of critics
of the Cybersitter program.</p>

<h3>How can blocking be achieved?</h3>

Blocking can be effected at different levels of Internet
communication: 

<p>In order to be able to communicate with each other, the two
partners communicating need some physical link such as a dedicated
line, a telephone line or a radio relay link. One way of blocking
such a link, which is normally not practicable, would be to prevent
physical communication from taking place, for instance by barring a
telephone line or making certain telephone numbers inaccessible, by
disconnecting a dedicated line or by inserting a jamming
transmitter into a radio relay link. As a result, the victim of
blocking is usually deprived of all its means of
telecommunication.</p>

<p>Communication within the Internet usually does not use a
homogeneous physical link but a link consisting of various elements
of different technologies. At the connection points between these
elements, there is a router that transfers IP packets from one
element to the next. For this process, the operations of the router
are controlled by the adresses in the individual IP packets and by
its routing tables. The routing tables indicate the direction into
which the router has to transmit the packets labeled with a certain
destination. The typical service of a provider is selling
international connectivity via one or more leased lines to
locations abroad for dial-up customers (private customers) or
customers with a leased line (business customers). The service
provider is not aware of the type of services used by the customer
or the requested data.</p>

<p>Blocking can be achieved by interfering with the routing tables
of the routers. It is easy, for instance, to discard all packet
bound for certain destinations when they arrive at the router
("<i>grounding the route</i>"). This is done by grounding the
route. In this way entire computers are made inaccessible: when the
DFN-Verein (DFN = Deutsches Forschungsnetz - German Research
Network Association) blocked the computer named <a href=
"http://www.xs4all.nl/">www.xs4all.nl,</a> the Web pages of more
than 6,000 information content providers could no longer be
obtained, no mail could be fed into the computer www.xs4all.nl, and
all other communication between the DFN-Verein and the computer was
interrupted.</p>

<p>In accordance with the TCP/IP protocol, a service is usually
selected by indicating a TCP port number. By using this port
number, a more selective blocking of a service would be possible.
If being given the appropriate configuration, some routers are, for
instance, able to prevent TCP traffic for port 80 (HTTP) from
reaching a certain destination while permitting traffic on port 25
(mail) destined for the same address.</p>

<p>By using a <i>proxy</i> or other firewall software which have
access to the higher levels of the network structure, selective
blocking at the level of individual pages or news items can be
achieved. For this purpose, however, the firewall software has to
be adapted to each service concerned (WWW, news, mail, IRC, etc.).
As a rule, the operation of such systems is very cumbersome and
costly, because, for the clients using them, they have to simulate
full rendering of all services used by the client. It is very
difficult to scale up these systems when the number of clients
increases. Nevertheless they are being employed by several
totalitarian governments, which hope to make it difficult for
undesired material to enter their countries: In China, Singapore
and the Gulf countries all communication with abroad has to pass
through government-operated firewalls.</p>

<p>The blocking of IP addresses and the use of firewalls can, under
certain conditions, be combined to reduce the workload of the
firewall computer. Rather than grounding the route to a computer
that is to be blocked, all routes to the computer to be blocked are
directed to a firewall which monitors the services provided by the
computer to be blocked. For this combined approach, which has to be
adapted to each type of service to be blocked and simulated,
technically complex and costly configurations and maintenance are
required. First of all there must be a central connection point
between the German network to be monitored and the rest of the
world. In addition, this technique is a typical
"<i>man-in-the-middle</i>" attack: it will fail in the case of
highly encrypted communication which is not vulnerable to such
attacks.</p>

<p>The adverse effect of filtering mechanisms on computer
performance increases as the resolution of blockings is raised and
the list of the information sources to be blocked is extended.
Systems such as PICS cannot be established efficiently at central
points of the network but can only function as decentralized
systems.</p>

<p>All blocking procedures discussed so far involve third-party
computers to be inserted between the provider of the information to
be blocked and the user. The blocking of material either at the
information provider's end or at the user's end are also
conceivable; this would, however, require cooperation of the
provider or the user.</p>

<p>Blocking at the provider's end would mean that the provider does
not offer the material to be blocked to anyone or that he offers it
to certain persons only. Even if providers are ready to cooperate,
offering material only to selected persons will be possible only if
providers can reliably identify the user of a piece of information
and have decision tables which are flawless and watertight from a
legal point of view, enabling them to automatically decide which
material to deliver to whom. Today there is not even a rudimentary
identification mechanism which would achieve that goal, and no such
mechanism is expected to be developed and produced in the
foreseeable future. It is impossible in particular to infer the
sender's identity or physical residence from the IP address and the
computer name: German customers of US online services are
identified on the Net as residents of the United States. Almost the
same is true of staff members of multinational companies.</p>

<p>Blocking at the user's end would mean that the material offered
would have to be rated by using well-defined criteria (e.g. by
those of the PICS system) and that users themselves configurate
their software in such a way that pages given certain ratings can
no longer be requested and received. Cooperation by the provider
would be desirable, but is not necessary since rating can be
carried out by servers of third parties.</p>

<h3>How can blocking be evaded?</h3>

For users, the blocking of material is an operating problem. They
will try to restore full working power, which means they will try
to overcome blocking. Their efforts will be the greater, the more
they feel hampered as a result of the blocking. 

<p>If the physical communication link is interrupted through
blocking, the only solution will be to use a different means of
communication: if, for example, a jamming transmitter interrupts
the radio relay link, it is still possible to use the telephone
network and if a telephone line is barred, a radio relay link will
be used..</p>

<p>If certain IP addresses are blocked, there are several
possibilities for the user to solve the problem: all of them are
aimed at completely avoiding the blocking router (see <a href=
"http://www.fitug.de/ulf/zensur/">Ulf M&ouml;ller:
"Internet-Zensur: Routingsperren umgehen</a>"):<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>The user changes his Internet provider; if necessary, he
becomes a customer of a provider located abroad. He establishes a
telephone connection or a dedicated line to this provider and
handles all his communication via this non-blocking provider. He no
longer uses the blocking router of the local provider, and
consequently blocking no longer bars his way to obtaining the
information desired.<br>
<br>
This change of provider in case of blockings takes place
automatically if the user is a staff member of a (multinational)
company with its own Intranet, which is linked to the Internet at
several locations (abroad).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
</li>

<li>The user becomes a customer of a second, non-blocking Internet
provider, if necessary a foreign provider. The user establishes a
TCP/IP connection to this provider and has his applications handled
by the distant computer, if necessary a computer located
abroad.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There are now a number of providers offering such services as a
routine matter. The services provided range from individual
services (e-mail boxes, e.g. <a href="http://www.pobox.com/">
pobox.com</a>, Web services, e.g. <a href=
"http://www.geocities.com/">geocities.com</a> etc.) to complete
exile log-ins (e.g. <a href="http://www.c2.org/">c2.org</a>.<a
href="http://www.acm.org/">acm.org</a>.<a href=
"http://www.xs4all.nl/">xs4all.nl</a>).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The blocking router of the local provider does not register any
communication with the blocked address but only communication with
the distant provider. Access to the blocked addresses is effected
via the distant provider, that is from behind the blocking router.
The blocking caused by the router ceases to have effect.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
</li>

<li>The user becomes a customer of a second, non-blocking Internet
provider, if necessary a provider located abroad. The user
establishes a mobile IP connection to this provider. This means
that his IP packet are packed into other IP packet, are sent to the
second Internet provider, are unpacked there and are fed into the
Net. If desired, communication with the second provider can be
encrypted.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In Linux the following two commands have to be given for this
procedure:</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<ol>
<li>Activating of the <tt>tunl0</tt> interface to the distant
provider <tt>myriad.ml.org</tt>&nbsp;<br>
<tt>&gt; ifconfig tunl0 (your.ip.address) pointopoint
myriad.ml.org</tt></li>

<li>Establishing a route to <tt>www.xs4all.nl</tt> via <tt>
tunl0</tt>&nbsp;<br>
<tt>&gt; route add www.xs4all.nl tunl0</tt>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
To an observer, the user appears to be a normal customer of the
second IP provider. The blocking router of the local provider only
registers a connection to the distant, second provider. Hence
blocking is without effect: Mobile IP is a routine service for IP
providers serving business customers.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

The content provider of the information blocked can assist the user
by trying himself to evade blocking. When the computer
www.xs4all.nl was blocked, the blocked content provider changed the
Internet address of his computer every other quarter of an hour. As
a result, blockings of individual addresses had no effect; entire
parts of networks had to be blocked now, which meant that blocking
became even more unspecific, and another side effect was that even
more content providers were blocked although they had nothing to do
with the target to be blocked. 

<p>While the methods for evading blockings that have been discussed
above can be applied to any service blocked, the following methods
can be used for specific services:</p>

<h4>WWW</h4>

<ol>
<li>Automatically changing the address of the page on a server is
an approach similar to that of modifying the IP number of a server
computer. The automatic blocking of individual pages would thus be
evaded, and again the entire computer would have to be blocked.
Such general blocking could again be overcome by applying the
methods for evading complete blocking.</li>

<li>If there is a search engine for a service which can search all
pages of the server material by using certain terms, then an
individual page can be obtained virtually under any address, namely
by using the terms which help to find a text in the database of the
search engine. In this case blocking would have to prevent access
to the search engine, too.</li>

<li>The indirect access approach discussed in connection with the
mobile IP method can, if modified, be used also for the WWW. By
using a distant Web server providing access on behalf of third
parties (<i>proxy server</i>), it is possible to request the page
desired in an indirect way. Since proxy servers having an
intermediate storage are a common tool used to speed up delivery,
it is usually easy to find such a third server. The recent
censorhip debate has led to the setting-up in Germany and abroad of
proxy servers explicitly for evading blockings (there is a proxy
server at MIT, for instance, for Chinese nationals wishing to avoid
censorship in their own country).</li>

<li>If communication is encrypted (for example by using the SSL
support incorporated in all common browsers), a secure channel
between the server and the user is created in which real-time
understanding is not possible and falsification is not easy. Third
parties are not able to identify the pages requested nor the
information they contain.</li>
</ol>

<h4>News</h4>

<ol>
<li>Numerous copies of articles posted to the USENET news are
available on thousands of servers all over the world. Calls to
cancel articles are meanwhile ignored by many of these servers
since there have again and again been fake cancellation calls made
by saboteurs. The large archives for USENET news (DejaNews and
AltaVista) never make any cancellations. By sending a request to an
archive, it is usually possible to get access to less recent texts
and those which cannot be obtained locally. Like Web pages that can
be located by means of search engines (see above), articles can be
requested and found not only by indicating their message ID, but
also by checking for any key word contained in the article.</li>

<li>During an investigation conducted by prosecutors in Bavaria,
Compuserve was called upon to no longer provide access to some
newsgroups since the articles from these newsgroups had been found
to mostly contain material which is considered illegal in Germany.
Users who wish to access and read the articles of these groups now
request them directly from other, non-blocking news servers. Also
the authors of articles for poorly disseminated newsgroups
increasingly tend to post their articles also to other groups that
are well disseminated but deal with a completely different topic.
For example, when the server www.xs4all.nl was blocked because it
had offered the prohibited journal "Radikal, Ausgabe 154", the
complete volume of "Radikal" was posted to the newsgroups "<a href=
"news:de.soc.zensur">de.soc.zensur</a>" (discussion on censorship
and monitoring of content) and "<a href=
"news:de.org.politik.spd">de.org.politik.spd</a>" (news group of
the virtual local association of the SPD).</li>

<li>Since new newsgroups can be established automatically, poorly
disseminated groups are often re-established under new names or
notorious newsgroups offer their services under aliases. This is
illustrated by the following example: after a German university
decided that groups whose name contained the word "sex" should no
longer be offered, a group previously called <a href=
"news:de.talk.sex">de.talk.sex</a> (a news group on sexuality) has
been made available under the alias name de.talk.verkehr for
several years.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Other effects of blocking attempts</h3>

Any blocking can be overcome by replicating the information
blocked. Each copy of the information replicated has to be blocked
separately. As a result, the undesired side effects of blocking are
multiplied until the costs of blocking exceed its benefit. When
www.xs4all.nl was blocked because it had offered the banned volume
"Radikal 154", 40 copies of the information blocked appeared within
a very short time. However, the pages of the 6,000 content
providers which had unintendedly been blocked, too, because of
technical reasons were not replicated. Blocking was
counterproductive: instead of preventing dissemination, the
blocking led to the replication of the blocked information. At the
same time many content providers suffered losses as a result of the
unintended side effects. 

<p>By means of the USENET news network, information can
automatically be replicated thousandfold with a minimum effort.
That is why the Web pages of the Radikal journal were disseminated
in the news after the xs4all had been blocked (the Web pages of the
other 6,000 customers of xs4all were not fed into the news).</p>

<p>Because of the protocol design, all communication using the
TCP/IP protocol is an individual end-to-end communication between
two partners. Even an observer monitoring a piece of information
cannot find out whether the information requested is of a private
nature (it is possible and - for many users also - necessary to
read their private mail through WWW) or whether it is of a public
nature. Private as well as public information can even appear
together on a Web page. It is doubtful whether monitoring of such
communication by unspecific interception (without a judicial
decision having been sought) is legal, even if such monitoring is
performed by a robot responding to keywords or ratings.</p>

<p>Disclosure of any and all blockings effected is absolutely
necessary not only in order to supervise those awarding the
ratings, but also in the interest of smooth technical operation of
the network. If a huge number of computers or individual pages is
blocked, neither the individual operator of a computer nor the
individual user will know whether there is a technical defect that
can be eliminated or whether some content has been blocked.
Reliable error analysis by the operators of networks or individual
computers is thus made totally impossible: from the fact that there
is some operational problem no reliable conclusion can be drawn as
to what action should be taken to solve the problem. On the other
hand, blocking lists, if published, of course tend to be misused as
catalogues of sexually explicit or violent materials. Blocking
could thus be turned into a kind of "quality label". Moreover,
disclosed blockings can be overcome automatically by means of
programs modified for the purpose.</p>

<h3>Modification of the Internet</h3>

It is obvious from the above that blocking of material on the
Internet with its present characteristics can only be implemented
at inacceptable costs and side effects. These findings lead on to
the question of how the Internet would have to be modified to
permit effective blocking of certain materials. 

<p>In principle, firewall systems (employed by companies to protect
their network from unauthorized entry from the Internet) provide a
suitable approach to achieve effective blocking. The philosophy of
allowing through only those data which are explicitly allowed to
cross the barrier helps to enforce certain guidelines or codes of
conduct.</p>

<p>Similarly, a code of conduct would have to be established for
the use of the Internet services, and adherence of users to this
code be enforced. This can be ensured by employing the firewall
technology as a barrier between users and the Internet or by using
proprietary protocols. Some essential requirements of such a code
would be: subscribers can only use the network if they identify
themselves; services, protocols and data formats have to be
authorized before they can be used; the use of cryptographic
techniques is prohibited and all activities have to be logged.
These rules would ensure that users cannot evade blockings by
changing their identity, the protocol or by disguising data.</p>

<p>If we leave aside the question whether such a code of conduct
would be compatible with a democracy based on the rule of law,
there are still economic and technical reasons against enforcing
this kind of guidelines. A network functioning in accordance with
such rules would be under centralized control and could be not
adapted to changing requirements without spending a tremendous
amount of time and money. Pressured by their commercial users, all
online services have given up this concept. The administrative
overhead of such a solution at the national level would be
enormous. Also, any restriction with regard to cryptographic
techniques would prejudice the use of the Internet for transmitting
sensitive information.</p>

<p>Altogether such a type of Internet could be disastrous for a
country's competitiveness. Communication is an economic resource by
no means less important than human capital or the transportation
infrastructure. On the other hand, China's example has shown that
even such a type of Internet would prevent the dissemination of
unwanted material only to a limited extent because counter-measures
have been devised for any of the measures mentioned above.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

Centralized, selective blocking of material on the Internet without
side effects cannot be implemented; it would be evaded by users, if
necessary, and it would entail high costs (confer Heimo Ponnath:
"<a href=
"http://bda.netuse.de/bda/jp/home/heimo.ponnath/articles/SiN.html">Pornographie
im Internet?</a> Dichtung und Wahrheit (Pornography on the
Internet? Facts and fiction)", inside online 2/3 1996). As a result
of the operation of global data networks, changes take place with
regard to government tasks in the information society. This has
been described by Alexander Ro&szlig;nagel in "Globale Datennetze:
Ohnmacht des Staates - Selbstschutz der B=FCrger (Global data
networks: Powerless government - self-protection by citizens)", ZRP
1977, Heft 1, 26-30). The "feeling of powerlessness" in our
globalized world need not, however, lead governments to surrender
in the face of the newly emerging dangers; modern information
technologies provide numerous possibilities for citizens to protect
themselves. Hence governments should accept the obligation to
establish structures "which enable their citizens to safeguard
their interests in today's world of networks on their own." 

<p>Decentralized control and filtering by users themselves provide
a suitable approach for solving the problem. If this approach is to
be successful, the ratings awarded by third parties (using the PICS
system, for instance) and the rating criteria used must be made
transparent. Exemplary filter configurations can be proposed by a
large number of interest groups; but users must be in a position to
design their own individual configurations or adapt other
configurations to their own needs.</p>

<p>Universal rating by a system such as PICS involves more time
effort and additional costs. Therefore, a number of providers will
not offer universal rating. The rating organizations bear great
responsibility because any preliminary rating will influence the
opinions of potential users and because deliberately or
unintentionally false ratings may cause great damage=2E For
ensuring the protection of minors on the Internet, the approach of
labelling material suitable for children by providers on a
voluntary basis and displaying such material by means of special
"child browsers" similar to the TV children's channel would be by
far cheaper and less controversial (see "<a href=
"http://www.thehub.com.au/rene/liberty/label.htm">The Net Labeling
Delusion: Protection or Oppression</a>").</p>

<p>Experience in the United States has shown that organizations use
the rating tool for pursuing their own political goals while
pretending to aim at the protection of minors or to maintain
decency standards. However, private organizations must not become
responsible for defining moral, ethical and social values. The risk
of ratings being misused for other purposes can be reduced by
disclosing the rating criteria used as well as all ratings.</p>
