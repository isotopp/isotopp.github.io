![](/uploads/bloodsucking_fiends.jpg)*[Bloodsucking Fiends](http://www.amazon.de/Bloodsucking-Fiends-Christopher-Moore/dp/0060735414/)* Gelangweilter 800 Jahre alter Supervampir beißt irischstämmige amerikanische Versicherungsangestellte mit mangelndem Selbstbewusstsein, die kurz vor ihrer Midlife-Crisis steht - und erschafft ein Monster.Aber Christopher Moore bleibt nicht bei einem Erzählstrang. Gleich Douglas Adams lässt er seine Geschichten in kleine Seiten- und Abseitenlinien laufen, getreu dem Motto:Lieber einen guten Freund verlieren, als eine gute Pointe auszulassen.Zur Dekoration klebt er eine Reihe von Filmzitaten und Popkultur-Referenzen mit in die Story rein, einfach, weil es zu schade wäre, es nicht zu tun.Mein Favorit: Die Gefängnisszene. Tommy, Vampir-Jodies neuer Freund oder Ghoul, er weiß es nicht so genau, sitzt aus Gründen, die hier zu erklären zu weit führen würden, im Knast.> Tommy guessed the temperature in the cell to be about sixty-five, but even so, his cellmate, the six-foot-five, two-hundred-fifty-pound, unshaven, unbathed, one-eyed psychopath with the Disney-character tattoos, was dripping with sweat.> > Maybe, Tommy thought, as he cowered in the corner behind the toilet, it's warmer up there on the bunk. > Or maybe it's hard work trying to stare at someone menacingly, without blinking, for six hours when you have ony one eye.> > "I hate you", said One-Eye.> "Sorry", said Tommy.> One-Eye stood up and flexed his biceps; Micky and Goofy bulged angrily.> "Are you making fun of me?"> Tommy didn't want to say anything, so he shook his head violently, trying to make sure that nothing remotely resembling a smile crossed his face.> > One-Eye sat down on the bunk and resumed menacing. "What are you in for?"> "Nothing", Tommy said. "I didn't do anything."> "Don't fuck with me, ass-wipe. What were you arrested for?"> > Tommy fidgeted, trying to work his way into the cinder-block wall.> "Well, I put my girlfriend in the freezer, but I don't think that's a crime."> One-Eye, for the first time he'd been put in the cell, smiled. "Me either. You didn't use an assault weapon, did you?"> "Nope, a Sears frost-free."> "Oh, good; they're really tough on crimes with assault weapons."> > "So," Tommy says, venturing an inch out of the corner, "what are you in for?" Thinking baby-stomping, thinking cannibalism, thinking fast-food massacre.> One-Eye hung his head. "Copyright infringement."> > "You're kidding?"> One-Eye frowned.> Tommy slid back into his corner, adding, "Really? That's bad."> > One-Eye pulled of his ratty T-shirt.> The seven dwarfs danced across his massive chest between knife and bullet scars. > On his stomach, Snow White and Cinderella were locked in a frothy embrace of mutual muffin munching.> "Yeah, I made the mistake of walking around without a shirt. > A Disney executive who was up here on vacation saw me down be the wharf. > He called their legal pit bulls."> > Tommy shook his head in sympathy.> "I didn't know they put you in jail for copyright infringement."> "Well, they don't, really. It was when I ripped the guy's shoulder out of their sockets that the police got involved."> "That's not a crime, either, is it?"> One-Eye rubbed his temples as if it was excruciating to remember. "It was in front of his kids."> "Oh," Tommy said.> > "Flood, on your feet," a guard said from the cell door.> Inspector Nick Cavuto stood behind him.> "C'mon, cutie," Cavuto said. "We're going for a last walk."
