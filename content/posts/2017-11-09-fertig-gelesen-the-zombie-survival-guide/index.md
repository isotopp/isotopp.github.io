Max Brooks, author of World War Z, delivers a straight on, zero
tongue in cheek, nitty-gritty survival guide for the coming
Zombie Apocalypse. The book delivers exactly what is promised in
the table of contents: The Solanum Virus and how it works and
does not work, Weapons and Combat Techniques that work,
defending your home, public spaces or other places, how to
organise a breakout or run, useful equipment to have or to loot,
and then fighting back and finally containing the outbreak. 

The book concludes with a list of documented outbreaks in the
past, and their handling. The book is written completely
straight and is full of useful advice for fighting a Zombie
Apocalypse or containing an outbreak, but also a useful source
book for roleplaying and storytelling games.
