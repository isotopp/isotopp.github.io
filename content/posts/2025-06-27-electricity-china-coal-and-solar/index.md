China stands out—unlike EU countries—as a nation with rapidly growing energy demand.
According to Our World in Data, its electricity production is dominated by coal:

*"OMG! So much coal! China dooms us all!"*

Well, no.
We are looking at growth in a growing market, and that is complicated.
Let's switch to percentages...

![](2025/06/china-02.png)

Coal’s market share peaked at about 80% in 2007, but has since fallen to 58%—a 27-percentage point drop 
despite overall growth in electricity production.
So yes, coal’s dominance is shrinking, even as the total pie expands.

Investment flows confirm the shift: renewables are now drawing practically all of the capital.
And price-wise, renewable electricity is over 50% cheaper than fossil fuel alternatives.

# Near-term outlook: Fossils declining faster

China is approaching the plateau phase of its electricity demand curve (“S‑curve”).
Its National Energy Administration reported that at the end of 2023, 
total installed generation capacity hit 2.92 TW, a 13.9% increase year-on-year,
pushing per-capita installed capacity above 2 kW—doubling since 2014 
and nearing EU and German levels (2.42 kW and 3.22 kW respectively).
This suggests that capacity growth will saturate national demand within around five years.

- [The Chinese National Energy Agency writes](https://www.nea.gov.cn/2024-02/02/c_1310763217.htm):
  End of 23 the installed generative power was 2.92E9 kW, 13.9% YoY.
  The per-capita installed capacity was greater than 2 kW, up from below 1kW before 2014.

  China DID install a record amount of new coal capacity, 94.5 GW nominal capacity.
  It also decommissioned >100 GW existing capacity, this is fleet modernization.
  The new capacity is cleaner and has been specifically built as peakers.
  Their annual runtime hours are less than 50% and are declining.
- [China to establish coal power capacity price mechanism](https://coal.in-en.com/html/coal-2638401.shtml):
  This is an explicit policy goal; Classify and build fossil fuel power generation as peakers and bring down their hours.

Reuters:
> China has retired more than 100 GW of obsolete coal-fired power in the last decade, according to its energy regulator, 
> and new projects can only be built to provide back-up for renewable energy bases.

In 2015 a coal plant in China had a utilization of 5000h/a full power,
in 2022 it was <4300h/a (less than half of the 8760h a single year has).
There is now a two-price-system that pays plant operators for standby service.

# Natural gas: A minor player

- [Next stop for natural gas power generation](https://m.bjx.com.cn/mnews/20250324/1433631.shtml):

Natural Gas provides in China less than 5% of the total energy mix, a pure peaker fleet for stabilization.
It is utilized less than 2500h/a.

# Batteries and storage supporting the shift

Storage capacity in China is skyrocketing:
Electrochemical storage reached 73.8 GW / 168 GWh by end of 2024—up 130% year-over-year—with power-to-energy ratio ~2.3 kWh/kW.
Hydropower, including pumped storage, added 14.4 GW in 2024, and currently totals 58.8 GW, with another 200 GW planned.

- [China added 14.4 GW new hydropower capacity in 2024](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/power/china-added-14-4-gw-new-hydropower-capacity-in-2024-pumped-storage-capacity-at-58-69-gw-iha/122059778):
  Installed capacity at the end of 2024: 58.78 GW (+7.75 GW YoY), 200 GW in construction or planning with a target < 2030.

# What happens when per-capita demand peaks?

Once China's per-capita installed capacity levels off around 2.5–3.3 kW,
fossil fuels will decline even faster.
Renewables will displace them more aggressively, 
and China’s immense manufacturing base will pivot to exporting clean-energy technology—especially to solar-rich,
lower‑capacity countries in the Global South.

Globally, average per-capita capacity sits at roughly 1.1 kW. 
In many countries below this threshold, a modest 2 kWh battery can power a home overnight; 
5 kWh will have no challenges at all. 

Expect rising adoption of both:

- Decentralized solar + battery systems (e.g., Pakistan)
- Large-scale wind/solar farms + storage

All powered by Chinese technology.

# So, is China still a "coal monster"?

Yes.
But that changes rapidly.
Coal’s share is declining—new coal projects are largely serving as seasonal or hourly backup.
On many days, certain regions run entirely on renewables.
The coal fleet is being modernized—older plants retired and newer peakers commissioned.

Right now:
- Coal capacity is still large, and coal-fired generation remains significant.
- Grid weaknesses still limit renewables’ full potential, causing periods of curtailment.

But this is well understood and strategically being worked on.
