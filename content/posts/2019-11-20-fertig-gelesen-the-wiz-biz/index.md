[The Wiz Biz](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B01APMDJZU) by Rick Cook is
a book in the genre of 'magical realism'. Some real-world person
is being transported into a universe with predictable magic in a
classical fantasy setting and is applying scientic method and
industrial production methods to the setting.

In this book, the real-world person is Walter Zumwalt, a
stereotypical hacker, which as part of a hail-mary summoning
rital is being transported into a magical war between the good
guys and the bad guys. Walter does not know a thing about magic
at all, but apparently that can be learned and then turns out to
be a lot like computer programming, if you make it so.

This book is over 20 years old, and it shows. Not so much in the
computer programming aspects, but in the story telling, the
world views, and the usage of cliches, most of which did not age
well at all. The coding aspect is being introduced late to the
story, and is not well constructed. The storytelling is flat and
the characters are, well, cliche.

All in all a nice idea, but meh execution.
