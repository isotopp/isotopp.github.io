title: Google Chrome integrates Adblocker
---
The Ad and Adblock situations both are now so bad that even 
[Google considers integrating an Adblocker](https://www.blog.google/topics/journalism-news/building-better-web-everyone/)
by default into the Chrome browser. 

This is a twofold action. 

It's purpose is of course to filter out ads, the worst of the worst in
annoyance and the obvious malvertising. It's purpose is also to take back
control on adblocking, because it will let through 
[acceptable ads](https://www.betterads.org/standards) according to the 
[Coalition for Better Ads](https://www.betterads.org/) standards. 

CfBA condemns Popups, Sound, Prestitials and Large Stickies on the Desktop,
and more on mobile. It will be interesting to see if it changes anything.
People are truly beyond caring.
