Marnix Dekker has [an article on HTTPS
interception](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/9-reasons-intercept-https-marnix-dekker)
as it is being done in some workplaces. He lists:

- Are you serious? We worked so hard to make the web more secure and you are fucking it up.
- HSTS, you are breaking it.
- Blinds the browser and the user, because you re-encrypt with wildcard certs.
- Disrupts personal use.
- Breaks pinning and CT.
- Breaks with consumerization.
- Disrupts BYOD.
- Discourages good user practices.
- Limited benefits.
- and finally: Hard shell, soft inside is not going to work.
