It is now two years, since [we got the Megane e-Tech]({{< relref "2023-08-13-electric-cars-and-numbers.md" >}}).

# Energy

On a long distance drive in the Netherlands we use around 14.4 kWh/100 km at the maximum allowed speed, 100 km/h.
In Germany, I usually dial in 115 km/h, and we end up at 15.8 kWh/100 km or similar.

In the city, the energy consumption is variable, and we get anything between 14.5 kWh/100 km and 15.5 kWh/100 km.

A liter of Diesel has an energy content 10 kWh, 
so this would be the equivalent of the energy content of  1.5l Diesel/100 km.

The first few months of owning the Megane we did not have a cargepoint at home.
Instead we carged at a local Vattenfall chargepoint.
That involved parking around 400m away (two corners).
The cargepoint (2 connectors) usually was free, and charing did not require planning.
We paid around 0.32 EUR/kWh for that.

Since we got our own chargepoint the car is usually connected when arriving at home,
and is kept at 80% SoC.
Doing that takes about 15 seconds on arrival, and another 15 seconds on departure.
So I can say that "keeping an electric car charged" takes about 30 seconds.
The rest happens automatically, and I do not have to bother.

On the Autobahn, we stop approximately every two to 2.5h.
Getting a coffee, finding a toilet or buying a sandwich usually takes longer than
recharging the car at a fast charger.
In the Netherlands, this is invariably something by Fastned,
and I have yet to have a situation where not at least one connector was free immediately.
In Germany, the situation is less homogenous, but generally not critical at all.

Power at a fast charger can be expensive, but so far we have two "Charge Cards",
and that seems to cover us well in NL and DE.

# Reliability and Service

Some people report higher tire use in their electric cars, but I cannot confirm that for the Megane.
The car has a weight of 1.6 tons including the battery, which is pretty much the same as the Scenic Grande we had before.
It is not a particularly heavy car, and consequently I do not except higher tire use.

We bought his car preowned.
It was a demonstrator at the outlet, which we got at a good price.
There were several problems with the car, which took a long time to resolve:
Missing software update, and consequently light system malfunction,
problem with driver identity (the car did not store seat positions),
and several other comfort features.

It turned out that the dealership did an incomplete change of ownership, 
because identity and car records are stored in many different systems:
In the car, at Google, at Renault and at Orange, an Internet provider used by the car.
Actually resolving that and transferring the car took them multiple months to debug,
and then a two-day repair stopover at the dealership.
It seems the process is better documented because if that, which is good, I guess.

Since this intervention, the car had zero problems.

Driving electric is a revelation.
It is silent.
Power is "just there", no delay, no problems at low speeds, and then continuously as you accelerate.

Accelerating in sports mode is hilarious, and uses insane amounts of energy.
It is fun,though, to leave a car 4x the price in the dust at a traffic light.

# Summary

This is a modern car.
That means, it is a rolling bunker.
Vision from the inside out is bad: The A-pillar is so wide it creates blind spots,
and vision through the tiny window in the back is so bad that the rear mirror is a camera system.
I understand why that is, EU regulation (GSR-2) demands it, but it still sucks.
There are a sufficient number of cameras, collsion warners and similar things to compensate,
but you really do need these things in order to drive safely.

In the end I do not really think it's a win, but it works.

Sometimes I go to Germany in a rental car, because my wife needs the Megane at home.
This usually is a car with combustion engine.
Driving that sucks: Driving electric spoils you.
It is so much more convenient and comfortable.

We will never go back to combustion.
This is so much better.
