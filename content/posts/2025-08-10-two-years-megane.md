It has now been two years since [we got the Megane e-Tech]({{< relref "2023-08-13-electric-cars-and-numbers.md" >}}).

*The car uses Google Automotive Services (GAS). It is basically an Android with a really big battery pack.*



# Energy

On long-distance drives in the Netherlands, we use about 14.4 kWh/100 km at the maximum allowed speed of 100 km/h.
In Germany I usually dial in 115 km/h, and we end up at about 15.8 kWh/100 km.

In the city, energy consumption varies, and we see anywhere between 14.5 and 15.5 kWh/100 km.

A liter of diesel contains about 10 kWh of energy,
so that's roughly equivalent to 1.5 liters of diesel per 100 km.

For the first few months with the Megane we did not have a charge point at home.
Instead, we charged at a local Vattenfall charge point.
That involved parking around 400 m away (two corners).
The charge point (two connectors) was usually free, and charging did not require planning.
We paid around 0.32 EUR/kWh for that.

*When charging, the display looks like this.
This is at home, starting at 14% going up to 80%, at 11 kW.
This is not what you normally do.*

Since we got our own charge point the car is usually connected when arriving at home
and is kept at 80% state of charge (SoC).
Doing that takes about 15 seconds on arrival, and another 15 seconds on departure.
So I can say that "keeping an electric car charged" takes about 30 seconds.
The rest happens automatically, and I do not have to bother.

On the Autobahn, we stop approximately every 2 to 2.5 hours.
Getting a coffee, finding a toilet, or buying a sandwich usually takes longer than
recharging the car at a fast charger to 80%.
In the Netherlands, this is almost invariably a Fastned station,
and I have yet to encounter a situation where at least one connector wasn't immediately free.
In Germany, the situation is less homogeneous, but generally not critical at all.

Fast charging can be expensive, but so far we have two charge cards,
and that seems to cover us well in the Netherlands and Germany.

*The Scenic had USB-A. The Megane finally offers USB-C connectors for all seats.
I had to change out all USB cables in the car, but in the end it is much better.*

# Reliability and Service

Some people report higher tire wear in their electric cars, but I cannot confirm that for the Megane.
The car weighs 1.6 tonnes including the battery, which is pretty much the same as the Grand Scenic we had before.
It is not a particularly heavy car, and consequently I do not expect higher tire wear.

*At [Carsized](https://carsized.com) you can compare car sizes.
Here is the Grand Scenic and the Megane e-Tech, as seen from the side.*

We bought this car pre-owned.
It was a demonstrator at the dealership, which we got at a good price.
There were several problems with the car, which took a long time to resolve:
several missing software updates and, consequently, a lighting system malfunction;
a problem with the driver profile (the car would not store seat positions);
and several other comfort features.

It turned out that the dealership did an incomplete change of ownership,
because identity and car records are stored in many different systems:
in the car, at Google, at Renault, and at Orange, the internet provider used by the car.
Debugging that took them several months,
and then a two-day repair stopover at the dealership to resolve it.
It seems the process is better documented because of that, which is good, I guess.

*Trunk space. Limited, if you come from a Grand Scenic, but sufficient.
If you flip one or both back seats, things are possible.
Unlike the Scenic, this does not load flat.*

*Sub-trunk: Storage for the charge cable and other utensils.
We never use that charge cable: When not driving long-distance, we charge at home.
On long distance, fast chargers are being used. They have their own cables.*

Since this intervention, the car has had zero problems.

Driving electric is a revelation.
It is silent.
Power is just there—no delay, no issues at low speeds, and then continuously as you accelerate.

Accelerating in Sport mode is hilarious, and uses insane amounts of energy.
It is fun, though, to leave a car four times the price in the dust at a traffic light.

# Summary

This is a modern car.
That means it is a rolling bunker.
Outward visibility is poor: the A-pillar is so wide it creates blind spots,
and vision through the tiny window in the back is so bad that the rear mirror is a camera system.

*What it looks like from the center spot. Notice the monstrously wide A-pillars.*

I understand why: EU regulation (GSR-2) demands it, but it still sucks.
There are a sufficient number of cameras, collision warnings and similar things to compensate,
but you really do need these things in order to drive safely.

*A fake 3D drone view synthesized from the various camera images. 
It gives you a good idea of what happens around you when parking.*

In the end I do not really think it's a win, but it works.

Sometimes I go to Germany in a rental car because my wife needs the Megane at home.
This is usually a car with a combustion engine.
That sucks—driving electric spoils you.
It is so much more convenient and comfortable.

We will never go back to combustion.
This is so much better.
